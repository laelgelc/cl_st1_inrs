I will tell you very simply. We won the election. Elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all. Top, top academic, good in every way. Good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think she\u2019s going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself. I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding. She\u2019s going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that. We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, said she\u2019s the single greatest student he\u2019s ever had. He\u2019s been a professor for a long time at a great school. And we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise. And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldn\u2019t even think about not doing it. The only difference is they\u2019d try and do it faster. There\u2019s no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn\u2019t have the election so they were stopped. And probably that would happen in reverse, also. Definitely would happen in reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris."}

They\u2019re not going to get that chance now because we\u2019re in the middle of an election already. The election has already started. Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that\u2019s the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President. Now, what\u2019s at stake here is the President\u2019s made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He\u2019s been running on that, he ran on that and he\u2019s been governing on that. He\u2019s in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court. And the justice, I\u2019m not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. But she\u2019s written, before she went in the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not Constitutional. The other thing that\u2019s on the court, and if it\u2019s struck down, what happens? Women\u2019s rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. They\u2019re able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets. And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and there\u2019s a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and they\u2019ll be taken away as well. Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. And so it\u2019s just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the Senate is Republican, then he goes forward. If not, we should wait until February."}

As far as the church is concerned, and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 200\u2013250 military leaders and generals, total support. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. I have Florida. I have Texas. I have Ohio. I have every\u2026 Excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said, \u201cI support President Trump.\u201d I don\u2019t think you have any law enforcement. You can\u2019t even say the word law enforcement. Because if you say those words, you\u2019re going to lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren\u2019t you saying those words, Joe? Why don\u2019t you say the words law enforcement? Because you know what? If they called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour. But they won\u2019t do it, because they\u2019re run by radical left Democrats. If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle. Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe, because we believe in law and order, but you don\u2019t. The top 10 cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats, and in many cases radical left. And they\u2019ve got you wrapped around their finger, Joe, to a point where you don\u2019t want to say anything about law and order. And I\u2019ll tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you\u2019re afraid to even say it."}

Well, the American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country. And here are the facts. 210,000 dead people in our country in just the last several months. Over 7 million people who have contracted this disease. One in five businesses closed. We\u2019re looking at frontline workers who have been treated like sacrificial workers. We are looking at over 30 million people who in the last several months had to file for unemployment. And here\u2019s the thing, on January 28, the vice president and the president were informed about the nature of this pandemic. They were informed that it\u2019s lethal in consequence, that it is airborne, that it will affect young people and that it would be contracted because it is airborne. And they knew what was happening, and they didn\u2019t tell you. Can you imagine if you knew on January 28, as opposed to March 13, what they knew what you might have done to prepare? They knew and they covered it up. The president said it was a hoax. They minimized the seriousness of it. The president said you\u2019re on one side of his ledger if you wear a mask, you\u2019re on the other side of his ledger if you don\u2019t. And in spite of all of that, today they still don\u2019t have a plan. They still don\u2019t have a plan. Well, Joe Biden does. And our plan is about what we need to do around a national strategy for contact tracing, for testing, for administration of the vaccine and making sure that it will be free for all. That is the plan that Joe Biden has and that I have, knowing that we have to get a hold of what has been going on and we need to save our country. And Joe Biden is the best leader to do that and frankly, this administration has forfeited their right to reelection, based on this."}

And I want to thank the Commission and the University of Utah for hosting this event. And Senator Harris, it\u2019s a privilege to be on the stage with you. Our nation has gone through a very challenging time this year. But I want the American people to know that from the very first day, President Donald Trump has put the health of America first. Before there were more than five cases in the United States, all people who had returned from China, President Donald Trump did what no other American president had ever done. And that was he suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now, Senator, Joe Biden opposed that decision. He said it was xenophobic and hysterical, but I can tell you, having led the White House Coronavirus Task Force, that that decision alone by President Trump bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War II. And I believe it\u2019s saved hundreds of thousands of American lives. Because with that time we were able to reinvent testing. More than 115 million tests have been done to date. We were able to see to the delivery of billions of supplies so our doctors and nurses had the resources and support they needed. And we began, really before the month of February it was hard to develop a vaccine and to develop medicines and therapeutics that\u2019ve been saving lives all along the way. And under President Trump\u2019s leadership, Operation Warp Speed, we believe, will have literally tens of millions of doses of a vaccine before the end of this year. The reality is, when you look at the Biden plan, it reads an awful lot like what President Trump and I and our task force have been doing every step of the way. And quite frankly, when I look at their plan that talks about advancing testing, creating new PPE, developing a vaccine, umm, it looks a little bit like plagiarism, which is something Joe Biden knows a little bit about. I think the American people know that this is a president who has put the health of America first and the American people, I believe with my heart, can be proud of the sacrifices they have made. It\u2019s saved countless American lives."}

And you know, the vice president is the head of the task force and knew, on January 28, how serious this was. And then, big thanks to Bob Woodward, we learned that they knew about it. And then when that was exposed, the vice president said when asked \u2018Well, why didn\u2019t y\u2019all tell anybody?\u2019, he said \u2018Because the president wanted people to remain calm\u2019."}

In the height of the epidemic, when we were losing a heartbreaking number of 2,500 Americans a day, we surged resources to New Jersey, and New York, and New Orleans and Detroit. We told the American people what needed to be done and the American people made the sacrifices. When the outbreak in the Sunbelt happened this summer, again, Americans stepped forward.

And we\u2019re right now producing tens of millions of doses. So, the fact that you continue to undermine public confidence in a vaccine if the vaccine emerges during the Trump administration, I think is unconscionable. And Senator, I just ask you, stop playing politics with people\u2019s lives. The reality is that we will have a vaccine, we believe, before the end of this year, and it will have the capacity to save countless American lives. And your continuous undermining of confidence in a vaccine is just, it\u2019s just unacceptable. And let me also say, you know the reality is when you talk about, about failure in this administration, we actually do know what failure looks like in a pandemic. It was 2009. The Swine Flu arrived in the United States. Thankfully, it was, ended up not being as lethal as the coronavirus. But before the end of the year, when Joe Biden was Vice President of the United States, not seven and a half million people contracted the swine flu, 60 million Americans contracted the swine flu. If the swine flu had been as lethal as the coronavirus in 2009 when Joe Biden was vice president, we would have lost 2 million American lives. His own Chief of Staff Ron Klain would say last year that it was pure luck. That they did \u201ceverything possible wrong\u201d. And we learned from that.

I, you know, I thought about my mother, who came to the United States at the age of 19, gave birth to me at the age of 25 at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California. And the thought that I\u2019d be sitting here right now I know would make her proud and she must be looking down on this. You know Joe and I were raised in a very similar way. We were raised with values that are about hard work, about the value and the dignity of public service and about the importance of fighting for the dignity of all people. And I think Joe asked me to serve with him because I have a career that included being elected the first woman District Attorney of San Francisco, where I created models of innovation for law enforcement, in terms of reform of the criminal justice system. I was elected the first woman of color, and black woman, to be elected Attorney General of the state of California, where I ran the second largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice. There I took on everything from transnational criminal organizations, to the big banks that were taking advantage of homeowners, to for profit colleges that were taking advantage of veterans. And then, of course, now I serve in the United States Senate as only the second black woman ever elected to the United States Senate. I serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee where I\u2019ve been in regular receipt of classified information about threats to our nation and hotspots around the world. I\u2019ve traveled the world. I\u2019ve met with our soldiers in our, in war zones. And I think Joe has asked me to serve with him because he knows that we share, we share a purpose, which is about lifting up the American people.

But the care the president received at Walter Reed Hospital, White House doctors, was exceptional. And the transparency that they practiced all along the way will continue because the American people have a right to know about the health and well-being of their President. And we\u2019ll continue to do that. But I\u2019m just extremely grateful and was more than, more than a little moved by the broad and bipartisan support.

We now know because of great investigative journalism that Donald Trump paid $750 in taxes. When I first heard about it, I literally said \u201cYou mean $750,000?\u201d. And it was like no, $750. We now know Donald Trump owes and is in debt for $400 million. And just so everyone is clear, when we say in debt it means you owe money to somebody. And it\u2019d be really good to know who the President of the United States, the Commander in Chief, owes money to because the American people have a right to know what is influencing the president\u2019s decisions. And is he making those decisions on the best interest of the American people, of you, or self interest. So, Susan, I\u2019m glad you asked about transparency, because it has to be across the board. Joe has been incredibly transparent over many, many years. The one thing we all know about Joe, he puts it all out there. He, he is honest. He is forthright.

On the issue of the economy, I think there couldn\u2019t be a more fundamental difference between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Joe Biden believes you measure the health and the strength of America\u2019s economy based on the health, and the strength of the American worker and the American family. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who measures the strength of the economy based on how rich people are doing. Which is why he passed a tax bill benefitting the top 1% and the biggest corporations of America, leading to a $2 trillion deficit that the American people are gonna have to pay for. On day one, Joe Biden will repeal that tax bill. He\u2019ll get rid of it. And what he\u2019ll do with the money is invest it in the American people. And through a plan that is about investing in infrastructure, something that Donald Trump said he would do. I remember hearing about some infrastructure week, I don\u2019t think it ever happened. But Joe Biden will do that. He\u2019ll invest in infrastructure. It\u2019s about upgrading our roads and bridges, but also investing in clean energy and renewable energy. Joe is gonna invest that money in what we need to do around innovation. There was a time when our country believed in science and invested in research and development so that we were an innovation leader on the globe. Joe Biden will use that money to invest in education. So for example, for folks who want to go to a two year Community College, it will be free. If you come from a family that makes less than $125,000, you\u2019ll go to a public university for free. And across the board, we\u2019ll make sure that if you have student loan debt it\u2019s cut by $10,000. That\u2019s how Joe Biden thinks about the economy, which is it\u2019s about investing in the people of our country, as opposed to passing a tax bill, which had the benefit of letting American corporations go offshore to do their business."}

We literally have spared no expense to help the American people and the American worker through this. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want to raise taxes.

Now Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, would put us back in the Paris Climate Accord. They\u2019d impose the Green New Deal, which would crush American energy, would increase the energy cost of American families in their homes and literally would crush American jobs. President Trump and I believe that the progress that we have made in a cleaner environment has been happening precisely because we have a strong free market economy. You know what\u2019s remarkable is the United States has reduced CO2 more than the countries that are still in the Paris Climate Accord, but we\u2019ve done it through innovation. And we\u2019ve done it through natural gas and fracking, which, Senator, the American people can go look at the record.

That is a fact. That is a fact. I will repeat that Joe Biden has been very clear that he thinks about growing jobs, which is why he will not increase taxes for anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. Joe Biden\u2019s economic plan \u2013 Moody\u2019s, which is a reputable Wall Street firm \u2013 has said will create 7 million more jobs than Donald Trump\u2019s. And part of those jobs, that will be created by Joe Biden, are going to be about clean energy and renewable energy. Because you see, Joe understands that the West Coast of our country is burning, including my home state of California. Joe sees what is happening on the Gulf states, which are being battered by storms. Joe has seen and talked with the farmers in Iowa, whose entire crops have been destroyed because of floods. And so Joe believes, again, in science. I\u2019ll tell you something, Susan, I served, when I first got to the Senate, on the committee that\u2019s responsible for the environment. Do you know this administration took the word science off the website? And then took the phrase climate change off the website? This\u2013 We have seen a pattern with this administration which is they don\u2019t believe in science. And Joe\u2019s plan is about saying we\u2019re going to deal with it, but we\u2019re also going to create jobs. Donald Trump, when asked about the wildfires in California and the question was, you know, the science is telling us this, you know what Donald Trump said? Science doesn\u2019t know. So, let\u2019s talk about who is prepared to lead our country over the course of the next four years on what is an existential threat to us as human beings. Joe is about saying we\u2019re going to invest that in renewable energy, we\u2019re going to be about the creation of millions of jobs, we will achieve net zero emissions by 2050, carbon neutral by 2035\u2013 Joe has a plan.

Well let me, before I leave that, let me, let me speak to voting records, if I can. You know, everybody knows that NAFTA caused literally thousands of American factories to close. We saw automotive jobs go south of the border. President Trump fought to renegotiate NAFTA, and the United States, Mexico, Canada agreement is now the law of the land. American people deserve to know Senator Kamala Harris was one of only 10 members of the Senate to vote against the USMCA. It was a huge win for American auto workers. It was a huge win for American farmers, especially dairy in the upper Midwest. But, Senator, you said it didn\u2019t go far enough on climate change, that you put your, your radical environmental agenda ahead of American auto workers and ahead of American jobs. I think the American people deserve to know that. It\u2019s probably why Newsweek magazine said that, that Kamala Harris was the most liberal member of the United States Senate in 2019, more liberal than Bernie Sanders, more, more liberal than any of the others in the United States Senate. So, now with regard to China, Susan, first and foremost \u2014 China is to blame for the coronavirus. And President Trump is not happy about it. He\u2019s made that very clear. He made it clear again today. China and the World Health Organization did not play straight with the American people. They did not let our personnel into China to get information on the coronavirus until the middle of February. Fortunately, President Trump, in dealing with China from the outset of this administration \u2014 standing up to China, that had been taking advantage of America for decades \u2014 in the wake of Joe Biden\u2019s cheerleading for China, President Trump made that decision before the end of January to suspend all travel from China. And again, the American people deserve to know, Joe Biden opposed President Trump\u2019s decision to suspend all travel from China. He said it was hysterical, he said it was xenophobic \u2013"}

It resulted in the loss of over 300 manufacturing jobs, and a manufacturing recession, and the American consumer paying thousands of dollars more for goods, because of that failed war, that they called it. And let\u2019s talk about standing. Pew, a reputable research firm, has done an analysis that shows that leaders of all of our formerly allied countries have now decided that they hold in greater esteem and respect Xi Jinping, the head of the Chinese Communist Party, than they do Donald Trump, the President of the United States, the commander in chief of the United States. This is where we are today, because of a failure of leadership by this administration."}

He says, you know, \u2018Foreign policy: it might sound complicated, but really it\u2019s relationships, they\u2019re \u2013 just think about it as relationships. And so we know this, in our personal, professional relationships \u2013 you gotta keep your word to your friends. Got to be loyal to your friends. People who have stood with you, got to stand with them. You got to know who your adversaries are, and keep them in check. But what we have seen with Donald Trump is that he has betrayed our friends and embraced dictators around the world. Let\u2019s take for example, Russia. So, Russia \u2013 I serve on the Intelligence Committee of the United States Senate. America\u2019s intelligence community told us Russia interfered in the election of the President of the United States in 2016 and is playing in 2020. Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI, said the same, but Donald Trump, the commander in chief of the United States of America prefers to take the word of Vladimir Putin over the word of the American intelligence community. You look at our friends at NATO. He has walked away from agreements \u2013 you can look at the Iran nuclear deal, which now has put us in a position where we are less safe, because they are building up what might end up being a significant nuclear arsenal. We were in that deal, guys, we were in the Iran nuclear deal with friends, with allies around the country, and because of Donald Trump\u2019s unilateral approach to foreign policy, coupled with his isolationism, he pulled us out and has made America less safe. So Susan, it\u2019s about relationships. And the thing that has always been part of the strength of our nation, in addition to our great military, has been that we keep our word. But Donald Trump doesn\u2019t understand that, because he doesn\u2019t understand what it means to be honest."}

Well, President Trump kept his word when we moved the American Embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Israel. When Joe Biden was vice president, they promised to do that and never did. We\u2019ve stood strong with our allies, but we\u2019ve been demanding. NATO is now contributing more to our common defense than ever before. Thanks to President Trump\u2019s leadership, we\u2019ve strengthen our alliances across the Asia Pacific. And we\u2019ve stood strong against those who would do us harm. You know when President Trump came into office, ISIS had captured an area of the Middle East, the size of Pennsylvania. President Trump unleashed the American military, and our armed forces destroyed the ISIS caliphate and took down their leader al Baghdadi without one American casualty. al Baghdadi was responsible for the death of thousands. But notably, America\u2019s hearts today are with the family of Kayla Mueller, the parents of which are here with us tonight in Salt Lake City. Today, two of the ISIS killers responsible for Kayla Mueller\u2019s murder, were brought to justice in the United States. Jihadi John was killed on the battlefield, along with the other few. The reality is that when Joe Biden was vice president, we had an opportunity to save Kayla Mueller. Breaks my heart to reflect on it, but the military came into the Oval Office, presented a plan. They said they knew where Kayla was. Baghdadi had held her for 18 months, abused her mercilessly before they killed her. But when Joe Biden was vice president, they hesitated for a month. And when Armed Forces finally went in, it was clear she\u2019d been moved two days earlier, and her family says \u2014 with a heart that broke the heart of every American \u2014 that if President Donald Trump had been president, they believe Kayla would be alive today."}

But you mentioned Soleimani. Let\u2019s start there. So, after the strike on Soleimani, there was a counter strike on our troops in Iraq. And they suffered serious brain injuries, and do you know what Donald Trump dismissed them as? Headaches. And this is about a pattern of Donald Trump\u2019s, where he has referred to our men who are serving in our military, as suckers and losers. Donald Trump, who went to Arlington Cemetery, and stood above the graves of our fallen heroes and said, \u2018What\u2019s in it for them?\u2019 Because, of course, you know he only thinks about what\u2019s in it for him.

Public reporting that Russia had bounties on the heads of American soldiers, and you know what a bounty is? Somebody puts a price on your head, and they will pay it if you are killed. And Donald Trump had talked at least six times to Vladmir Putin, and never brought up the subject. Joe Biden would never do that. Joe Biden \u2013 Joe Biden would hold Russia to account for any threat to our nation\u2019s security or to our troops who are sacrificing their lives for the sake of our democracy and our safety."}

The American people deserve to know, Quasem Soleimani, the Iranian general, was responsible for the death of hundreds of American servicemembers. When the opportunity came, we saw him headed to Baghdad to kill more Americans, President Trump didn\u2019t hesitate and Quasem Soleimani is gone. But you deserve to know that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris actually criticized the decision to take out Quasem Soleimani. It\u2019s really inexplicable, but with regard to Joe Biden it\u2019s explainable, because history records that Joe Biden actually opposed the raid against Osama bin Laden. It\u2019s absolutely essential that we have a commander in chief who will not hesitate to act to protect American lives and to protect American servicemembers, and that\u2019s what you have in President Donald Trump. Now with regard to the Supreme Court of the United States. Let me say, President Trump and I could not be more enthusiastic about the opportunity to see Judge Amy Coney Barrett become Justice Amy Coney Barrett. She\u2019s a brilliant woman, and she will bring a lifetime of experience and a sizable American family, to the Supreme Court of the United States. And our hope is, in the hearing next week, unlike Justice Kavanaugh received with treatment from you and others. We hope she gets a fair hearing. And we particularly hope that we don\u2019t see the kind of attacks on her Christian faith that we saw before. Democratic Chairman of the Judiciary Committee before, when Judge Barrett was being confirmed for the Court of Appeals, expressed concern that the \u201cdogma of her faith lived loudly in her.\u201d Dick Durbin of Illinois said that it was a concern. Senator, I know one of our judicial nominees, you actually attacked because they were a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus, just because the Knights of Columbus holds pro-life views."}

First of all, Joe Biden and I are both people of faith. And it\u2019s insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith, and in fact, Joe if elected will be only the second practicing Catholic, as President of the United States. On the issue of this nomination \u2013 Joe and I are very clear, as are the majority of the American people. We are 27 days before the decision about who will be the next president of the United States. And you know before, when this conversation has come up, you know it\u2019s been about election year or election time. We\u2019re literally in an election. Over 4 million people have voted. People are in the process of voting right now. And so Joe has been very clear, as the American people are: Let the American people fill that seat in the White House, and then we\u2019ll fill that seat on the United States Supreme Court. And to your point, Susan, the issues before us couldn\u2019t be more serious. There\u2019s the issue of choice, and I will always fight for a woman\u2019s right to make a decision about her own body. It should be her decision and not that of Donald Trump, and the Vice President, Michael Pence. But let\u2019s also look at what else is before the court. It\u2019s the Affordable Care Act. Like, literally in the midst of a public health pandemic \u2013 when over 210,000 people have died and 7 million people probably have what will be in the future considered a pre-existing condition because you contracted the virus \u2013 Donald Trump is in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I\u2019ve said it before and it bears repeating: This means that there will be no more protections, if they win, for people with pre-existing conditions. This means that over 20 million people will lose your coverage. It means that if you\u2019re under the age of 26, you can\u2019t stay on your parents coverage anymore. And here\u2019s the thing. The contrast couldn\u2019t be more clear. They\u2019re trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Joe Biden is saying let\u2019s expand coverage, let\u2019s give you a choice of a public option or private coverage, let\u2019s bring down premiums, let\u2019s lower Medicare eligibility to 60. That\u2019s true leadership."}

Let me just say, addressing your very first question, I couldn\u2019t be more proud to serve as vice president to a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. I\u2019m pro-life. I don\u2019t apologize for it. And this is another one of those cases where there\u2019s such a dramatic contrast. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion, all the way up to the moment of birth, late-term abortion. They want to increase funding to Planned Parenthood of America. Now for our part, I would never presume how Judge Amy Coney Barrett would rule on the Supreme Court of the United States but we\u2019ll continue to stand strong for the right to life. When you speak about the Supreme Court, though, I think the American people really deserve an answer, Senator Harris. Are you and Joe Biden gonna pack the court if Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed? I mean, there have been 29 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years, from George Washington to Barack Obama. Presidents have nominated in all 29 cases. But your party is actually openly advocating adding seats to the Supreme Court, which has had nine seats for 150 years, if you don\u2019t get your way. This is a classic case of if you can\u2019t win by the rules, you\u2019re going to change the rules. Now you\u2019ve refused to answer the question, Joe Biden has refused to answer the question. I think the American people would really like to know. If Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States, are you and Joe Biden, if somehow you win this election, going to pack the Supreme Court to get your way?"}

Abraham Lincoln was up for reelection, and it was 27 days before the election, and a seat became open on the United States Supreme Court. Abraham Lincoln\u2019s party was in charge, not only in the White House, but the Senate. But honest Abe said it\u2019s not the right thing to do.

And her life was taken, unjustifiably and tragically and violently. And it just, it brings me to, you know, the eight minutes and 46 seconds that America witnessed, during which an American man was tortured and killed under the knee of an armed, uniformed police officer. And people around our country, of every race, of every age, of every gender \u2013 perfect strangers to each other \u2013 marched shoulder to shoulder, arm and arm, fighting for us to finally achieve that ideal of equal justice under law. And I was a part of those peaceful protests.

We need reform of our policing in America and our criminal justice system, which is why Joe and I will immediately ban chokeholds and carotid holds. George Floyd would be alive today if we did that. We will require a national registry for police officers who break the law, we will \u2013 on the issue of criminal justice reform \u2013 get rid of private prisons and cash bail and we will decriminalize marijuana, and we will expunge the records of those who have been convicted of marijuana.

And with regard to George Floyd, there\u2019s no excuse for what happened to George Floyd. Justice will be served. But there\u2019s also no excuse for the rioting and looting that followed. I mean, it really is astonishing. Flora Westbrook is with us here tonight in Salt Lake City. Just a few weeks ago, I stood at what used to be her salon, was burned to the ground. By rioters and looters. And Flora is still trying to put her life back together. And I must tell ya, this, this presumption that you hear consistently from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, that America is systemically racist. That as Joe Biden said, that he believes that law enforcement has an implicit bias against minorities, is a great insult to the men and women who serve in law enforcement. And I want everyone to know, who puts on the uniform of law enforcement every day, that President Trump and I stand with you. It is remarkable that when Senator Tim Scott tried to pass a police reform bill, brought together a group of Republicans and Democrats \u2013 Senator Harris, you got up and walked out of the room. And then you filibustered Senator Tim Scott\u2019s bill on the Senate floor that would have provided new accountability, new resources.

Joe and I are particularly proud of the coalition that we\u2019ve built around our campaign. We probably have one of the broadest coalitions of folks that you\u2019ve ever seen in a presidential race. Of course we have the support of Democrats, but also independents and Republicans, in fact, seven members of President George W. Bush\u2019s cabinet are supporting our ticket. We have the support of Colin Powell, Cindy McCain, John Kasich, over 500 generals, retired generals, and former national security experts and advisors are supporting our campaign. And I believe they are doing that because they know that Joe Biden has a deep, deep seated commitment to fight for our democracy, and to fight for the integrity of our democracy, and to bring integrity back to the White House.

Joe Biden, on the other hand, on that same debate stage \u2013 because clearly Donald Trump doesn\u2019t think he can run on a record because it\u2019s a failed record \u2013 Joe Biden on that stage, said, \u2018Hey, just please vote.\u2019 So I\u2019ll repeat what Joe said.

Because while Joe Biden and Kamala Harris rattle off a long litany, the establishment in Washington DC and the establishment Joe Biden\u2019s been a part of for 47 years. President Donald Trump has launched a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life. And I have every confidence that the same Americans that delivered that historic victory in 2016, they see this President\u2019s record, where we rebuild our military, we revived our economy through tax cuts and rolling back regulation, fighting for fair trade, unleashing American energy. We appointed conservatives to our federal courts at every level. And we stood with the men and women of law enforcement every single day, and I think, I think that movement of Americans has only grown stronger in the last four years. When you talk about accepting the outcome of the election, I must tell you, Senator, your party has spent the last three and a half years trying to overturn the results of the last election. It\u2019s amazing. When Joe Biden was vice president of the United States, the FBI actually spied on President Trump and my campaign. I mean there were documents released this week that the CIA actually made a referral to the FBI documenting that those allegations were coming from the Hillary Clinton campaign, and of course, we\u2019ve all seen the avalanche with the \u2014 what, what you put the country through, for the better part of three years, until it was found that there was no obstruction, no collusion, case closed. And then Senator Harris, you and your colleagues in the Congress tried to impeach the President of the United States, over a phone call. And now Hillary Clinton has actually said to Joe Biden that under, in her words, under no circumstances should he concede the election. So let me just say, I think we\u2019re gonna win this election. President Trump and I are fighting every day in courthouses to prevent Joe Biden and Kamala Harris from changing the rules and creating this universal mail-in voting, that\u2019ll create a massive opportunity for voter fraud. We have a free and fair election; we know we\u2019re going to have confidence in it. And I believe in all my heart that President Donald Trump\u2019s gonna be reelected for four more years."}

And let me just commend you for taking an interest in public life. I started following the news when I was very young. And in America, we believe in a free and open exchange of debate.

I would tell you that \u2013 don\u2019t assume that what you\u2019re seeing on your local news networks is synonymous with the American people. You know, I look at the relationship between Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the late justice who we just lost from the Supreme Court, and the late Justice Antonin Scalia. They were on polar opposites, on the Supreme Court of the United States \u2013 one very liberal, one very conservative. But what\u2019s been learned since her passing was the two of them and their families were the very closest of friends. Here in America, we can disagree, we can debate vigorously as Senator Harris and I have on this stage tonight. But when the debate is over, we come together as Americans. And that\u2019s what people do in big cities and small towns all across this country, so I just want to encourage you, Brecklynn, I want to tell you that we\u2019re going to work every day to have a government as good as our people, the American people, each and every day. We love a good debate. We love a good argument. But we always come together and are always there for one another in times of need.

And that you know that brings me to Joe. Joe Biden \u2013 one of the reasons that Joe decided to run for president, is after Charlottesville, which we talked about earlier, it so troubled him and upset him, like it did all of us, that there was that kind of hate and division. What propelled Joe to run for president was to see that, over the course of the last four years, what Brecklynn described has been happening. Joe has a long-standing reputation of working across the aisle and working in a bipartisan way. And that\u2019s what he\u2019s going to do as President. Joe Biden has a history of lifting people up and fighting for their dignity. You mean you have to know Joe\u2019s story to know that Joe has known pain, he has known suffering, and he has known love. And so, Brecklynn, when you think about the future, I do believe the future is bright. And it will be because of your leadership, and it will be, because we fight for each person\u2019s voice through their vote.

Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate. That is the worst part of Obamacare, as we call it. The individual mandate \u2013 where you have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance. I terminated it; it\u2019s gone. Now it\u2019s in court, because Obamacare is no good. But then I made a decision, \u2018Run it as well as you can\u2019 \u2014 to my people, great people \u2014 \u2018Run it as well as you can.\u2019 I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy. They ran it. Premiums are down, everything\u2019s down. Here\u2019s the problem. No matter how well you run it, it\u2019s no good. What we\u2019d like to do is terminate it. We have the individual mandate done. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s going to work. If we don\u2019t win, we will have to run it and we\u2019ll have Obamacare, but it will be better run. But it no longer is Obamacare. Because without the individual mandate, it\u2019s much different. Pre-existing conditions will always stay. What I would like to do is a much better health care, much better. We\u2019ll always protect people with pre-existing \u2014 so I\u2019d like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new beautiful health care. The Democrats will do it because there\u2019ll be tremendous pressure on them. And we might even have the House by that time. And I think we\u2019re going to win the House, okay? You\u2019ll see, but I think we\u2019re gonna win the House. But come up with a better health care, always protecting people with pre-existing conditions \u2014 and one thing very important. We have 180 million people out there that have great private health care, far more than we\u2019re talking about with Obamacare. Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies. These are people that love their health care, people that have been successful \u2014 middle income people \u2014 been successful. They have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine. He won\u2019t even have a choice.

Public option is an option that says that if you, in fact, do not have the wherewithal to be \u2014 if you qualify for Medicaid, and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get Medicaid, you automatically are enrolled, providing competition for insurance companies. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. Secondly, we\u2019re going to make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there\u2019s competition that doesn\u2019t exist now by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies. Thirdly, the idea that I want to eliminate private insurance \u2014 the reason why I had such a fight for, with 20 candidates for the nomination, was I support private insurance. That\u2019s why I did not \u2014 not one single person, private insurance, would lose their insurance under my plan, nor did they under Obamacare. They did not lose their insurance, unless they chose they wanted to go to something else. Lastly, we\u2019re going to make sure we\u2019re in a situation that we actually protect pre-existing \u2014 there\u2019s no way he can protect pre-existing conditions. None, zero, you can\u2019t do it in the ether. He\u2019s been talking about this for a long time. There is no \u2014 he\u2019s never come up with a plan. I guess we\u2019re gonna get the pre-existing condition plan the same time we get the infrastructure plan that we waited since 17, 18, 19, 20. The fact\u00a0 \u2014 I still have a little, a few more minutes, I know you\u2019re getting anxious \u2014 the fact is that he\u2019s already cost the American people because of his terrible handling of the COVID virus and economic spillover. 10 million people have lost their private insurance, and he wants to take away 22 million more people who have been under Obamacare, and over 110 million people with pre-existing conditions. And all the people from COVID are going to have pre-existing conditions. What are they gonna do?"}

The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we\u2019ll build together. Today is my granddaughter\u2019s second birthday, so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes. I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women\u2019s work. I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top. And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. I\u2019ve heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you\u2019re under. So let\u2019s have paid family leave, earned sick days. Let\u2019s be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college. How are we going to do it? We\u2019re going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes. Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it\u2019s good to be with you. We\u2019re going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better. I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th."}

Our jobs are fleeing the country. They\u2019re going to Mexico. They\u2019re going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. They\u2019re devaluing their currency, and there\u2019s nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because they\u2019re using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing. So we\u2019re losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at what\u2019s happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it\u2019s the eighth wonder of the world. They\u2019re building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much. So Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They\u2019re all leaving. And we can\u2019t allow it to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we\u2019re going to do, but perhaps we\u2019ll be talking about that later. But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis. They left\u2014fired 1,400 people. They\u2019re going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this. We cannot let it happen. Under my plan, I\u2019ll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. That\u2019s going to be a job creator like we haven\u2019t seen since Ronald Reagan. It\u2019s going to be a beautiful thing to watch. Companies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs."}

Of course, we are 5 percent of the world\u2019s population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent. And we need to have smart, fair trade deals. We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions. And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again. In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we\u2019ve ever had. I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that\u2019s exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy. We just have a different view about what\u2019s best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes. I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives. I understand that. You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that\u2019s all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we\u2019ll be and that everything will work out from there. I don\u2019t buy that. I have a different experience. My father was a small-businessman. He worked really hard. He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going. And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we\u2019ll grow. That\u2019s the kind of economy I want us to see again."}

Our country\u2019s in deep trouble. We don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China. They\u2019re the best, the best ever at it. What they\u2019re doing to us is a very, very sad thing. So we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals. And, Lester, they\u2019re taking our jobs, they\u2019re giving incentives, they\u2019re doing things that, frankly, we don\u2019t do. Let me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. We\u2019re on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, there\u2019s a tax. When they sell in\u2014automatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, there\u2019s no tax. It\u2019s a defective agreement. It\u2019s been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven\u2019t done anything about it. Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton\u2014yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It\u2019s very important to me. But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently. She\u2019s been doing this for 30 years. And why hasn\u2019t she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact\u2026"}

And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think you\u2019re going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you\u2019re wrong. And once you say you\u2019re going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies.

We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm. In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said, back in 2006, \u201cGee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.\u201d Well, it did collapse."}

So we\u2019re now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place. Independent experts have looked at what I\u2019ve proposed and looked at what Donald\u2019s proposed, and basically they\u2019ve said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession. They\u2019ve looked at my plans and they\u2019ve said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy. Take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century. Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it\u2019s real."}

That\u2019s a lot of jobs; that\u2019s a lot of new economic activity. So I\u2019ve tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we\u2019re going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we\u2019ve made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place."}

We invested in a solar company, our country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one. Now, look, I\u2019m a great believer in all forms of energy, but we\u2019re putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster. Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. You can\u2019t do what you\u2019re looking to do with $20 trillion in debt. The Obama administration, from the time they\u2019ve come in, is over 230 years\u2019 worth of debt, and he\u2019s topped it. He\u2019s doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact. So I will tell you this. We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs. And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they\u2019re not doing it. And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they\u2019re gone. And, Hillary, I\u2019d just ask you this. You\u2019ve been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now?

And are they good for our national security? Some of them I voted for. The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against. And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals. But let\u2019s not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy. I think it is a part of it, and I\u2019ve said what I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019m going to have a special prosecutor. We\u2019re going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we\u2019re going to hold people accountable. When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent.

So what they\u2019re doing is they\u2019re leaving our country, and they\u2019re, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country.

And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that\u2019s going to come crashing down. We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble. And we better be awfully careful. And we have a Fed that\u2019s doing political things. This Janet Yellen of the Fed. The Fed is doing political\u2014by keeping the interest rates at this level.

For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns. You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it. We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you\u2019re under audit. So you\u2019ve got to ask yourself, why won\u2019t he release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe he\u2019s not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe he\u2019s not as charitable as he claims to be. Third, we don\u2019t know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks. Or maybe he doesn\u2019t want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he\u2019s paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody\u2019s ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn\u2019t pay any federal income tax."}

And the financial disclosure statements, they don\u2019t give you the tax rate. They don\u2019t give you all the details that tax returns would. And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see. And I have no reason to believe that he\u2019s ever going to release his tax returns, because there\u2019s something he\u2019s hiding. And we\u2019ll guess. We\u2019ll keep guessing at what it might be that he\u2019s hiding. But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts? Who does he owe money to?

That was done purposely. OK? That was not a mistake. That was done purposely. When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they\u2019re not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it\u2019s disgraceful. And believe me, this country thinks it\u2019s\u2014really thinks it\u2019s disgraceful, also. As far as my tax returns, you don\u2019t learn that much from tax returns. That I can tell you. You learn a lot from financial disclosure. And you should go down and take a look at that. The other thing, I\u2019m extremely underleveraged. The report that said $650\u2014which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that\u2019s really not a lot of money. It\u2019s not a lot of money relative to what I had. The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was\u2014actually, it wasn\u2019t even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion. And the $650 isn\u2019t even on that. But it\u2019s not $650. It\u2019s much less than that. But I could give you a list of banks, I would\u2014if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks. These are very fine institutions, very fine banks. I could do that very quickly. I am very underleveraged. I have a great company. I have a tremendous income. And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way. It\u2019s because it\u2019s about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money. When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country\u2019s a mess, you know, it\u2019s one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything\u2019s in great shape, our airports. Our airports are like from a third world country. You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible\u2014you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land\u2014we\u2019ve become a third world country. So the worst of all things has happened. We owe $20 trillion, and we\u2019re a mess. We haven\u2019t even started. And we\u2019ve spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw. Whether it\u2019s 6 or 5, but it looks like it\u2019s 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice. And it\u2019s really a shame. And it\u2019s politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. We\u2019re a debtor nation. We\u2019re a serious debtor nation. And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we don\u2019t have the money, because it\u2019s been squandered on so many of your ideas."}

Now, if you want to change the laws, you\u2019ve been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I\u2019m running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And that\u2019s what I do.

But we\u2019re opening the Old Post Office. Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money. I\u2019m a year ahead of schedule. And that\u2019s what this country should be doing.

Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they\u2019re treated in the criminal justice system. We\u2019ve just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte. And we\u2019ve got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police. We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they\u2019re well prepared to use force only when necessary. Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law. Right now, that\u2019s not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods. So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform. I\u2019ve laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system. But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform. So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. And we\u2019ve got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together. So we have to do two things, as I said. We have to restore trust. We have to work with the police. We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them. And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we\u2019re seeing today."}

We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very\u2014I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States. We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in hell because it\u2019s so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot. In Chicago, they\u2019ve had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shootings. And I\u2019m saying, where is this? Is this a war-torn country? What are we doing? And we have to stop the violence. We have to bring back law and order. In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over\u2014almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed. We have to bring back law and order. Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down. But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn\u2019t be having it. We have gangs roaming the street. And in many cases, they\u2019re illegally here, illegal immigrants. And they have guns. And they shoot people. And we have to be very strong. And we have to be very vigilant. We have to be\u2014we have to know what we\u2019re doing. Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything.

I agree with Secretary Clinton on this. You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it\u2019s not good.

There\u2019s a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up. But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe. There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective. Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective. It did not do what it needed to do. Now, I believe in community policing. And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991. Property crime is down 40 percent. We just don\u2019t want to see it creep back up. We\u2019ve had 25 years of very good cooperation. But there were some problems, some unintended consequences. Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses. And it\u2019s just a fact that if you\u2019re a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated. So we\u2019ve got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. We cannot just say law and order. We have to say\u2014we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little. We need to have more second chance programs. I\u2019m glad that we\u2019re ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system. You shouldn\u2019t have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans. So there are some positive ways we can work on this. And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us. Right now\u2014and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby\u2014right now, we\u2019ve got too many military-style weapons on the streets. In a lot of places, our police are outgunned. We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm. And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who\u2019s on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country. If you\u2019re too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way."}

But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers. I\u2019ve met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. They admit it\u2019s an issue. They\u2019ve got a lot of concerns. Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street. They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance. And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that."}

I agree with you. When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I\u2019m very proud of. These are very, very good people, and they\u2019re protecting the Second Amendment. But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldn\u2019t be on there, we\u2019ll help them, we\u2019ll help them legally, we\u2019ll help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly. I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth. And that\u2019s a term that I think was a\u2014it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s been horribly met, as you know. I think you\u2019ve apologized for it. But I think it was a terrible thing to say.

And I don\u2019t think\u2014I really don\u2019t think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth. I think maybe there\u2019s a political reason why you can\u2019t say it, but I really don\u2019t believe\u2014in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders. Five hundred murders is a lot of murders. It\u2019s hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good? But we went from 2,200 to 500. And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg. And it was terminated by current mayor. But stop-and-frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did.

Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe? But let\u2019s also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods.

But it can\u2019t be dismissed that easily. He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen. There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it. But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department. So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one. You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity. And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.

You were after him, you were trying to\u2014you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures. I don\u2019t think you can deny that. But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn\u2019t work. It really doesn\u2019t. Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father\u2019s company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country\u2014it was a federal lawsuit\u2014were sued. We settled the suit with zero\u2014with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do. But they sued many people. I notice you bring that up a lot. And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don\u2019t do on you. Maybe I\u2019m trying to save the money. But, frankly, I look\u2014I look at that, and I say, isn\u2019t that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it\u2019s just one of those things. I\u2019ll go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African-Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And it\u2019s a tremendously successful club. And I\u2019m so glad I did it.

But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states. The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia. There\u2019s no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this. I know Donald\u2019s very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really\u2026  \u2026tough, long game here. And one of the things he\u2019s done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee.

We need to make it very clear\u2014whether it\u2019s Russia, China, Iran or anybody else\u2014the United States has much greater capacity.

And that\u2019s why I was so\u2014I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans. That is just unacceptable.

She\u2019s saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don\u2019t\u2014maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK? You don\u2019t know who broke in to DNC. But what did we learn with DNC? We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Look what happened to her. But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of. That\u2019s what we learned. Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don\u2019t know, because the truth is, under President Obama we\u2019ve lost control of things that we used to have control over. We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they\u2019re beating us at our own game. ISIS. So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is\u2014it is a huge problem. I have a son. He\u2019s 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it\u2019s unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it\u2019s hardly doable. But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But that\u2019s true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them."}

I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS. It does involve going after them online. I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere. But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate. We\u2019re making progress. Our military is assisting in Iraq. And we\u2019re hoping that within the year we\u2019ll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria. But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they\u2019ve had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority. And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership. I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden. And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles. Because we\u2019ve got to defeat ISIS, and we\u2019ve got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online."}

Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS. \u201cWe will take out ISIS.\u201d Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out\u2014what, they shouldn\u2019t have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster. And ISIS was formed. So she talks about taking them out. She\u2019s been doing it a long time. She\u2019s been trying to take them out for a long time. But they wouldn\u2019t have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldn\u2019t have had them. Or, as I\u2019ve been saying for a long time, and I think you\u2019ll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil\u2014and we should have taken the oil\u2014ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil\u2014a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters."}

But the larger point\u2014and he says this constantly\u2014is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama. And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that. But let\u2019s talk about the question you asked, Lester. The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States? That\u2019s the most important part of this. How do we prevent attacks? How do we protect our people? And I think we\u2019ve got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information. I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey. You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami. And they brought him down. And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit. So we\u2019ve got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East. That means we\u2019ve got to work more closely with our allies, and that\u2019s something that Donald has been very dismissive of. We\u2019re working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism. We\u2019re working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations. Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community. They\u2019re on the front lines. They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else. They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald\u2019s rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to."}

But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that\u2019s another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly. They were choking on the sanctions. And now they\u2019re going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they\u2019re going. But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO? And you have to understand, I\u2019m a businessperson. I did really well. But I have common sense. And I said, well, I\u2019ll tell you. I haven\u2019t given lots of thought to NATO. But two things. Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren\u2019t paying their fair share. Number two\u2014and that bothers me, because we should be asking\u2014we\u2019re defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they\u2019re supposed to be paying by treaty and contract. And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because\u2014and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest\u2014but I said, they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times. And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think that\u2019s great. And I think we should get\u2014because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. It\u2019s a lot of money to protect other people. But I\u2019m all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also. And they\u2019re going to do that. And that was\u2014believe me\u2014I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not going to get credit for it\u2014but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO. I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton. And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops. Not only that, you named the day. They couldn\u2019t believe it. They sat back probably and said, I can\u2019t believe it.

Let\u2019s talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO. You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all. And you know the only time it\u2019s ever been invoked? After 9\/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side. With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb. They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration. They had built covert facilities. They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away. And we had sanctioned them. I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn\u2019t enough. So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran. And we did drive them to the negotiating table. And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran\u2019s nuclear program without firing a single shot. That\u2019s diplomacy. That\u2019s coalition-building. That\u2019s working with other nations. The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship. He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I\u2019d blow them out of the water and start another war. That\u2019s not good judgment."}

It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons.

But Russia has been expanding their\u2014they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint. I looked the other night. I was seeing B-52s, they\u2019re old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. We are not\u2014we are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike. I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it\u2019s over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can\u2019t take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we\u2019re doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea. And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I\u2019ve ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal. Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea. And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places. And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn\u2019t you do that? Why didn\u2019t you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobody\u2019s ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way. So you say to yourself, why didn\u2019t they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems. All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don\u2019t have to do much."}

Words matter when you run for president. And they really matter when you are president. And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them. It is essential that America\u2019s word be good. And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and some worries on the part of many leaders across the globe. I\u2019ve talked with a number of them. But I want to\u2014on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good. It\u2019s also important that we look at the entire global situation. There\u2019s no doubt that we have other problems with Iran. But personally, I\u2019d rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that. And Donald never tells you what he would do. Would he have started a war? Would he have bombed Iran? If he\u2019s going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be. But it\u2019s like his plan to defeat ISIS. He says it\u2019s a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan. So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues. People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do. Can they rely on us? Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values? That\u2019s what I intend to do. I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they\u2019re abroad or at home. We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security\u2026"}

It\u2019s deeply humbling for me to be here, to be surrounded by my \u2014 my wonderful family. And, Senator Kaine, it\u2019s an honor to be here with you, as well. And I just \u2014 I also want to say \u2014 I want to say thanks to everyone that\u2019s looking in tonight, who understands what an enormously important time this is in the life of our nation. For the last seven-and-a-half years, we\u2019ve seen America\u2019s place in the world weakened. We\u2019ve seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal, and a failing health care reform come to be known as Obamacare, and the American people know that we need to make a change. And so I want to thank all of you for being \u2014 being with us tonight. I also want to thank Donald Trump for making that call and inviting us to be a part of this ticket. I have to tell you, I\u2019m a \u2014 I\u2019m a small-town boy from a place not too different from Farmville. I grew up with a cornfield in my backyard. My grandfather had immigrated to this country when he was about my son\u2019s age. My mom and dad built a \u2014 everything that matters in a small town in Southern Indiana. They built a family and \u2014 and a good name and a business. And they raised a family. And I dreamed some day of representing my home town in Washington, D.C., but I \u2014 honestly, Elaine, I never imagined \u2014 never imagined I\u2019d have the opportunity to be governor of the state that I love, let alone be sitting at a table like this in this kind of a position. So to answer your question, I would say I \u2014 I would hope that if \u2014 if the responsibility ever fell to me in this role, that I would meet it with the way that I\u2019m going to meet the responsibility should I be elected vice president of the United States. And that\u2019s to bring a lifetime of experience, a lifetime growing up in a small town, a lifetime where I\u2019ve served in the Congress of the United States, where \u2014 where I\u2019ve led a state that works in the great state of Indiana, and whatever other responsibilities might follow from this, I \u2014 I would hope and, frankly, I would pray to be able to meet that moment with that \u2014 that lifetime of experience."}

I mean, I\u2019m very proud of the fact that \u2014 I come from a state that works. The state of Indiana has balanced budgets. We cut taxes, we\u2019ve made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank. That\u2019s a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia. He actually \u2014 he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion. He left his state about $2 billion in the hole. In the state of Indiana, we\u2019ve cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor. But I think he\u2019s a very fitting running mate for Hillary Clinton, because in the wake of a season where American families are struggling in this economy under the weight of higher taxes and Obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same. It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that. You tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful. But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan. But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare. They want to expand it into a single-payer program. And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start. Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy. We can get America moving again. Put on top of that the kind of trade deals that\u2019ll put the American worker first, and you\u2019ve got a prescription for real growth. And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, that\u2019s when you can deal with the national debt. When we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth with Donald Trump\u2019s plan will do, then we\u2019re going to have the resources to meet our nation\u2019s needs at home and abroad, and we\u2019re going to have the ability to bring down the national debt."}

My three brothers and I would marvel at my uncle when he would come out in his uniform, sidearm at his side. Police officers are the best of us. And the men and women, white, African-American, Asian, Latino, Hispanic, they put their lives on the line every single day. And let me say, at the risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea. It\u2019s worked in the Hoosier state. And we fully support that. Donald Trump and I are going to make sure that law enforcement have the resources and the tools to be able to really restore law and order to the cities and communities in this nation.

They see his commitment to law and order. But they also \u2014 they also hear the bad mouthing, the bad mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings as \u2014 as a reason to \u2014 to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of \u2014 of implicit bias or institutional racism. And that really has got to stop. I mean, when an African-American police officer in Charlotte named Brentley Vinson, an all-star football player who went to Liberty University here in the state, came home, followed his dad into law enforcement, joined the force in Charlotte, joined the force in Charlotte in 2014, was involved in a police action shooting that claimed the life of Keith \u2014 Keith Lamont Scott, it was a tragedy. I mean, I \u2014 we \u2014 we mourn with those who mourn. We \u2014 we grieve with those who grieve. And we\u2019re saddened at the loss of life. But Hillary Clinton actually referred to that moment as an example of implicit bias in the police force, where \u2014 where she used \u2014 when she was asked in the debate a week ago whether there was implicit bias in law enforcement, her only answer was that there\u2019s implicit bias in everyone in the United States.

Our primary threat today is ISIS. And because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement that would have allowed some American combat troops to remain in Iraq and secure the hard fought gains the American soldier had won by 2009, ISIS was able to be literally conjured up out of the desert, and it\u2019s overrun vast areas that the American soldier had won in Operation Iraqi Freedom. My heart breaks for the likes of Lance Cpl. Scott Zubowski. He fell in Fallujah in 2005. He fought hard through some of the most difficult days in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and he paid the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedom and secure that nation. And that nation was secured in 2009. But because Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama failed to provide a status of forces agreement and leave sufficient troops in there, we are back at war. The president just ordered more troops on the ground. We are back at war in Iraq. And Scott Zubowski, whose mom would always come to Memorial Day events in Newcastle, Indiana, to see me, and I\u2019d always give her a hug and tell her we\u2019re never going to forget her son and we never will, Scott Zubowski and the sacrifices the American soldier made were squandered in Iraq because this administration created a vacuum in which ISIS was able to grow.

And the small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States to the point where all the United States of America \u2014 the greatest nation on Earth \u2014 just withdraws from talks about a cease-fire while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria while he marshals the forces and begins \u2014 look, we have got to begin to lean into this with strong, broad-shouldered American leadership. It begins by rebuilding our military. And the Russians and the Chinese have been making enormous investments in the military. We have the smallest Navy since 1916. We have the lowest number of troops since the end of the Second World War. We\u2019ve got to work with the Congress, and Donald Trump will, to rebuild our military and project American strength in the world. But about Aleppo and about Syria, I truly do believe that what America ought to do right now is immediately establish safe zones, so that families and vulnerable families with children can move out of those areas, work with our Arab partners, real time, right now, to make that happen. And secondly, I just have to tell you that the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength. And if Russia chooses to be involved and continue, I should say, to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo. There\u2019s a broad range of other things that we ought to do, as well. We ought to deploy a missile defense shield to the Czech Republic and Poland which Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama pulled back on out of not wanting to offend the Russians back in 2009."}

Thank you, Senator. This is a very challenging time in the life of our nation. Weakened America\u2019s place in the world after the leadership of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on the world stage has been followed by an economy that is truly struggling, stifled by an avalanche of more taxes, more regulation, Obamacare, the war on coal, and the kind of trade deals that have put American workers in the back seat. I think the best way that we can bring people together is through change in Washington, D.C. You know, I served in Washington, D.C., for 12 years in the Congress of the United States. And I served with many Republicans and Democrats, men and women of goodwill. The potential is there to really change the direction of this country, but it\u2019s going to take leadership to do it. The American people want to see our nation standing tall on the world stage again. They want to see us supporting our military, rebuilding our military, commanding the respect of the world, and they want to see the American economy off to the races again. They want to see an American comeback. And Donald Trump\u2019s entire career has been about building. It\u2019s been about \u2014 it\u2019s going through hardship just like a businessperson does and finding a way through smarts and ingenuity and resilience to fight forward and \u2014 when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, we\u2019re going to have a stronger America. When you hear him say he wants to make America great again, when we do that, I truly do believe the American people are going to be standing taller. They\u2019re going to see that real change can happen after decades of just talking about it. And when that happens, the American people are going to stand tall, stand together, and we\u2019ll have the kind of unity that\u2019s been missing for way too long."}

Are you a teacher? Yes, I think that that\u2019s a very good question, because I\u2019ve heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign. And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we\u2019re good. And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up. We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country. I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together. That\u2019s why the slogan of my campaign is \u201cStronger Together,\u201d because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals\u2014and I\u2019ve set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else. If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there\u2019s nothing in my opinion that America can\u2019t do. So that\u2019s why I hope that we will come together in this campaign. Obviously, I\u2019m hoping to earn your vote, I\u2019m hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American. I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion. I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that\u2019s, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve."}

I agree with everything she said. I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. This is a great country. This is a great land. I\u2019ve gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I\u2019ve been doing this as a politician. I cannot believe I\u2019m saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician. And my whole concept was to make America great again. When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what\u2019s happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it\u2019s a one-sided transaction where we\u2019re giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we\u2019ve made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago. When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it\u2019s in business and trade, where we\u2019re doing so badly. Last year, we had an almost $800 billion trade deficit. In other words, trading with other countries. We had an $800 billion deficit. It\u2019s hard to believe. Inconceivable. You say who\u2019s making these deals? We\u2019re going to make great trade deals. We\u2019re going to have a strong border. We\u2019re going to bring back law and order. Just today, policemen was shot, two killed. And this is happening on a weekly basis. We have to bring back respect to law enforcement. At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides. We need justice. But I want to do things that haven\u2019t been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it. It\u2019s called make America great again."}

You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve. Donald Trump is different. I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief. And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing. What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women. And he has said that the video doesn\u2019t represent who he is. But I think it\u2019s clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is. Because we\u2019ve seen this throughout the campaign. We have seen him insult women. We\u2019ve seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten. We\u2019ve seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter. We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms. So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is. But it\u2019s not only women, and it\u2019s not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African-Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others. So this is who Donald Trump is. And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are. That\u2019s why\u2014to go back to your question\u2014I want to send a message\u2014we all should\u2014to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity. These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love. And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I\u2019m so fortunate enough to become your president."}

I\u2019m going to help the African-Americans. I\u2019m going to help the Latinos, Hispanics. I am going to help the inner cities. She\u2019s done a terrible job for the African-Americans.

But that was something that happened. If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words, and his was action. His was what he\u2019s done to women. There\u2019s never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that\u2019s been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women. Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off, and she\u2019s seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight. So don\u2019t tell me about words. I am absolutely\u2014I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women. Paula Jones, who\u2019s also here tonight.

Instead of answering people\u2019s questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that\u2019s his choice. When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all - When they go low, you go high.  And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he\u2019s saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes for anything to anyone. He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq. And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion. He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn\u2019t be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, \u201cMexican.\u201d He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching. And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America. He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words."}

So you really owe him an apology. You\u2019re the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb. That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology. Number two, Michelle Obama. I\u2019ve gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And I\u2019ve gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I\u2019ve ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary. So, you talk about friend? Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion. And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they said about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance. And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil. But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing. And I\u2019ll tell you what. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d say this, but I\u2019m going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and we\u2019re going to have a special prosecutor. When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where e-mails\u2014and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process. So we\u2019re going to get a special prosecutor, and we\u2019re going to look into it, because you know what? People have been\u2014their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you\u2019ve done. And it\u2019s a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself."}

And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena. That wasn\u2019t before. That was after. She got it from the United States Congress. And I\u2019ll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen. Our Justice Department, where her husband goes onto the back of an airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case. But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself. What you did\u2014and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress."}

And I\u2019m going to fix it, because I agree with you. Premiums have gotten too high. Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I\u2019ve laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down. But here\u2019s what I don\u2019t want people to forget when we\u2019re talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn\u2019t just that 20 million people got insurance who didn\u2019t have it before. But that in and of itself was a good thing. I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families. But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employers got big benefits. Number one, insurance companies can\u2019t deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems. Number three, women can\u2019t be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act. Number four, if you\u2019re under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn\u2019t happen before. So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act. But we\u2019ve got to get costs down. We\u2019ve got to provide some additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance. But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange. And then we would have to start all over again. Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage. That\u2019s the highest we\u2019ve ever been in our country."}

Obamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it. It\u2019s going up at numbers that nobody\u2019s ever seen worldwide. Nobody\u2019s ever seen numbers like this for health care. It\u2019s only getting worse. In \u201917, it implodes by itself. Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money. We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt. Obamacare will never work. It\u2019s very bad, very bad health insurance. Far too expensive. And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. It\u2019s going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly. We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored. We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want\u2014and President Obama and whoever was working on it\u2014they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies. We want competition. You will have the finest health care plan there is. She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada. And if you haven\u2019t noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow. It\u2019s catastrophic in certain ways. But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything. Hillary Clinton has been after this for years. Obamacare was the first step. Obamacare is a total disaster. And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody\u2019s ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you\u2019re never going to be able to use it."}

That\u2019s where the vast majority of people get their health care. And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn\u2019t put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid. Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn\u2019t have the money to afford insurance and didn\u2019t have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them. That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take. And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance. So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald\u2019s not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies\u2026"}

I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem. And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it. As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people. Horribly wounded. They\u2019ll never be the same. Muslims have to report the problems when they see them. And, you know, there\u2019s always a reason for everything. If they don\u2019t do that, it\u2019s a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center. Go outside.

And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald. I want to say just a couple of things. First, we\u2019ve had Muslims in America since George Washington. And we\u2019ve had many successful Muslims. We just lost a particularly well-known one with Muhammad Ali. My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you\u2019re willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community. That\u2019s what America is. That\u2019s what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren. It\u2019s also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims. We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America. I\u2019ve met with a lot of them, and I\u2019ve heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that\u2019s what I want to see. It\u2019s also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations. Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans? And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists. We are not at war with Islam. And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are. So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else."}

This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time. We have enough problems in this country. I believe in building safe zones. I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people. But I don\u2019t want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them.

We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are. But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others. But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we\u2019re going to ban people based on a religion. How do you do that? We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty. How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county? Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country? And how do we expect to be able to implement those? So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous. And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorist sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us. And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he\u2019s denied being for the war in Iraq. We have it on tape. The entire press corps has looked at it.

Now she\u2019s blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln. That\u2019s one that I haven\u2019t\u2026 OK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied. That\u2019s the good thing. That\u2019s the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you. That\u2019s a big, big difference. We\u2019re talking about some difference. But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don\u2019t know Putin. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example. But I don\u2019t know Putin. But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are\u2014she doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they\u2019re trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia. I know\u2014I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia. I don\u2019t deal there. I have no businesses there. I have no loans from Russia. I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office. One of the primary things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet. But I have no loans with Russia. You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have. Now, the taxes are a very simple thing. As soon as I have\u2014first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. Many of her friends took bigger deductions. Warren Buffett took a massive deduction. Soros, who\u2019s a friend of hers, took a massive deduction. Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her\u2014took massive deductions. I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. But\u2014but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I\u2019ll release my returns. I\u2019ll be very proud to. They\u2019re actually quite great."}

One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code. And she could have done this years ago, by the way. She\u2019s a United States\u2014she was a United States senator. She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code. Well, why didn\u2019t she change it? Why didn\u2019t you change it when you were a senator? The reason you didn\u2019t is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do. And I do. You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change. But you wouldn\u2019t change it, because all of these people give you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump. But\u2014and I say that about a lot of things. You know, I\u2019ve heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years. \u201cI wish you would have done this.\u201d But she\u2019s been there for 30 years she\u2019s been doing this stuff. She never changed. And she never will change. She never will change. We\u2019re getting rid of carried interest provisions. I\u2019m lowering taxes actually, because I think it\u2019s so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving\u2014massive corporations and little ones, little ones can\u2019t form. We\u2019re getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes. But we\u2019re bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent. We\u2019re cutting taxes for the middle class. And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class. And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks. You can look at me. She\u2019s raising your taxes really high. And what that\u2019s going to do is a disaster for the country. But she is raising your taxes and I\u2019m lowering your taxes. That in itself is a big difference. We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. There\u2019s no growth. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it\u2019s like a national catastrophe. We\u2019re down at 1 percent. And that\u2019s, like, no growth. And we\u2019re going lower, in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world. And I\u2019m bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think it\u2019s so important\u2014one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybody\u2019s taxes massively."}

I\u2019m sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality. And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn\u2019t paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he\u2019s going to do. But I\u2019ll tell you what he\u2019s going to do. His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they\u2019ve ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two. Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift. And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families. Now, here\u2019s what I want to do. I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year\u2014and that\u2019s the vast majority of Americans as you know\u2014will have their taxes raised, because I think we\u2019ve got to go where the money is. And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code. And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes. I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes. I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars. It\u2019s called the Buffett rule. Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who\u2019s gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million. We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you. I want to invest in hard-working families. And I think it\u2019s been unfortunate, but it\u2019s happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top. And we need to reverse that. People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong."}

Hillary Clinton\u2014and it\u2019s extremely complex\u2014Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people. But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary\u2019s leaving. Very interesting why she\u2019s leaving carried interest. But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes. I absolutely used it.

Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system. After 9\/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it. Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done. When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women\u2019s rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons. Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years. I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.

And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left. And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime. Russia hasn\u2019t paid any attention to ISIS. They\u2019re interested in keeping Assad in power. So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones. We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them. And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground. But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia. Russia has decided that it\u2019s all in, in Syria. And they\u2019ve also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it\u2019s not me. I\u2019ve stood up to Russia. I\u2019ve taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president. I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that\u2019s fine. And I did as secretary of state. That\u2019s how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons. It\u2019s how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now. But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable."}

I don\u2019t think he would be listening to you very much anymore. Obama draws the line in the sand. It was laughed at all over the world what happened. Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia. But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they\u2019ve gone wild with their nuclear program. Not good. Our government shouldn\u2019t have allowed that to happen. Russia is new in terms of nuclear. We are old. We\u2019re tired. We\u2019re exhausted in terms of nuclear. A very bad thing. Now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad. She talks in favor of the rebels. She doesn\u2019t even know who the rebels are. You know, every time we take rebels, whether it\u2019s in Iraq or anywhere else, we\u2019re arming people. And you know what happens? They end up being worse than the people. Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi. Gadhafi\u2019s out. It\u2019s a mess. And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil. I\u2019m sure you probably have heard that. It was a disaster. Because the fact is, almost everything she\u2019s done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it\u2019s been a disaster. But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn\u2019t there, but possibly she\u2019s consulted. We sign a peace treaty. Everyone\u2019s all excited. Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I\u2019ve ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough cash to fill up this room. But look at that deal. Iran now and Russia are now against us. So she wants to fight. She wants to fight for rebels. There\u2019s only one problem. You don\u2019t even know who the rebels are.

There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this. And that takes a lot of planning and preparation. I would go after Baghdadi. I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders\u2014and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones\u2014made a difference. So I think that could help. I would also consider arming the Kurds. The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq. And I know there\u2019s a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq."}

Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world. Not in this country. It stripped us of manufacturing jobs. We lost our jobs. We lost our money. We lost our plants. It is a disaster. And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she\u2019s for it. She called it the gold standard.

She\u2019s been talking about it for years. As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens. She doesn\u2019t get it done. Same with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans. The same exact thing. They talk, they don\u2019t get it done. You go into the inner cities and\u2014you see it\u2019s 45 percent poverty. African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities.

I have worked with Latinos\u2014one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote.

And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected? You know, children listen to what is being said.

Well, you\u2019re right. This is one of the most important issues in this election. I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against. Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction. And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics. Donald doesn\u2019t agree with that. I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don\u2019t always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise. I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman\u2019s right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality. Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider. And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality. I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards. I want a Supreme Court that doesn\u2019t always side with corporate interests. I want a Supreme Court that understands because you\u2019re wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn\u2019t mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else. So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court. And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they\u2019ve not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices. I think that was a dereliction of duty. I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people."}

Why isn\u2019t she funding, not for $100 million, but why don\u2019t you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign? It\u2019s $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public. Why aren\u2019t you putting some money in?

I think it\u2019s such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration. Under absolutely siege. The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies. And foreign companies are now coming in buying our\u2014buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil. We are killing\u2014absolutely killing our energy business in this country. Now, I\u2019m all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera. But we need much more than wind and solar. And you look at our miners. Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business. There is a thing called clean coal. Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country. Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology. We have unbelievable\u2014we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet. So good. Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt. I will bring our energy companies back. They\u2019ll be able to compete. They\u2019ll make money. They\u2019ll pay off our national debt. They\u2019ll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous. But we are putting our energy companies out of business. We have to bring back our workers. You take a look at what\u2019s happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies. We have to guard our energy companies. We have to make it possible. The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business. And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they\u2019re doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business.

First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business. That\u2019s something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don\u2019t get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else. You know, because it sounds like you\u2019re in the business or you\u2019re aware of people in the business\u2014you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent. We are not dependent upon the Middle East. But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices. So the price of oil has been way down. And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right? We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels. And I think that\u2019s an important transition. We\u2019ve got to remain energy-independent. It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East. We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that. So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem. And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses. But I also want to be sure that we don\u2019t leave people behind. That\u2019s why I\u2019m the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out. A lot of them lost their lives. They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered our factories. I don\u2019t want to walk away from them.

And thanks to UNLV for hosting us. You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be? What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens? What kind of rights will Americans have? And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women\u2019s rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system. I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court. But I feel that at this point in our country\u2019s history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us. That\u2019s how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans. And I look forward to having that opportunity. I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them. That\u2019s the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate. The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process."}

The Supreme Court: It\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. Our country is so, so\u2014it\u2019s just so imperative that we have the right justices. Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent. And she was forced to apologize. And apologize she did. But these were statements that should never, ever have been made. We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege. I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don\u2019t think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now. But I feel that it\u2019s absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma. I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint\u2014and I\u2019ve named 20 of them\u2014the justices that I\u2019m going to appoint will be pro-life. They will have a conservative bent. They will be protecting the Second Amendment. They are great scholars in all cases, and they\u2019re people of tremendous respect. They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted. And I believe that\u2019s very, very important. I don\u2019t think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear. It\u2019s all about the Constitution of\u2014of\u2014and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be. And those are the people that I will appoint."}

I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years. I represented upstate New York. I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership. It goes back to the founding of our country. But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation. Because I support the Second Amendment doesn\u2019t mean that I want people who shouldn\u2019t have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family. And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns. I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole. There\u2019s other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment. You mentioned the Heller decision. And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them. And the court didn\u2019t accept that reasonable regulation, but they\u2019ve accepted many others. So I see no conflict between saving people\u2019s lives and defending the Second Amendment."}

And, you know, look, I understand that Donald\u2019s been strongly supported by the NRA. The gun lobby\u2019s on his side. They\u2019re running millions of dollars of ads against me. And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: of course we\u2019re going to protect and defend the Second Amendment.

And in this case, it\u2019s not only about Roe v. Wade. It is about what\u2019s happening right now in America. So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country. Donald has said he\u2019s in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood. He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood. I will defend Planned Parenthood. I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women\u2019s rights to make their own health care decisions."}

And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case. The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make. I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy. I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions. So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account."}

You know, I\u2019ve had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country. I\u2019ve been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania.

You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country. They\u2019re coming in illegally. Drugs are pouring in through the border. We have no country if we have no border. Hillary wants to give amnesty. She wants to have open borders. The border\u2014as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me. First time they\u2019ve ever endorsed a candidate. It means their job is tougher. But they know what\u2019s going on. They know it better than anybody. They want strong borders.

All of the problems\u2014the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border. It\u2019s just pouring and destroying their youth. It\u2019s poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people. We have to have strong borders. We have to keep the drugs out of our country.

They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life. And you\u2019re right. I don\u2019t want to rip families apart. I don\u2019t want to be sending parents away from children. I don\u2019t want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country. We have 11 million undocumented people. They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people. He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation. Now, here\u2019s what that means. It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented. And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country. I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation. I think it\u2019s an idea that would rip our country apart. I have been for border security for years. I voted for border security in the United States Senate. And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security. But I want to put our resources where I think they\u2019re most needed: Getting rid of any violent person. Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them. When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president. Didn\u2019t even raise it. He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we\u2019re not paying for that wall. So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with a path to citizenship."}

Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can\u2019t exploit them and undercut Americans\u2019 wages. And Donald knows a lot about this. He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower. He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do - \u201cYou complain, I\u2019ll get you deported.\u201d I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers."}

And what\u2019s really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans. They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions. Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet. This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election. So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past.

And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities. I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing. I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should. New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses. I want us to do more to help small business. That\u2019s where two-thirds of the new jobs are going to come from. I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not\u2014who work full-time should not still be in poverty. And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do. I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college. That\u2019s why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future. I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted. And we\u2019re going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is. Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top. So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share. We\u2019re going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country. That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs. By contrast, Donald\u2019s plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs. Why? Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids. So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities. The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession."}

Her tax plan is a disaster. And she can say all she wants about college tuition. And I\u2019m a big proponent. We\u2019re going to do a lot of things for college tuition. But the rest of the public\u2019s going to be paying for it. We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan. But I\u2019d like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I\u2019m\u2014not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries. Saudi Arabia, nothing but money. We protect Saudi Arabia. Why aren\u2019t they paying? She immediately\u2014when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO. Why aren\u2019t the NATO questioned\u2014why aren\u2019t they paying? Because they weren\u2019t paying. Since I did this\u2014this was a year ago\u2014all of a sudden, they\u2019re paying. And I\u2019ve been given a lot\u2014a lot of credit for it. All of a sudden, they\u2019re starting to pay up. They have to pay up. We\u2019re protecting people, they have to pay up. And I\u2019m a big fan of NATO. But they have to pay up. She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great. Well, it\u2019s awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are. We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out. We have, during his regime, during President Obama\u2019s regime, we\u2019ve doubled our national debt. We\u2019re up to $20 trillion. So my plan\u2014we\u2019re going to renegotiate trade deals. We\u2019re going to have a lot of free trade. We\u2019re going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now. But we have horrible deals. Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever. Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy. You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them. You go upstate New York. Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places. We\u2019re bringing our jobs back. I am going to renegotiate NAFTA. And if I can\u2019t make a great deal\u2014then we\u2019re going to terminate NAFTA and we\u2019re going to create new deals. We\u2019re going to have trade, but we\u2019re going\u2014we\u2019re going to terminate it, we\u2019re going to make a great trade deal. And if we can\u2019t, we\u2019re going to do it\u2014we\u2019re going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster. We are going to cut taxes massively.

I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less. I also will not add a penny to the debt. I have costed out what I\u2019m going to do. He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt. Well, he mentioned the debt. We know how to get control of the debt. When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt. When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression. He has cut the deficit by two-thirds. So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people. So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead. That\u2019s the kind of approach that will work."}

I\u2019ve never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy. I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy. He doesn\u2019t get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions. But it was a terrible recession. So now we\u2019ve dug ourselves out of it, we\u2019re standing, but we\u2019re not yet running. So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down. That is not going to work. That\u2019s why what I have put forward doesn\u2019t add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs. We\u2019re beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs. We\u2019ve got to do more to get the whole economy moving, and that\u2019s what I believe I will be able to do."}

Those people\u2014I don\u2019t know those people. I have a feeling how they came. I believe it was her campaign that did it. Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence? She\u2019s the one and Obama that caused the violence. They hired people\u2014they paid them $1,500, and they\u2019re on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things. I would say the only way\u2014because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that.

These women\u2014the woman on the plane, the\u2014I think they want either fame or her campaign did it. And I think it\u2019s her campaign. Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they\u2019re telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence. And I\u2019ll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot. And that was now all on tape, started by her. I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward. If it wasn\u2019t, they get their 10 minutes of fame. But they were all totally\u2014it was all fiction. It was lies, and it was fiction."}

So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women. That\u2019s who Donald is. I think it\u2019s really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don\u2019t want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.

What happened to the FBI, I don\u2019t know. We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI. One lie. She\u2019s lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI. He\u2019s going to probably go to jail. This is a four-star general.

So it\u2019s not one thing. This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies.

But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force. I don\u2019t think that is in our interest, and I don\u2019t think that would be smart to do. In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself. The goal here is to take back Mosul. It\u2019s going to be a hard fight. I\u2019ve got no illusions about that. And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters. I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real\u2014a really successful military operation. But we know we\u2019ve got lots of work to do. Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue.

That\u2019s why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don\u2019t let terrorists buy weapons. If you\u2019re too dangerous to fly, you\u2019re too dangerous to buy a gun. And I\u2019m going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track."}

We had Mosul. But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul. Now we\u2019re fighting again to get Mosul. The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul. About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they\u2019re going to attack Mosul. Whatever happened to the element of surprise, OK? We announce we\u2019re going after Mosul. I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about\u2014how long is it, Hillary, three months? These people have all left. They\u2019ve all left. The element of surprise. Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country. So we\u2019re now fighting for Mosul, that we had. All she had to do was stay there, and now we\u2019re going in to get it. But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it? And the only reason they did it is because she\u2019s running for the office of president and they want to look tough. They want to look good. He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all mistakes. That\u2019s why we have the great migration. But she wanted to look good for the election. So they\u2019re going in. But who\u2019s going to get Mosul, really? We\u2019ll take Mosul eventually. But the way\u2014if you look at what\u2019s happening, much tougher than they thought. Much, much tougher. Much more dangerous. Going to be more deaths that they thought. But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they\u2019re smart. They say, what do we need this for? So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing. And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid\u2014the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that\u2019s going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons. Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they\u2019ve wanted to do forever, but we\u2019ve made it so easy for them. So we\u2019re now going to take Mosul. And you know who\u2019s going to be the beneficiary? Iran. Oh, yeah, they\u2019re making\u2014I mean, they are outsmarting\u2014look, you\u2019re not there, you might be involved in that decision. But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq. You shouldn\u2019t have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it. You shouldn\u2019t have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way."}

But what\u2019s really important here is to understand all the interplay. Mosul is a Sunni city. Mosul is on the border of Syria. And, yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, and\u2014just like we went after bin Laden, while you were doing \u201cCelebrity Apprentice,\u201d and we brought him to justice. We need to go after the leadership. But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters. There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul. They\u2019ve been digging underground. They\u2019ve been prepared to defend. It\u2019s going to be tough fighting. But I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa. This is what we have to do. I\u2019m just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that\u2019s how Donald thinks.

And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what\u2019s happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she\u2019s going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama. And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago. He\u2014he aligned with Russia. He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful. We gave them $150 billion back. We give them $1.7 billion in cash. I mean, cash. Bundles of cash as big as this stage. We gave them $1.7 billion. Now they have\u2014he has aligned with Russia and with Iran.

I\u2019m well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general. This would not be done just on the first day. This would take a lot of negotiation. And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground. We\u2019ve had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated. So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS. But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees. He\u2019s made these claims repeatedly. I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in. But I am not going to slam the door on women and children. That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting. And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting. That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks. In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born. So let\u2019s be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it. And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we\u2019ve got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home."}

And if we do, you don\u2019t have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine. We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again. To do that, we\u2019re taking back jobs. We\u2019re not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don\u2019t make our product anymore. It\u2019s very sad.

But we don\u2019t use those people. Those are the people\u2014these are the greatest negotiators in the world. We have the greatest businesspeople in the world.

And before he rushes and says, \u201cYou know, before you and President Obama were there,\u201d I think it\u2019s important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades. You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world. He was criticizing President Reagan. This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, \u201cYou know, I alone can fix it,\u201d as he said on the convention stage. But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I\u2019m proposing. I do not add a penny to the national debt. I take that very seriously, because I do think it\u2019s one of the issues we\u2019ve got to come to grips with. So when I talk about how we\u2019re going to pay for education, how we\u2019re going to invest in infrastructure, how we\u2019re going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I\u2019ve made it very clear we are going where the money is. We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share. And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth. In fact, I think just the opposite. We\u2019ll have what economists call middle-out growth. We\u2019ve got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America. That\u2019s where growth will come from. That\u2019s why I want to invest in you. I want to invest in your family. And I think that\u2019s the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer.

And so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people. You know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Millions of jobs were lost, the auto industry was on the brink of collapse. The financial system had frozen up. And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, we\u2019ve begun to fight our way back. Over the last 30 months, we\u2019ve seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created. The auto industry has come roaring back. And housing has begun to rise. But we all know that we\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do. And so the question here tonight is not where we\u2019ve been, but where we\u2019re going. Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that we\u2019ll be better off. I\u2019ve got a different view. I think we\u2019ve got to invest in education and training. I think it\u2019s important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that we\u2019re helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States, that we take some of the money that we\u2019re saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments. Now, it ultimately is going to be up to the voters \u2014 to you \u2014 which path we should take. Are we going to double on top-down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best? And I\u2019m looking forward to having that debate."}

I\u2019m pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates. And congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary. I\u2019m sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine, here \u2014 here with me. So I\u2026 Congratulations. This is obviously a very tender topic. I\u2019ve had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country. I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm and she said, \u201cI\u2019ve been out of work since May. Can you help me?\u201d Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, \u201cAnn, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs. He\u2019s lost his most recent job and we\u2019ve now just lost our home. Can you help us?\u201d And the answer is, yes, we can help, but it\u2019s going to take a different path. Not the one we\u2019ve been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m going to do. My plan has five basic parts. One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent. That creates about 4 million jobs. Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America. Crack down on China, if and when they cheat. Number three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world. We\u2019re far away from that now. Number four, get to us a balanced budget. Number five, champion small business. It\u2019s small business that creates the jobs in America, and over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30-year low. Now, I\u2019m concerned that the path that we\u2019re on has just been unsuccessful. The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more \u2014 if you will, trickle-down government \u2014 would work. That\u2019s not the right answer for America. I\u2019ll restore the vitality that gets America working again. Thank you."}

MITT ROMNEY, R-MASS., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, PARTICIPATE IN A CANDIDATES DEBATE, UNIVERSITY OF DENVER, COLORADO","Date":1349222400000,"Participants":"FORMER GOV. MITT ROMNEY, R-MASS. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"JIM LEHRER","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do. First, we\u2019ve got to improve our education system and we\u2019ve made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools. We\u2019ve got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers. So now I want to hire another 100,000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now. And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people. When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent. But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States. On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we\u2019ve got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than they\u2019ve been in years. But I also believe that we\u2019ve got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments. So all of this is possible. Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code? And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments? And this is where there\u2019s a difference, because Governor Romney\u2019s central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut \u2014 on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts \u2014 that\u2019s another trillion dollars \u2014 and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn\u2019t asked for. That\u2019s $8 trillion. How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign."}

MITT ROMNEY, R-MASS., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, PARTICIPATE IN A CANDIDATES DEBATE, UNIVERSITY OF DENVER, COLORADO","Date":1349222400000,"Participants":"FORMER GOV. MITT ROMNEY, R-MASS. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"JIM LEHRER","Speaker":"ROMNEY","Text":"Well, sure. I\u2019d like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece. First of all, I don\u2019t have a $5 trillion tax cut. I don\u2019t have a tax cut of a scale that you\u2019re talking about. My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But I\u2019m not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people. High-income people are doing just fine in this economy. They\u2019ll do fine whether you\u2019re president or I am. The people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans. Under the president\u2019s policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. They\u2019re just being crushed. Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. This is a \u2014 this is a tax in and of itself. I\u2019ll call it the economy tax. It\u2019s been crushing. At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president. Electric rates are up. Food prices are up. Health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family. Middle-income families are being crushed. And so the question is how to get them going again. And I\u2019ve described it. It\u2019s energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business. Those are the \u2014 the cornerstones of my plan. But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I\u2019ll just note. First, education. I agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy. But our training programs right now, we\u2019ve got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. We\u2019ve got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them. The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down. And I do, both for corporations and for individuals. But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth. The third area, energy. Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up. But not due to his policies. In spite of his policies. Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half. If I\u2019m president, I\u2019ll double them, and also get the \u2014 the oil from offshore and Alaska. And I\u2019ll bring that pipeline in from Canada. And, by the way, I like coal. I\u2019m going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like it\u2019s getting crushed by your policies. I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs. And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, I\u2019m not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the \u2014 the revenues going to the government. My \u2014 my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit. But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans. And I \u2014 and to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans. So any \u2014 any language to the contrary is simply not accurate. LEHRER: Mr. President?"}

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"JIM LEHRER","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"Well, I think \u2014 let\u2019s talk about taxes, because I think it\u2019s instructive. Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families. And that\u2019s exactly what I did. We cut taxes for middle-class families by about $3,600. And the reason is, because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well. And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car. They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through. They can buy a computer for their kid who\u2019s going off to college, which means they\u2019re spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers. Now, Governor Romney\u2019s proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem is that he\u2019s been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasn\u2019t been able to identify them. But I\u2019m going to make an important point here, Jim."}

And that\u2019s why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romney\u2019s pledge of not reducing the deficit or \u2014 or \u2014 or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle-class families. The average middle-class family with children would pay about $2,000 more. Now, that\u2019s not my analysis. That\u2019s the analysis of economists who have looked at this. And \u2014 and that kind of top \u2014 top-down economics, where folks at the top are doing well, so the average person making $3 million is getting a $250,000 tax break, while middle-class families are burdened further, that\u2019s not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth."}

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"JIM LEHRER","Speaker":"ROMNEY","Text":"So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I\u2019d say absolutely not. I\u2019m not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut. What I\u2019ve said is I won\u2019t put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. That\u2019s part one. So there\u2019s no economist that can say Mitt Romney\u2019s tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan. Number two, I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals. I know that you and your running mate keep saying that and I know it\u2019s a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but it\u2019s just not the case. Look, I\u2019ve got five boys. I\u2019m used to people saying something that\u2019s not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I\u2019ll believe it. But that \u2014 that is not the case. All right? I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans. And number three, I will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middle-income families. I will lower taxes on middle-income families. Now, you cite a study. There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it\u2019s completely wrong. I saw a study that came out today that said you\u2019re going to raise taxes by $3,000 to $4,000 on middle-income families. There are all these studies out there. But let\u2019s get at the bottom line. That is, I want to bring down rates. I want to bring the rates down, at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need. And you\u2019d think, well, then why lower the rates? And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of America\u2019s workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate. And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people. For me, this is about jobs. This is about getting jobs for the American people."}
{"Title":"October 3, 2012 Debate Transcript","Debate":"PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA AND FORMER GOV. MITT ROMNEY, R-MASS., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, PARTICIPATE IN A CANDIDATES DEBATE, UNIVERSITY OF DENVER, COLORADO","Date":1349222400000,"Participants":"FORMER GOV. MITT ROMNEY, R-MASS. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"JIM LEHRER","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"Well, for 18 months he\u2019s been running on this tax plan. And now, five weeks before the election, he\u2019s saying that his big, bold idea is, \u201cNever mind.\u201d And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s math. It\u2019s arithmetic. Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth. So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times. And what I want to do is continue the tax rates \u2014 the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families. But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot. And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we\u2019re also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy. And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business. Under \u2014 under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they\u2019re the job creators, they\u2019d be burdened. But under Governor Romney\u2019s definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business. Now, I know Donald Trump doesn\u2019t like to think of himself as small anything, but \u2014 but that\u2019s how you define small businesses if you\u2019re getting business income. And that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow. And I think that would be a mistake."}

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"JIM LEHRER","Speaker":"ROMNEY","Text":"You bet. Well, President, you\u2019re \u2014 Mr. President, you\u2019re absolutely right, which is that, with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not \u2014 not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate, they\u2019re taxed at a lower rate. But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half \u2014 half of all the people who work in small business. Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America. And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent. Now, and \u2014 and I\u2019ve talked to a guy who has a very small business. He\u2019s in the electronics business in \u2014 in St. Louis. He has four employees. He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes, federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax. It added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned. And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent. The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs. I don\u2019t want to cost jobs. My priority is jobs. And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions, the same idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the way, get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions, to create more jobs, because there\u2019s nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes. That\u2019s by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced."}

If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for, $7 trillion \u2014 just to give you a sense, over 10 years, that\u2019s more than our entire defense budget \u2014 and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then Governor Romney\u2019s plan may work for you. But I think math, common sense, and our history shows us that\u2019s not a recipe for job growth. Look, we\u2019ve tried this. We\u2019ve tried both approaches. The approach that Governor Romney\u2019s talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Bill Clinton tried the approach that I\u2019m talking about. We created 23 million new jobs. We went from deficit to surplus. And businesses did very well. So, in some ways, we\u2019ve got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans and I believe that the economy works best when middle-class families are getting tax breaks so that they\u2019ve got some money in their pockets, and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure we\u2019re not blowing up the deficit."}

It\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 we\u2019ve got \u2014 when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before.

I think it\u2019s, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and they\u2019re going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives. And the amount of debt we\u2019re adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral. So how do we deal with it? Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit. One, of course, is to raise taxes. Number two is to cut spending. And number is to grow the economy, because if more people work in a growing economy, they\u2019re paying taxes, and you can get the job done that way. The presidents would \u2014 president would prefer raising taxes. I understand. The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth. And you could never quite get the job done. I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time. What things would I cut from spending?

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"JIM LEHRER","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me. And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis. And despite that, what we\u2019ve said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn\u2019t slip into a Great Depression, but what we\u2019ve also said is, let\u2019s make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow. So 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but weren\u2019t working very well, 18 government \u2014 18 government programs for education that were well-intentioned, not weren\u2019t helping kids learn, we went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars, $50 billion of waste taken out of the system. And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget. That\u2019s the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower. Now, we all know that we\u2019ve got to do more. And so I\u2019ve put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan. It\u2019s on a website. You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise. And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit. Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission. Well, that\u2019s how the commission \u2014 bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts. And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have. Let \u2014 let me just finish their point, because you\u2019re looking for contrast. You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue? And he said no. Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education. It means that Governor Romney\u2026 \u2026 talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities."}

I mean, you have said before you\u2019d cut the deficit in half. And this \u2014 I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts. You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year. That doesn\u2019t get the job done. Let me come back and say, why is it that I don\u2019t want to raise taxes? Why don\u2019t I want to raise taxes on people? And actually, you said it back in 2010. You said, \u201cLook, I\u2019m going to extend the tax policies that we have now; I\u2019m not going to raise taxes on anyone, because when the economy is growing slow like this, when we\u2019re in recession, you shouldn\u2019t raise taxes on anyone.\u201d Well, the economy is still growing slow. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement. And so if you believe the same thing, you just don\u2019t want to raise taxes on people. And the reality is it\u2019s not just wealthy people \u2014 you mentioned Donald Trump. It\u2019s not just Donald Trump you\u2019re taxing.

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"JIM LEHRER","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"If \u2014 if we\u2019re serious, we\u2019ve got to take a balanced, responsible approach. And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes. Let\u2019s talk about corporate taxes. Now, I\u2019ve identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually help the economy. The oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare. Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don\u2019t get. Now, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money, when they\u2019re making money every time you go to the pump? Why wouldn\u2019t we want to eliminate that? Why wouldn\u2019t we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets? My attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it. When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue neutral way, close loopholes, deductions \u2014 he hasn\u2019t identified which ones they are \u2014 but that thereby bring down the corporate rate. Well, I want to do the same thing, but I\u2019ve actually identified how we can do that. And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas. Right now, you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas. I think most Americans would say that doesn\u2019t make sense. And all that raises revenue. And so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college. It means that the teacher that I met in Las Vegas, a wonderful young lady, who describes to me \u2014 she\u2019s got 42 kids in her class. The first two weeks she\u2019s got them, some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned. They\u2019re using text books that are 10 years old. That is not a recipe for growth. That\u2019s not how America was built. And so budgets reflect choices. Ultimately, we\u2019re going to have to make some decisions. And if we\u2019re asking for no revenue, then that means that we\u2019ve got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff. And the magnitude of the tax cuts that you\u2019re talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow. As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we\u2019re talking about potentially a 30 \u2014 a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time. Now, you know, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is, you know, numbers on a sheet of paper, but if we\u2019re talking about a family who\u2019s got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid, that\u2019s a big problem. And governors are creative. There\u2019s no doubt about it. But they\u2019re not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid. What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help."}

Now, I like green energy as well, but that\u2019s about 50 years\u2019 worth of what oil and gas receives. And you say Exxon and Mobil. Actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth. But, you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table. Of course it\u2019s on the table. That\u2019s probably not going to survive you get that rate down to 25 percent. But don\u2019t forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years\u2019 worth of breaks, into \u2014 into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1.

I\u2019m not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you\u2019re going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you\u2019re going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best. And I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors \u2014 Republican and Democrats \u2014 said, please let us do that. We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor.

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"JIM LEHRER","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"You know, I suspect that, on Social Security, we\u2019ve got a somewhat similar position. Social Security is structurally sound. It\u2019s going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker \u2014 Democratic Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill. But it is \u2014 the basic structure is sound. But \u2014 but I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare, and then talk about Medicare, because that\u2019s the big driver of our deficits right now. You know, my grandmother \u2014 some of you know \u2014 helped to raise me. My grandparents did. My grandfather died a while back. My grandmother died three days before I was elected president. And she was fiercely independent. She worked her way up, only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank. And she ended up living alone by choice. And the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare. She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go. And that\u2019s the perspective I bring when I think about what\u2019s called entitlements. You know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks. These are folks who\u2019ve worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this. So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term? And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if we\u2019re going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, let\u2019s look where some of the money\u2019s going. $716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we weren\u2019t overpaying providers. And using that money, we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600, and we were also able to make a \u2014 make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the \u2014 throughout the system. So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs. When it comes to Social Security, as I said, you don\u2019t need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future."}

And the answer is neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare. So if you\u2019re 60 or around 60 or older, you don\u2019t need to listen any further. But for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring. Oh, I just thought about one. And that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the president isn\u2019t proposing any changes for current retirees. In fact he is on Medicare. On Social Security he\u2019s not. But on Medicare, for current retirees, he\u2019s cutting $716 billion from the program. Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers. Actually just going to them and saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody\u2019s going to get a lower rate.\u201d That\u2019s not just going after places where there\u2019s abuse. That\u2019s saying we\u2019re cutting the rates. Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won\u2019t take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario. We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won\u2019t take more Medicare patients. This \u2014 we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts. I can\u2019t understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare. Now, you point out, well, we\u2019re putting some back. We\u2019re going to give a better prescription program. That\u2019s $1 \u2014 that\u2019s $1 for every $15 you\u2019ve cut. They\u2019re smart enough to know that\u2019s not a good trade. I want to take that $716 billion you\u2019ve cut and put it back into Medicare. By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it. But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake. And with regards to young people coming along, I\u2019ve got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question."}

The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance. The problem is that because the voucher wouldn\u2019t necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year. Now, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is he\u2019ll maintain traditional Medicare alongside it. But there\u2019s still a problem, because what happens is, those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors. They recruit them, leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare. And every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, what\u2019ll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse. And then what you\u2019ve got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care. So, I don\u2019t think vouchers are the right way to go. And this is not my own \u2014 only my opinion. AARP thinks that the \u2014 the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years. Benefits were not affected at all. And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I have become fond of this term, \u201cObamacare,\u201d if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care. They\u2019re now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier. And the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they aren\u2019t making seniors any healthier. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term."}

That\u2019s not going to happen. They\u2019ll have at least two plans.

I know my own view is I\u2019d rather have a private plan. I\u2019d just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get. I\u2019d rather be able to have an insurance company. If I don\u2019t like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company. But people make their own choice. The other thing we have to do to save Medicare? We have to have the benefits high for those that are low income, but for higher income people, we\u2019re going to have to lower some of the benefits. We have to make sure this program is there for the long term. That\u2019s the plan that I\u2019ve put forward. And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or \u2014 or Senator Wyden, who\u2019s the co-author of the bill with \u2014 with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill \u2014 Bill Clinton\u2019s chief of staff. This is an idea that\u2019s been around a long time, which is saying, hey, let\u2019s see if we can\u2019t get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality. I believe in competition."}

And private insurers have to make a profit. Nothing wrong with that. That\u2019s what they do. And so you\u2019ve got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that. And if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney\u2019s proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere. And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies. And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they\u2019re stuck. And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially. And that\u2019s why they were supportive of the approach that we took. One last point I want to make.

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"JIM LEHRER","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"I think this is a great example. The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board. Now, it wasn\u2019t just on Wall Street. You had loan officers were \u2014 that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn\u2019t have been given, because the folks didn\u2019t qualify. You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn\u2019t afford. You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A1 great investments when they weren\u2019t. But you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didn\u2019t even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable. So what did we do? We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s. We said you\u2019ve got \u2014 banks, you\u2019ve got to raise your capital requirements. You can\u2019t engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk. We\u2019ve going to make sure that you\u2019ve got to have a living will so \u2014 so we can know how you\u2019re going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don\u2019t have other taxpayer bailouts. In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime, with interest. Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank. And, you know, I appreciate and it appears we\u2019ve got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation. But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back. And so the question is - Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street? Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate. But that\u2019s not what I believe."}

That\u2019s why I\u2019d have regulation. But I wouldn\u2019t designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check. That\u2019s one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank. It wasn\u2019t thought through properly. We need to get rid of that provision because it\u2019s killing regional and small banks. They\u2019re getting hurt. Let me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank. You say we were giving mortgages to people who weren\u2019t qualified. That\u2019s exactly right. It\u2019s one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had. And so Dodd-Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that\u2019s not qualified, there are big penalties, except they didn\u2019t ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was. It\u2019s been two years. We don\u2019t know what a qualified mortgage is yet. So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages. Try and get a mortgage these days. It\u2019s hurt the housing market because Dodd-Frank didn\u2019t anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have. It\u2019s not that Dodd-Frank always was wrong with too much regulation. Sometimes they didn\u2019t come out with a clear regulation. I will make sure we don\u2019t hurt the functioning of our \u2014 of our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs."}

A woman came to me and she said, look, I can\u2019t afford insurance for myself or my son. I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we\u2019re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can\u2019t afford it. And the number of small businesses I\u2019ve gone to that are saying they\u2019re dropping insurance because they can\u2019t afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive. And \u2014 and we\u2019ve got to deal with cost. And, unfortunately, when \u2014 when \u2014 when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance. So it\u2019s adding to cost. And as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500 a family. Instead, it\u2019s gone up by that amount. So it\u2019s expensive. Expensive things hurt families. So that\u2019s one reason I don\u2019t want it. Second reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it. I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors. Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that\u2019s going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have. I don\u2019t like that idea. Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country, said, what\u2019s been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans? And three-quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people. I just don\u2019t know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the \u2014 at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people. It has killed jobs. And the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state - craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state. And then let\u2019s focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium."}

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"JIM LEHRER","Speaker":"ROMNEY","Text":"Well, I did with my first statement. First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts. I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together. What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote. As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary \u2014 elected a Republican senator to stop Obamacare, you pushed it through anyway. So entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer and drove it through. What we did in a legislature 87 percent Democrat, we worked together; 200 legislators in my legislature, only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished. What were some differences? We didn\u2019t raise taxes. You\u2019ve raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare. We didn\u2019t cut Medicare. Of course, we don\u2019t have Medicare, but we didn\u2019t cut Medicare by $716 billion. We didn\u2019t put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they\u2019re going to receive. We didn\u2019t also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put \u2014 put people in a position where they\u2019re going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted. Right now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year. And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage. So for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance, this is why the American people don\u2019t want Medicare \u2014 don\u2019t want Obamacare. It\u2019s why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had \u2014 had the plan. They put a plan out. They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan. It was swept aside. I think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis. And we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties."}

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"JIM LEHRER","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis. This was a bipartisan idea. In fact, it was a Republican idea. And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation. And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it\u2019s the same plan. It \u2014 when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we\u2019ve created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall? Because there \u2014 there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis. One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that\u2019s been the trend line. Or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective? And there are ways of doing it. So at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average. And the reason they do is because they do some smart things. They \u2014 they say, if a patient\u2019s coming in, let\u2019s get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests. Let\u2019s make sure that we\u2019re providing preventive care so we\u2019re catching the onset of something like diabetes. Let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they\u2019ve \u2014 they\u2019ve engaged in. Now, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let\u2019s use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do. And the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we\u2019re going to be in a position to show that costs are going down. And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up \u2014 it\u2019s true \u2014 but they\u2019ve gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years. So we\u2019re already beginning to see progress. In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you\u2019re already getting a rebate. Let me make one last point. Governor Romney says, we should replace it, I\u2019m just going to repeal it, but \u2014 but we can replace it with something. But the problem is, he hasn\u2019t described what exactly we\u2019d replace it with, other than saying we\u2019re going to leave it to the states. But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he\u2019s offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there\u2019s no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who\u2019s got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance. In fact, it\u2019s estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you\u2019re looking at 50 million people losing health insurance\u2026"}

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"JIM LEHRER","Speaker":"ROMNEY","Text":"Well, actually it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a lengthy description. But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan. Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan. That\u2019s already offered in the private marketplace. You don\u2019t have to have the government mandate that for that to occur. But let\u2019s come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it\u2019s more affordable for families. And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have. In my opinion, the government is not effective in \u2014 in bringing down the cost of almost anything. As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be. Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe. This is the private market. These are small \u2014 these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs. I used to consult to businesses \u2014 excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers. I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people. In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don\u2019t need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have. We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that\u2019s happening. Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others. But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have. That\u2019s the wrong way to go. The private market and individual responsibility always work best."}

That\u2019s explicitly prohibited in the law. But let\u2019s go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions. Well, actually Governor, that isn\u2019t what your plan does. What your plan does is to duplicate what\u2019s already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can\u2019t deny you if you\u2019ve \u2014 if it\u2019s been under 90 days. But that\u2019s already the law and that doesn\u2019t help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions. There\u2019s a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts. It wasn\u2019t a government takeover of health care. It was the largest expansion of private insurance. But what it does say is that \u201cinsurers, you\u2019ve got to take everybody.\u201d Now, that also means that you\u2019ve got more customers. But when \u2014 when Governor Romney says that he\u2019ll replace it with something, but can\u2019t detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isn\u2019t a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem. It just reminds me of, you know, he says that he\u2019s going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan. That\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be paid for, but we don\u2019t know the details. He says that he\u2019s going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don\u2019t know exactly which ones. He won\u2019t tell us. He now says he\u2019s going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don\u2019t have to worry. And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they\u2019re too good? Is it \u2014 is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them? No. The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we\u2019ve got to make choices. And the choices we\u2019ve made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country."}

One way, for instance, would be to have a single number. Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000. Anybody can have deductions up to that amount. And then that number disappears for high-income people. That\u2019s one way one could do it. One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way. There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth. And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre-existing condition plan. You obviously studied up on \u2014 on my plan. In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions. That\u2019s part of my health care plan. And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state. And I said that at that time. The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy."}

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"JIM LEHRER","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe. That\u2019s its most basic function. And as commander-in-chief, that is something that I\u2019ve worked on and thought about every single day that I\u2019ve been in the Oval Office. But I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed. Look, the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions. But as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together. So, in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said, let\u2019s help to finance the Transcontinental Railroad, let\u2019s start the National Academy of Sciences, let\u2019s start land grant colleges, because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans, because if all Americans are getting opportunity, we\u2019re all going to be better off. That doesn\u2019t restrict people\u2019s freedom. That enhances it. And so what I\u2019ve tried to do as president is to apply those same principles. And when it comes to education what I\u2019ve said is we\u2019ve got to reform schools that are not working. We use something called Race to the Top. Wasn\u2019t a top-down approach, Governor. What we\u2019ve said is to states, we\u2019ll give you more money if you initiate reforms. And as a consequence, you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference. But what I\u2019ve also said is let\u2019s hire another 100,000 math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed. And hard-pressed states right now can\u2019t all do that. In fact we\u2019ve seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesn\u2019t think we need more teachers. I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help. It can\u2019t do it all, but it can make a difference. And as a consequence we\u2019ll have a better trained workforce and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where we\u2019ve got a skilled workforce."}

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"JIM LEHRER","Speaker":"ROMNEY","Text":"Well, first, I love great schools. Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states. And the key to great schools, great teachers. So I reject the idea that I don\u2019t believe in great teachers or more teachers. Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own. The role of government - Look behind us. The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents. First, life and liberty. We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none. I do not believe in cutting our military. I believe in maintaining the strength of America\u2019s military. Second, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country. That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose. I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can\u2019t care for themselves are cared by \u2014 by one another. We\u2019re a nation that believes that we\u2019re all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled. We care for them. And we \u2014 we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens. But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals. And what we\u2019re seeing right now is, in my view, a \u2014 a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams. And it\u2019s not working. And the proof of that is 23 million people out of work. The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty. The proof of that is we\u2019ve gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps. The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can\u2019t find work."}

The federal government can get local and \u2014 and state schools to do a better job. My own view, by the way, is I\u2019ve added to that. I happen to believe, I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I \u2014 these are disabled kids or \u2014 or \u2014 or poor kids or \u2014 or lower-income kids, rather, I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice.

You know, his \u2014 his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney\u2019s talked about. And it wasn\u2019t very detailed. This seems to be a trend. But \u2014 but what it did do is to \u2014 if you extrapolated how much money we\u2019re talking about, you\u2019d look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent. When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now.

And people who are going through them know that there\u2019s a job waiting for them if they complete it. That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support. Let me just say one final example. When it comes to making college affordable, whether it\u2019s two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed. So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system. And we said, \u201cWhy not cut out the middleman?\u201d And as a consequence, what we\u2019ve been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans. And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference. Governor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that, you know, \u201cyou should borrow money from your parents to go to college,\u201d you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver, just don\u2019t have that option. And for us to be able to make sure that they\u2019ve got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids. It\u2019s how we\u2019re going to grow this economy over the long term."}

All right, I\u2019m not going to cut education funding. I don\u2019t have any plan to cut education funding and \u2014 and grants that go to people going to college. I\u2019m planning on (inaudible) to grow. So I\u2019m not planning on making changes there. But you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is. You put $90 billion into \u2014 into green jobs. And I \u2014 look, I\u2019m all in favor of green energy. $90 billion, that would have \u2014 that would have hired 2 million teachers. $90 billion. And these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business. A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns. Look, the right course for America\u2019s government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the economic player, picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world. The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective? How do we get schools to be more competitive? Let\u2019s grade them. I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a \u2014 to a school that he\u2019s being more successful. I don\u2019t want to cut our commitment to education. I wanted to make it more effective and efficient. And by the way, I\u2019ve had that experience. I don\u2019t just talk about it. I\u2019ve been there. Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation. This is not because I didn\u2019t have commitment to education.

But, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they\u2019re advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class. That\u2019s how we cut taxes for middle- class families and small businesses. That\u2019s how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasn\u2019t advancing that cause. That\u2019s how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world. That\u2019s how we repealed \u201cdon\u2019t ask\/don\u2019t tell.\u201d That\u2019s how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to wind down the war in Afghanistan.

Number two, what\u2019s important is occasionally you\u2019ve got to say no, to \u2014 to \u2014 to folks both in your own party and in the other party. And, you know, yes, have we had some fights between me and the Republicans when \u2014 when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of Wall Street?

And I want to thank the University of Denver. You know, four years ago, we were going through a major crisis. And yet my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished. And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she\u2019s gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn\u2019t lay off workers during a recession. The auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride, that they\u2019re helping to build America. And so the question now is how do we build on those strengths. And everything that I\u2019ve tried to do, and everything that I\u2019m now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing American energy or making sure that we\u2019re closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the United States, or closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allows us to invest in our future.

This is a \u2014 this is an important election and I\u2019m concerned about America. I\u2019m concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years. I \u2014 I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals. It\u2019s bigger than our respective parties. It\u2019s an election about the course of America. What kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children. And there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening, and over the course of this month we\u2019re going to have two more presidential debates and a vice presidential debate. We\u2019re talk about those two paths. But they lead in very different directions. And it\u2019s not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of where they go. You can look at the record. There\u2019s no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected you\u2019ll continue to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up. I\u2019ll get incomes up again. You\u2019ll see chronic unemployment. We\u2019ve had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent. If I\u2019m president I will create \u2014 help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes. If the president\u2019s reelected, Obamacare will be fully installed. In my view that\u2019s going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past. Many will lose it. You\u2019re going to see health premiums go up by some $2,500 per family. If I\u2019m elected we won\u2019t have Obama. We\u2019ll put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and we\u2019ll focus on getting the cost of health care down. If the president were to be reelected you\u2019re going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare. You\u2019ll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare Advantage. You\u2019ll have hospital and providers that\u2019ll no longer accept Medicare patients. I\u2019ll restore that $716 billion to Medicare. And finally, military. The president\u2019s reelected you\u2019ll see dramatic cuts to our military. The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating. I will not cut our commitment to our military. I will keep America strong and get America\u2019s middle class working again. Thank you, Jim."}

When you\u2019re looking at a president, Martha, it seems to me that you should take a look at his most important responsibility. That\u2019s caring for the national security of the country.

Governor Romney said that was a tragic mistake, we should have left 30,000 \u2014 he ended it. Governor Romney said that was a tragic mistake, we should have left 30,000 troops there. With regard to Afghanistan, he said he will end the war in 2014. Governor Romney said we should not set a date, number one. And number two, with regard to 2014, it depends. When it came to Osama bin Laden, the president the first day in office, I was sitting with him in the Oval Office, he called in the CIA and signed an order saying, \u201cMy highest priority is to get bin Laden.\u201d Prior to the election, prior to the \u2014 him being sworn in, Governor Romney was asked the question about how he would proceed.

And lastly, the president of the United States has \u2014 has led with a steady hand and clear vision. Governor Romney, the opposite. The last thing we need now is another war."}

So much for the embassy security piece. Number two, Governor Romney, before he knew the facts, before he even knew that our ambassador was killed, he was out making a political statement which was panned by the media around the world. And this talk about this \u2014 this weakness. I \u2014 I don\u2019t understand what my friend\u2019s talking about here. We \u2014 this is a president who\u2019s gone out and done everything he has said he was going to do. This is a guy who\u2019s repaired our alliances so the rest of the world follows us again.

Let\u2019s look at \u2014 let\u2019s take a look at the facts. Let\u2019s look at where we were when we came to office. The economy was in free fall. We had \u2014 the great recession hit; 9 million people lost their job; $1.7 \u2014 $1.6 trillion in wealth lost in equity in your homes, in retirement accounts for the middle class. We knew we had to act for the middle class. We immediately went out and rescued General Motors. We went ahead and made sure that we cut taxes for the middle class. And in addition to that, when that \u2014 when that occurred, what did Romney do? Romney said, \u201cNo, let Detroit go bankrupt.\u201d We moved in and helped people refinance their homes. Governor Romney said, \u201cNo, let foreclosures hit the bottom.\u201d But it shouldn\u2019t be surprising for a guy who says 47 percent of the American people are unwilling to take responsibility for their own lives. My friend recently in a speech in Washington said \u201c30 percent of the American people are takers.\u201d These people are my mom and dad \u2014 the people I grew up with, my neighbors. They pay more effective tax than Governor Romney pays in his federal income tax. They are elderly people who in fact are living off of Social Security. They are veterans and people fighting in Afghanistan right now who are, quote, \u201cnot paying any tax.\u201d I\u2019ve had it up to here with this notion that 47 percent \u2014 it\u2019s about time they take some responsibility here. And instead of signing pledges to Grover Norquist not to ask the wealthiest among us to contribute to bring back the middle class, they should be signing a pledge saying to the middle class we\u2019re going to level the playing field; we\u2019re going to give you a fair shot again; we are going to not repeat the mistakes we made in the past by having a different set of rules for Wall Street and Main Street, making sure that we continue to hemorrhage these tax cuts for the super wealthy. They\u2019re pushing the continuation of a tax cut that will give an additional $500 billion in tax cuts to 120,000 families. And they\u2019re holding hostage the middle class tax cut because they say we won\u2019t pass \u2014 we won\u2019t continue the middle class tax cut unless you give the tax cut for the super wealthy. It\u2019s about time they take some responsibility."}

Let me give you one concrete example. The continuation of the Bush tax cuts \u2014 we are arguing that the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy should be allowed to expire. Of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, $800 million \u2014 billion of that goes to people making a minimum of $1 million. We see no justification in these economic times for those, and they\u2019re patriotic Americans. They\u2019re not asking for this continued tax cut. They\u2019re not suggesting it, but my friends are insisting on it; 120,000 families by continuing that tax cut will get an additional $500 billion in tax relief in the next 10 years and their income is an average of $8 million. We want to extend permanently the middle-class tax cut for \u2014 permanently, from the Bush middle-class tax cut. These guys won\u2019t allow us to. You know what they\u2019re saying? We say \u201clet\u2019s have a vote \u2014 let\u2019s have a vote on the middle-class tax cut and let\u2019s have a vote on the upper (ph) tax cut; let\u2019s go ahead and vote on it.\u201d They\u2019re saying no. They\u2019re holding hostage the middle class tax cut to the super wealthy. And on top of that, they\u2019ve got another tax cut coming that\u2019s $5 trillion that all of the studies point out will in fact give another $250 million \u2014 yeah, $250,000 a year to those 120,000 families and raise taxes for people who are middle income with a child by $2,000 a year. This is unconscionable. There is no need for this. The middle class got knocked on their heels. The great recession crushed them. They need some help now.

Now, there\u2019s not enough \u2014 the reason why the AEI study, the American Enterprise Institute study, the Tax Policy Center study, the reason they all say it\u2019s going \u2014 taxes go up on the middle class, the only way you can find $5 trillion in loopholes is cut the mortgage deduction for middle-class people, cut the health care deduction, middle-class people, take away their ability to get a tax break to send their kids to college.

I\u2019ve been up in the Konar (ph) Valley. I\u2019ve been throughout that whole country, mostly in a helicopter, and sometimes in a vehicle. The fact is, we went there for one reason - to get those people who killed Americans, Al Qaida. We\u2019ve decimated Al Qaida central. We have eliminated Osama bin Laden. That was our purpose. And, in fact, in the meantime, what we said we would do, we would help train the Afghan military. It\u2019s their responsibility to take over their own security. That\u2019s why with 49 of our allies in Afghanistan, we\u2019ve agreed on a gradual drawdown so we\u2019re out of there by the year 20 \u2014 in the year 2014. My friend and the governor say it\u2019s based on conditions, which means it depends. It does not depend for us. It is the responsibility of the Afghans to take care of their own security. We have trained over 315,000, mostly without incident. There have been more than two dozen cases of green-on-blue where Americans have been killed. If we do not \u2014 if the measures the military has taken do not take hold, we will not go on joint patrols. We will not train in the field. We\u2019ll only train in the \u2014 in the Army bases that exist there. But we are leaving. We are leaving in 2014. Period. And in the process, we\u2019re going to be saving over the next 10 years another $800 billion. We\u2019ve been in this war for over a decade. The primary objective is almost completed. Now, all we\u2019re doing is putting the Kabul government in a position to be able to maintain their own security. It\u2019s their responsibility, not America\u2019s."}

With regard to \u2014 with regard to abortion, I accept my church\u2019s position on abortion as a \u2014 what we call a (inaudible) doctrine. Life begins at conception in the church\u2019s judgment. I accept it in my personal life. But I refuse to impose it on equally devout Christians and Muslims and Jews, and I just refuse to impose that on others, unlike my friend here, the \u2014 the congressman. I \u2014 I do not believe that we have a right to tell other people that \u2014 women they can\u2019t control their body. It\u2019s a decision between them and their doctor. In my view and the Supreme Court, I\u2019m not going to interfere with that. With regard to the assault on the Catholic church, let me make it absolutely clear, no religious institution, Catholic or otherwise, including Catholic Social Services, Georgetown Hospital, Mercy Hospital, any hospital, none has to either refer contraception, none has to pay for contraception, none has to be a vehicle to get contraception in any insurance policy they provide. That is a fact. That is a fact. Now with regard to the way in which the \u2014 we differ, my friend says that he \u2014 well I guess he accepts Governor Romney\u2019s position now, because in the past he has argued that there was \u2014 there\u2019s rape and forcible rape. He\u2019s argued that in the case of rape or incest, it was still \u2014 it would be a crime to engage in having an abortion. I just fundamentally disagree with my friend."}

He should not be thrown into a category of a 47 percent who don\u2019t pay their taxes while he was out there fighting and not having to pay taxes, and somehow not taking responsibility. I would also tell him that there are things that have occurred in this campaign and occur in every campaign that I\u2019m sure both of us regret anyone having said, particularly in these \u2014 these special new groups that can go out there, raise all the money they want, not have to identify themselves, who say the most scurrilous things about the other candidate. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s an abomination. But the bottom line here is I\u2019d ask that hero you referenced to take a look at whether or not Governor Romney or President Obama has the conviction to help lift up the middle class, restore them to where they were before this great recession hit and they got wiped out. Or whether or not he\u2019s going to continue to focus on taking care of only the very wealthy, not asking them to make \u2014 pay any part of the deal to bring \u2014 bring back the middle class and the economy of this country. I\u2019d ask him to take a look at whether the president of the United States has acted wisely in the use of force and whether or not the slipshod comments being made by my \u2014 my \u2014 or by Governor Romney serve \u2014 serve our interests very well.

I appreciate your \u2014 your question, and thank you for being here this evening and to all of those from Nassau County that have come, thank you for your time. Thank you to Hofstra University and to Candy Crowley for organizing and leading this \u2014 this event. Thank you, Mr. President, also for being part of this \u2014 this debate. Your question \u2014 your question is one that\u2019s being asked by college kids all over this country. I was in Pennsylvania with someone who had just graduated \u2014 this was in Philadelphia \u2014 and she said, \u201cI\u2019ve got my degree. I can\u2019t find a job. I\u2019ve got three part- time jobs. They\u2019re just barely enough to pay for my food and pay for an apartment. I can\u2019t begin to pay back my student loans.\u201d So what we have to do is two things. We have to make sure that we make it easier for kids to afford college. And also make sure that when they get out of college, there\u2019s a job. When I was governor of Massachusetts, to get a high school degree, you had to pass an exam. If you graduated in the top quarter of your airlines, we gave you a John and Abigail Adams scholarship, four years tuition free in the college of your choice in Massachusetts, it\u2019s a public institution. I want to make sure we keep our Pell grant program growing. We\u2019re also going to have our loan program, so that people are able to afford school. But the key thing is to make sure you can get a job when you get out of school. And what\u2019s happened over the last four years has been very, very hard for America\u2019s young people. I want you to be able to get a job. I know what it takes to get this economy going. With half of college kids graduating this year without a college \u2014 excuse me, without a job. And without a college level job, that\u2019s just unacceptable. And likewise you\u2019ve got more and more debt on your back. So more debt and less jobs. I\u2019m going to change that. I know what it takes to create good jobs again. I know what it takes to make sure that you have the kind of opportunity you deserve. And kids across this country are going to recognize, we\u2019re bringing back an economy. It\u2019s not going to be like the last four years. The middle-class has been crushed over the last four years, and jobs have been too scarce. I know what it takes to bring them back, and I\u2019m going to do that, and make sure that when you graduate \u2014 when do you graduate?"}

And the fact that you\u2019re making an investment in higher education is critical. Not just to you, but to the entire nation. Now, the most important thing we can do is to make sure that we are creating jobs in this country. But not just jobs, good paying jobs. Ones that can support a family. And what I want to do, is build on the five million jobs that we\u2019ve created over the last 30 months in the private sector alone. And there are a bunch of things we can do to make sure your future is bright. Number one, I want to build manufacturing jobs in this country again. Now when Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt. I said we\u2019re going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry and it\u2019s come surging back. I want to do that in industries, not just in Detroit, but all across the country and that means we change our tax code so we\u2019re giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the United States and creating jobs here. It also means we\u2019re helping them and small businesses to export all around the world to new markets. Number two, we\u2019ve got to make sure that we have the best education system in the world. And the fact that you\u2019re going to college is great, but I want everybody to get a great education and we\u2019ve worked hard to make sure that student loans are available for folks like you, but I also want to make sure that community colleges are offering slots for workers to get retrained for the jobs that are out there right now and the jobs of the future. Number three, we\u2019ve got to control our own energy. Now, not only oil and natural gas, which we\u2019ve been investing in; but also, we\u2019ve got to make sure we\u2019re building the energy source of the future, not just thinking about next year, but ten years from now, 20 years from now. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve invested in solar and wind and biofuels, energy efficient cars. We\u2019ve got to reduce our deficit, but we\u2019ve got to do it in a balanced way. Asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more along with cuts so that we can invest in education like yours. And let\u2019s take the money that we\u2019ve been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild America, roads, bridges schools. We do those things, not only is your future going to be bright but America\u2019s future is going to bright as well."}

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"CANDY CROWLEY","Speaker":"ROMNEY","Text":"Well what you\u2019re seeing in this country is 23 million people struggling to find a job. And a lot of them, as you say, Candy, have been out of work for a long, long, long time. The president\u2019s policies have been exercised over the last four years and they haven\u2019t put Americans back to work. We have fewer people working today than we had when the president took office. If the \u2014 the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent when he took office, it\u2019s 7.8 percent now. But if you calculated that unemployment rate, taking back the people who dropped out of the workforce, it would be 10.7 percent. We have not made the progress we need to make to put people back to work. That\u2019s why I put out a five-point plan that gets America 12 million new jobs in four years and rising take-home pay. It\u2019s going to help Jeremy get a job when he comes out of school. It\u2019s going to help people across the country that are unemployed right now. And one thing that the president said, which I want to make sure that we understand, he said that I said we should take Detroit bankrupt. And that\u2019s right. My plan was to have the company go through bankruptcy like 7-Eleven did and Macy\u2019s and Condell (ph) Airlines and come out stronger. And I know he keeps saying, you want to take Detroit bankrupt. Well, the president took Detroit bankrupt. You took General Motors bankrupt. You took Chrysler bankrupt. So when you say that I wanted to take the auto industry bankrupt, you actually did. And I think it\u2019s important to know that that was a process that was necessary to get those companies back on their feet, so they could start hiring more people. That was precisely what I recommended and ultimately what happened."}

But they\u2019ll tell you his prescription wasn\u2019t going to work. And Governor Romney\u2019s says he\u2019s got a five-point plan? Governor Romney doesn\u2019t have a five-point plan. He has a one-point plan. And that plan is to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules. That\u2019s been his philosophy in the private sector, that\u2019s been his philosophy as governor, that\u2019s been his philosophy as a presidential candidate. You can make a lot of money and pay lower tax rates than somebody who makes a lot less. You can ship jobs overseas and get tax breaks for it. You can invest in a company, bankrupt it, lay off the workers, strip away their pensions, and you still make money. That\u2019s exactly the philosophy that we\u2019ve seen in place for the last decade. That\u2019s what\u2019s been squeezing middle class families. And we have fought back for four years to get out of that mess. The last thing we need to do is to go back to the very same policies that got us there."}

So here\u2019s what I\u2019ve done since I\u2019ve been president. We have increased oil production to the highest levels in 16 years. Natural gas production is the highest it\u2019s been in decades. We have seen increases in coal production and coal employment. But what I\u2019ve also said is we can\u2019t just produce traditional source of energy. We\u2019ve also got to look to the future. That\u2019s why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars. That means that in the middle of the next decade, any car you buy, you\u2019re going to end up going twice as far on a gallon of gas. That\u2019s why we doubled clean \u2014 clean energy production like wind and solar and biofuels. And all these things have contributed to us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in 16 years. Now, I want to build on that. And that means, yes, we still continue to open up new areas for drilling. We continue to make it a priority for us to go after natural gas. We\u2019ve got potentially 600,000 jobs and 100 years worth of energy right beneath our feet with natural gas. And we can do it in an environmentally sound way. But we\u2019ve also got to continue to figure out how we have efficiency energy, because ultimately that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to reduce demand and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to keep gas prices lower. Now, Governor Romney will say he\u2019s got an all-of-the-above plan, but basically his plan is to let the oil companies write the energy policies. So he\u2019s got the oil and gas part, but he doesn\u2019t have the clean energy part. And if we are only thinking about tomorrow or the next day and not thinking about 10 years from now, we\u2019re not going to control our own economic future. Because China, Germany, they\u2019re making these investments. And I\u2019m not going to cede those jobs of the future to those countries. I expect those new energy sources to be built right here in the United States. That\u2019s going to help Jeremy get a job. It\u2019s also going to make sure that you\u2019re not paying as much for gas."}

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"CANDY CROWLEY","Speaker":"ROMNEY","Text":"Well, let\u2019s look at the president\u2019s policies, all right, as opposed to the rhetoric, because we\u2019ve had four years of policies being played out. And the president\u2019s right in terms of the additional oil production, but none of it came on federal land. As a matter of fact, oil production is down 14 percent this year on federal land, and gas production was down 9 percent. Why? Because the president cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands, and in federal waters. So where\u2019d the increase come from? Well a lot of it came from the Bakken Range in North Dakota. What was his participation there? The administration brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil, this massive new resource we have. And what was the cost? 20 or 25 birds were killed and brought out a migratory bird act to go after them on a criminal basis. Look, I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables. I believe very much in our renewable capabilities; ethanol, wind, solar will be an important part of our energy mix. But what we don\u2019t need is to have the president keeping us from taking advantage of oil, coal and gas. This has not been Mr. Oil, or Mr. Gas, or Mr. Coal. Talk to the people that are working in those industries. I was in coal country. People grabbed my arms and said, \u201cPlease save my job.\u201d The head of the EPA said, \u201cYou can\u2019t build a coal plant. You\u2019ll virtually \u2014 it\u2019s virtually impossible given our regulations.\u201d When the president ran for office, he said if you build a coal plant, you can go ahead, but you\u2019ll go bankrupt. That\u2019s not the right course for America. Let\u2019s take advantage of the energy resources we have, as well as the energy sources for the future. And if we do that, if we do what I\u2019m planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, North America energy independence within eight years, you\u2019re going to see manufacturing jobs come back. Because our energy is low cost, that are already beginning to come back because of our abundant energy. I\u2019ll get America and North America energy independent. I\u2019ll do it by more drilling, more permits and licenses. We\u2019re going to bring that pipeline in from Canada. How in the world the president said no to that pipeline? I will never know. This is about bringing good jobs back for the middle class of America, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. CROWLEY: Mr. President, let me just see if I can move you to the gist of this question, which is, are we looking at the new normal? I can tell you that tomorrow morning, a lot of people in Hempstead will wake up and fill up and they will find that the price of gas is over $4 a gallon. Is it within the purview of the government to bring those prices down, or are we looking at the new normal?"}

We\u2019re actually drilling more on public lands than in the previous administration and my \u2014 the previous president was an oil man. And natural gas isn\u2019t just appearing magically. We\u2019re encouraging it and working with the industry. And when I hear Governor Romney say he\u2019s a big coal guy, I mean, keep in mind, when \u2014 Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts, you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, \u201cThis plant kills,\u201d and took great pride in shutting it down. And now suddenly you\u2019re a big champion of coal. So what I\u2019ve tried to do is be consistent. With respect to something like coal, we made the largest investment in clean coal technology, to make sure that even as we\u2019re producing more coal, we\u2019re producing it cleaner and smarter. Same thing with oil, same thing with natural gas. And the proof is our oil imports are down to the lowest levels in 20 years. Oil production is up, natural gas production is up, and, most importantly, we\u2019re also starting to build cars that are more efficient. And that\u2019s creating jobs. That means those cars can be exported, \u2019cause that\u2019s the demand around the world, and it also means that it\u2019ll save money in your pocketbook. That\u2019s the strategy you need, an all-of-the-above strategy, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do in the next four years."}

If you\u2019re paying less than you paid a year or two ago, why, then, the strategy is working. But you\u2019re paying more. When the president took office, the price of gasoline here in Nassau County was about $1.86 a gallon. Now, it\u2019s $4.00 a gallon. The price of electricity is up. If the president\u2019s energy policies are working, you\u2019re going to see the cost of energy come down. I will fight to create more energy in this country, to get America energy secure.

Because the economy was on the verge of collapse, because we were about to go through the worst recession since the Great Depression, as a consequence of some of the same policies that Governor Romney\u2019s now promoting. So, it\u2019s conceivable that Governor Romney could bring down gas prices because with his policies, we might be back in that same mess. What I want to do is to create an economy that is strong, and at the same time produce energy. And with respect to this pipeline that Governor Romney keeps on talking about, we\u2019ve \u2014 we\u2019ve built enough pipeline to wrap around the entire earth once. So, I\u2019m all for pipelines. I\u2019m all for oil production. What I\u2019m not for is us ignoring the other half of the equation. So, for example, on wind energy, when Governor Romney says \u201cthese are imaginary jobs.\u201d When you\u2019ve got thousands of people right now in Iowa, right now in Colorado, who are working, creating wind power with good-paying manufacturing jobs, and the Republican senator in that \u2014 in Iowa is all for it, providing tax breaks (ph) to help this work and Governor Romney says I\u2019m opposed.

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"CANDY CROWLEY","Speaker":"ROMNEY","Text":"Thank you very much. And let me tell you, you\u2019re absolutely right about part of that, which is I want to bring the rates down, I want to simplify the tax code, and I want to get middle- income taxpayers to have lower taxes. And the reason I want middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes is because middle-income taxpayers have been buried over the past four years. You\u2019ve seen, as middle-income people in this country, incomes go down $4,300 a family, even as gasoline prices have gone up $2,000. Health insurance premiums, up $2,500. Food prices up. Utility prices up. The middle-income families in America have been crushed over the last four years. So I want to get some relief to middle-income families. That\u2019s part \u2014 that\u2019s part one. Now, how about deductions? \u2018Cause I\u2019m going to bring rates down across the board for everybody, but I\u2019m going to limit deductions and exemptions and credits, particularly for people at the high end, because I am not going to have people at the high end pay less than they\u2019re paying now. The top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation collects. So that\u2019ll stay the same. Middle-income people are going to get a tax break. And so, in terms of bringing down deductions, one way of doing that would be say everybody gets \u2014 I\u2019ll pick a number \u2014 $25,000 of deductions and credits, and you can decide which ones to use. Your home mortgage interest deduction, charity, child tax credit, and so forth, you can use those as part of filling that bucket, if you will, of deductions. But your rate comes down and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is every middle-income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains. No tax on your savings. That makes life a lot easier. If you\u2019re getting interest from a bank, if you\u2019re getting a statement from a mutual fund or any other kind of investment you have, you don\u2019t have to worry about filing taxes on that, because there\u2019ll be no taxes for anybody making $200,000.00 per year and less, on your interest, dividends and capital gains. Why am I lowering taxes on the middle-class? Because under the last four years, they\u2019ve been buried. And I want to help people in the middle-class. And I will not \u2014 I will not under any circumstances, reduce the share that\u2019s being paid by the highest income taxpayers. And I will not, under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle-class. The president\u2019s spending, the president\u2019s borrowing will cost this nation to have to raise taxes on the American people. Not just at the high end. A recent study has shown the people in the middle-class will see $4,000.00 per year in higher taxes as a result of the spending and borrowing of this administration. I will not let that happen. I want to get us on track to a balanced budget, and I\u2019m going to reduce the tax burden on middle income families. And what\u2019s that going to do? It\u2019s going to help those families, and it\u2019s going to create incentives to start growing jobs again in this country."}

MITT ROMNEY PARTICIPATE IN A CANDIDATES DEBATE, HOFSTRA UNIVERSITY, HEMPSTEAD, NEW YORK","Date":1350345600000,"Participants":"FORMER GOV. MITT ROMNEY, R-MASS. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"CANDY CROWLEY","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"My philosophy on taxes has been simple. And that is, I want to give middle-class families and folks who are striving to get into the middle-class some relief. Because they have been hit hard over the last decade. Over the last 15, over the last 20 years. So four years ago I stood on a stage just like this one. Actually it was a town hall, and I said I would cut taxes for middle- class families, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done, by $3,600.00. I said I would cut taxes for small businesses, who are the drivers and engines of growth. And we\u2019ve cut them 18 times. And I want to continue those tax cuts for middle-class families, and for small business. But what I\u2019ve also said is, if we\u2019re serious about reducing the deficit, if this is genuinely a moral obligation to the next generation, then in addition to some tough spending cuts, we\u2019ve also got to make sure that the wealthy do a little bit more. So what I\u2019ve said is, your first $250,000.00 worth of income, no change. And that means 98 percent of American families, 97 percent of small businesses, they will not see a tax increase. I\u2019m ready to sign that bill right now. The only reason it\u2019s not happening is because Governor Romney\u2019s allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent. But what I\u2019ve also says is for above $250,000, we can go back to the tax rates we had when Bill Clinton was president. We created 23 million new jobs. That\u2019s part of what took us from deficits to surplus. It will be good for our economy and it will be good for job creation. Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy. He was on 60 Minutes just two weeks ago and he was asked - Is it fair for somebody like you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody making $50,000 year? And he said, \u201cYes, I think that\u2019s fair.\u201d Not only that, he said, \u201cI think that\u2019s what grows the economy.\u201d Well, I fundamentally disagree with that. I think what grows the economy is when you get that tax credit that we put in place for your kids going to college. I think that grows the economy. I think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country. That grows our economy. So we just have a different theory. And when Governor Romney stands here, after a year of campaigning, when during a Republican primary he stood on stage and said \u201cI\u2019m going to give tax cuts\u201d \u2014 he didn\u2019t say tax rate cuts, he said \u201ctax cuts to everybody,\u201d including the top 1 percent, you should believe him because that\u2019s been his history. And that\u2019s exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that\u2019s striving for everybody."}

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"CANDY CROWLEY","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"No, it\u2019s not settled. Look, the cost of lowering rates for everybody across the board, 20 percent. Along with what he also wants to do in terms of eliminating the estate tax, along what he wants to do in terms of corporates, changes in the tax code, it costs about $5 trillion. Governor Romney then also wants to spend $2 trillion on additional military programs even though the military\u2019s not asking for them. That\u2019s $7 trillion. He also wants to continue the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. That\u2019s another trillion dollars \u2014 that\u2019s $8 trillion. Now, what he says is he\u2019s going to make sure that this doesn\u2019t add to the deficit and he\u2019s going to cut middleclass taxes. But when he\u2019s asked, how are you going to do it, which deductions, which loopholes are you going to close? He can\u2019t tell you. The \u2014 the fact that he only has to pay 14 percent on his taxes when a lot of you are paying much higher. He\u2019s already taken that off the board, capital gains are going to continue to be at a low rate so we \u2014 we\u2019re not going to get money that way. We haven\u2019t heard from the governor any specifics beyond Big Bird and eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood in terms of how he pays for that. Now, Governor Romney was a very successful investor. If somebody came to you, Governor, with a plan that said, here, I want to spend $7 or $8 trillion, and then we\u2019re going to pay for it, but we can\u2019t tell you until maybe after the election how we\u2019re going to do it, you wouldn\u2019t take such a sketchy deal and neither should you, the American people, because the math doesn\u2019t add up. And \u2014 and what\u2019s at stake here is one of two things, either Candy \u2014 this blows up the deficit because keep in mind, this is just to pay for the additional spending that he\u2019s talking about, $7 trillion \u2013 $8 trillion before we even get to the deficit we already have. Or, alternatively, it\u2019s got to be paid for, not only by closing deductions for wealthy individuals, that \u2014 that will pay for about 4 percent reduction in tax rates. You\u2019re going to be paying for it. You\u2019re going to lose some deductions, and you can\u2019t buy the sales pitch. Nobody who\u2019s looked at it that\u2019s serious, actually believes it adds up."}

When we\u2019re talking about math that doesn\u2019t add up, how about $4 trillion of deficits over the last four years, $5 trillion? That\u2019s math that doesn\u2019t add up. We have \u2014 we have a president talking about someone\u2019s plan in a way that\u2019s completely foreign to what my real plan is.

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"CANDY CROWLEY","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"Well, Katherine, that\u2019s a great question. And, you know, I was raised by a single mom who had to put herself through school while looking after two kids. And she worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we got everything we needed. My grandmother, she started off as a secretary in a bank. She never got a college education, even though she was smart as a whip. And she worked her way up to become a vice president of a local bank, but she hit the glass ceiling. She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career. She didn\u2019t complain. That\u2019s not what you did in that generation. And this is one of the reasons why one of the first \u2014 the first bill I signed was something called the Lily Ledbetter bill. And it\u2019s named after this amazing woman who had been doing the same job as a man for years, found out that she was getting paid less, and the Supreme Court said that she couldn\u2019t bring suit because she should have found about it earlier, whereas she had no way of finding out about it. So we fixed that. And that\u2019s an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family. This is not just a women\u2019s issue, this is a family issue, this is a middle-class issue, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to fight for it. It also means that we\u2019ve got to make sure that young people like yourself are able to afford a college education. Earlier, Governor Romney talked about he wants to make Pell Grants and other education accessible for young people. Well, the truth of the matter is, is that that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve expanded Pell Grants for millions of people, including millions of young women, all across the country. We did it by taking $60 billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, and we said, let\u2019s just cut out the middleman. Let\u2019s give the money directly to students. And as a consequence, we\u2019ve seen millions of young people be able to afford college, and that\u2019s going to make sure that young women are going to be able to compete in that marketplace. But we\u2019ve got to enforce the laws, which is what we are doing, and we\u2019ve also got to make sure that in every walk of life we do not tolerate discrimination. That\u2019s been one of the hallmarks of my administration. I\u2019m going to continue to push on this issue for the next four years."}

And I \u2014 and I went to my staff, and I said, \u201cHow come all the people for these jobs are \u2014 are all men.\u201d They said, \u201cWell, these are the people that have the qualifications.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, gosh, can\u2019t we \u2014 can\u2019t we find some \u2014 some women that are also qualified?\u201d And \u2014 and so we \u2014 we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet. I went to a number of women\u2019s groups and said, \u201cCan you help us find folks,\u201d and they brought us whole binders full of women. I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America. Now one of the reasons I was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort. But number two, because I recognized that if you\u2019re going to have women in the workforce that sometimes you need to be more flexible. My chief of staff, for instance, had two kids that were still in school. She said, I can\u2019t be here until 7 or 8 o\u2019clock at night. I need to be able to get home at 5 o\u2019clock so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school. So we said fine. Let\u2019s have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you. We\u2019re going to have to have employers in the new economy, in the economy I\u2019m going to bring to play, that are going to be so anxious to get good workers they\u2019re going to be anxious to hire women. In the \u2014 in the last women have lost 580,000 jobs. That\u2019s the net of what\u2019s happened in the last four years. We\u2019re still down 580,000 jobs. I mentioned 31\/2 million women, more now in poverty than four years ago. What we can do to help young women and women of all ages is to have a strong economy, so strong that employers that are looking to find good employees and bringing them into their workforce and adapting to a flexible work schedule that gives women opportunities that they would otherwise not be able to afford. This is what I have done. It\u2019s what I look forward to doing and I know what it takes to make an economy work, and I know what a working economy looks like. And an economy with 7.8 percent unemployment is not a real strong economy. An economy that has 23 million people looking for work is not a strong economy. An economy with 50 percent of kids graduating from college that can\u2019t finds a job, or a college level job, that\u2019s not what we have to have. CROWLEY: Governor? I\u2019m going to help women in America get good work by getting a stronger economy and by supporting women in the workforce."}

He said, \u201cI\u2019ll get back to you.\u201d And that\u2019s not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy. Now, there are some other issues that have a bearing on how women succeed in the workplace. For example, their healthcare. You know a major difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making. I think that\u2019s a mistake. In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured. Because this is not just a \u2014 a health issue, it\u2019s an economic issue for women. It makes a difference. This is money out of that family\u2019s pocket. Governor Romney not only opposed it, he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage. That\u2019s not the kind of advocacy that women need. When Governor Romney says that we should eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, there are millions of women all across the country, who rely on Planned Parenthood for, not just contraceptive care, they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings. That\u2019s a pocketbook issue for women and families all across the country. And it makes a difference in terms of how well and effectively women are able to work. When we talk about child care, and the credits that we\u2019re providing. That makes a difference in whether they can go out there and \u2014 and earn a living for their family. These are not just women\u2019s issues. These are family issues. These are economic issues. And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same fair deal as men are."}

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"CANDY CROWLEY","Speaker":"ROMNEY","Text":"Let me come back and \u2014 and answer your question. President Bush and I are \u2014 are different people and these are different times and that\u2019s why my five point plan is so different than what he would have done. I mean for instance, we can now, by virtue of new technology actually get all the energy we need in North America without having to go to the \u2014 the Arabs or the Venezuelans or anyone else. That wasn\u2019t true in his time, that\u2019s why my policy starts with a very robust policy to get all that energy in North America \u2014 become energy secure. Number two, trade \u2014 I\u2019ll crack down on China, President Bush didn\u2019t. I\u2019m also going to dramatically expand trade in Latin America. It\u2019s been growing about 12 percent per year over a long period of time. I want to add more free trade agreements so we\u2019ll have more trade. Number three, I\u2019m going to get us to a balanced budget. President Bush didn\u2019t. President Obama was right, he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years. He was right, but then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four years. And his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large. So that\u2019s the next area I\u2019m different than President Bush. And then let\u2019s take the last one, championing small business. Our party has been focused too long. I came through small business. I understand how hard it is to start a small business. That\u2019s why everything I\u2019ll do is designed to help small businesses grow and add jobs. I want to keep their taxes down on small business. I want regulators to see their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it. And the thing I find the most troubling about Obama Care, well it\u2019s a long list, but one of the things I find most troubling is that when you go out and talk to small businesses and ask them what they think about it, they tell you it keeps them from hiring more people. My priority is jobs. I know how to make that happen. And President Bush has a very different path for a very different time. My path is designed in getting small businesses to grow and hire people."}

MITT ROMNEY PARTICIPATE IN A CANDIDATES DEBATE, HOFSTRA UNIVERSITY, HEMPSTEAD, NEW YORK","Date":1350345600000,"Participants":"FORMER GOV. MITT ROMNEY, R-MASS. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"CANDY CROWLEY","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"Well, first of all, I think it\u2019s important to tell you that we did come in during some tough times. We were losing 800,000 jobs a month when I started. But we had been digging our way out of policies that were misplaced and focused on the top doing very well and middle class folks not doing well. Now, we\u2019ve seen 30 consecutive \u2014 31 consecutive months of job growth; 5.2 million new jobs created. And the plans that I talked about will create even more. But when Governor Romney says that he has a very different economic plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan are tax cuts. That\u2019s what took us from surplus to deficit. When he talks about getting tough on China, keep in mind that Governor Romney invested in companies that were pioneers of outsourcing to China, and is currently investing in countries \u2014 in companies that are building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks. That\u2019s \u2014 Governor, you\u2019re the last person who\u2019s going to get tough on China. And what we\u2019ve done when it comes to trade is not only sign three trade deals to open up new markets, but we\u2019ve also set up a task force for trade that goes after anybody who is taking advantage of American workers or businesses and not creating a level playing field. We\u2019ve brought twice as many cases against unfair trading practices than the previous administration and we\u2019ve won every single one that\u2019s been decided. When I said that we had to make sure that China was not flooding our domestic market with cheap tires, Governor Romney said I was being protectionist; that it wouldn\u2019t be helpful to American workers. Well, in fact we saved 1,000 jobs. And that\u2019s the kind of tough trade actions that are required. But the last point I want to make is this. You know, there are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush. George Bush didn\u2019t propose turning Medicare into a voucher. George Bush embraced comprehensive immigration reform. He didn\u2019t call for self-deportation. George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, so there are differences between Governor Romney and George Bush, but they\u2019re not on economic policy. In some ways, he\u2019s gone to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy. And I think that\u2019s a mistake. That\u2019s not how we\u2019re going to move our economy forward."}

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"CANDY CROWLEY","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"Well, we\u2019ve gone through a tough four years. There\u2019s no doubt about it. But four years ago, I told the American people and I told you I would cut taxes for middle class families. And I did. I told you I\u2019d cut taxes for small businesses, and I have. I said that I\u2019d end the war in Iraq, and I did. I said we\u2019d refocus attention on those who actually attacked us on 9\/11, and we have gone after Al Qaeda\u2019s leadership like never before and Osama bin Laden is dead. I said that we would put in place health care reform to make sure that insurance companies can\u2019t jerk you around and if you don\u2019t have health insurance, that you\u2019d have a chance to get affordable insurance, and I have. I committed that I would rein in the excesses of Wall Street, and we passed the toughest Wall Street reforms since the 1930s. We\u2019ve created five million jobs, and gone from 800 jobs a month being lost, and we are making progress. We saved an auto industry that was on the brink of collapse. Now, does that mean you\u2019re not struggling? Absolutely not. A lot of us are. And that\u2019s why the plan that I\u2019ve put forward for manufacturing and education, and reducing our deficit in a sensible way, using the savings from ending wars, to rebuild America and putting people back to work. Making sure that we are controlling our own energy, but not only the energy of today, but also the energy of the future. All of those things will make a difference, so the point is the commitments I\u2019ve made, I\u2019ve kept. And those that I haven\u2019t been able to keep, it\u2019s not for lack of trying and we\u2019re going to get it done in a second term. But, you should pay attention to this campaign, because Governor Romney has made some commitments as well. And I suspect he\u2019ll keep those too. You know when members of the Republican Congress say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to sign a no tax pledge, so that we don\u2019t ask a dime for millionaires and billionaires to reduce our deficit so we can still invest in education, and helping kids go to college. He said, \u201cMe too.\u201d When they said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to cut Planned Parenthood funding.\u201d He said, \u201cMe too.\u201d When he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to repeal Obamacare. First thing I\u2019m going to do,\u201d despite the fact that it\u2019s the same health care plan that he passed in Massachusetts and is working well. He said, \u201cMe too.\u201d That is not the kind of leadership that you need, but you should expect that those are promises he\u2019s going to keep."}

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"CANDY CROWLEY","Speaker":"ROMNEY","Text":"I think you know better. I think you know that these last four years haven\u2019t been so good as the president just described and that you don\u2019t feel like your confident that the next four years are going to be much better either. I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what you\u2019re going to get. You\u2019re going to get a repeat of the last four years. We just can\u2019t afford four more years like the last four years. He said that by now we\u2019d have unemployment at 5.4 percent. The difference between where it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million Americans without work. I wasn\u2019t the one that said 5.4 percent. This was the president\u2019s plan. Didn\u2019t get there. He said he would have by now put forward a plan to reform Medicare and Social Security, because he pointed out they\u2019re on the road to bankruptcy. He would reform them. He\u2019d get that done. He hasn\u2019t even made a proposal on either one. He said in his first year he\u2019d put out an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges. Didn\u2019t even file it. This is a president who has not been able to do what he said he\u2019d do. He said that he\u2019d cut in half the deficit. He hasn\u2019t done that either. In fact, he doubled it. He said that by now middle-income families would have a reduction in their health insurance premiums by $2,500 a year. It\u2019s gone up by $2,500 a year. And if Obamacare is passed, or implemented \u2014 it\u2019s already been passed \u2014 if it\u2019s implemented fully, it\u2019ll be another $2,500 on top. The middle class is getting crushed under the policies of a president who has not understood what it takes to get the economy working again. He keeps saying, \u201cLook, I\u2019ve created 5 million jobs.\u201d That\u2019s after losing 5 million jobs. The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country. The unemployment, the number of people who are still looking for work, is still 23 million Americans. There are more people in poverty, one out of six people in poverty. How about food stamps? When he took office, 32 million people were on food stamps. Today, 47 million people are on food stamps. How about the growth of the economy? It\u2019s growing more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before. The president wants to do well. I understand. But the policies he\u2019s put in place from Obamacare to Dodd-Frank to his tax policies to his regulatory policies, these policies combined have not let this economy take off and grow like it could have. You might say, \u201cWell, you got an example of one that worked better?\u201d Yeah, in the Reagan recession where unemployment hit 10.8 percent, between that period \u2014 the end of that recession and the equivalent of time to today, Ronald Reagan\u2019s recovery created twice as many jobs as this president\u2019s recovery. Five million jobs doesn\u2019t even keep up with our population growth. And the only reason the unemployment rate seems a little lower today is because of all the people that have dropped out of the workforce. The president has tried, but his policies haven\u2019t worked. He\u2019s great as a \u2014 as a \u2014 as a speaker and describing his plans and his vision. That\u2019s wonderful, except we have a record to look at. And that record shows he just hasn\u2019t been able to cut the deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare and Social Security to preserve them, to get us the rising incomes we need. Median income is down $4,300 a family and 23 million Americans out of work. That\u2019s what this election is about. It\u2019s about who can get the middle class in this country a bright and prosperous future and assure our kids the kind of hope and optimism they deserve."}

And let me step back and tell you what I would like to do with our immigration policy broadly and include an answer to your question. But first of all, this is a nation of immigrants. We welcome people coming to this country as immigrants. My dad was born in Mexico of American parents; Ann\u2019s dad was born in Wales and is a first-generation American. We welcome legal immigrants into this country. I want our legal system to work better. I want it to be streamlined. I want it to be clearer. I don\u2019t think you have to \u2014 shouldn\u2019t have to hire a lawyer to figure out how to get into this country legally. I also think that we should give visas to people \u2014 green cards, rather, to people who graduate with skills that we need. People around the world with accredited degrees in science and math get a green card stapled to their diploma, come to the U.S. of A. We should make sure our legal system works. Number two, we\u2019re going to have to stop illegal immigration. There are 4 million people who are waiting in line to get here legally. Those who\u2019ve come here illegally take their place. So I will not grant amnesty to those who have come here illegally. What I will do is I\u2019ll put in place an employment verification system and make sure that employers that hire people who have come here illegally are sanctioned for doing so. I won\u2019t put in place magnets for people coming here illegally. So for instance, I would not give driver\u2019s licenses to those that have come here illegally as the president would. The kids of those that came here illegally, those kids, I think, should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United States and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident. Now when the president ran for office, he said that he\u2019d put in place, in his first year, a piece of legislation \u2014 he\u2019d file a bill in his first year that would reform our \u2014 our immigration system, protect legal immigration, stop illegal immigration. He didn\u2019t do it. He had a Democrat House, a Democrat Senate, super majority in both Houses. Why did he fail to even promote legislation that would have provided an answer for those that want to come legally and for those that are here illegally today? What\u2019s a question I think the \u2014 the president will have a chance to answer right now."}

I mean we\u2019re just a few miles away from Ellis Island. We all understand what this country has become because talent from all around the world wants to come here. People are willing to take risks. People who want to build on their dreams and make sure their kids have an even bigger dreams than they have. But we\u2019re also a nation of laws. So what I\u2019ve said is we need to fix a broken immigration system and I\u2019ve done everything that I can on my own and sought cooperation from Congress to make sure that we fix the system. The first thing we did was to streamline the legal immigration system, to reduce the backlog, make it easier, simpler and cheaper for people who are waiting in line, obeying the law to make sure that they can come here and contribute to our country and that\u2019s good for our economic growth. They\u2019ll start new businesses. They\u2019ll make things happen to create jobs here in the United States. Number two, we do have to deal with our border so we put more border patrol on the \u2014 any time in history and the flow of undocumented works across the border is actually lower than it\u2019s been in 40 years. What I\u2019ve also said is if we\u2019re going to go after folks who are here illegally, we should do it smartly and go after folks who are criminals, gang bangers, people who are hurting the community, not after students, not after folks who are here just because they\u2019re trying to figure out how to feed their families. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. And what I\u2019ve also said is for young people who come here, brought here often times by their parents. Had gone to school here, pledged allegiance to the flag. Think of this as their country. Understand themselves as Americans in every way except having papers. And we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done administratively. Now, Governor Romney just said, you know he wants to help those young people too, but during the Republican primary, he said, \u201cI will veto the DREAM Act\u201d, that would allow these young people to have access.\u201d His main strategy during the Republican primary was to say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to encourage self-deportation.\u201d Making life so miserable on folks that they\u2019ll leave. He called the Arizona law a model for the nation. Part of the Arizona law said that law enforcement officers could stop folks because they suspected maybe they looked like they might be undocumented workers and check their papers. You know what? If my daughter or yours looks to somebody like they\u2019re not a citizen, I don\u2019t want \u2014 I don\u2019t want to empower somebody like that. So, we can fix this system in a comprehensive way. And when Governor Romney says, the challenge is, \u201cWell Obama didn\u2019t try.\u201d That\u2019s not true. I have sat down with Democrats and Republicans at the beginning of my term. And I said, let\u2019s fix this system. Including Senators previously who had supported it on the Republican side. But it\u2019s very hard for Republican\u2019s in Congress to support comprehensive immigration reform, if their standard bearer has said that, this is not something I\u2019m interested in supporting."}

He said the standard bearer wasn\u2019t for it. I\u2019m glad you thought I was a standard bearer four years ago, but I wasn\u2019t. Four years ago you said in your first year you would file legislation. In his first year, I was just getting \u2014 licking my wounds from having been beaten by John McCain, all right. I was not the standard bearer. My \u2014 my view is that this president should have honored his promise to do as he said. Now, let me mention one other thing, and that is self-deportation says let people make their own choice. What I was saying is, we\u2019re not going to round up 12 million people, undocumented illegals, and take them out of the nation. Instead let people make their own choice. And if they \u2014 if they find that \u2014 that they can\u2019t get the benefits here that they want and they can\u2019t \u2014 and they can\u2019t find the job they want, then they\u2019ll make a decision to go a place where \u2014 where they have better opportunities. But I\u2019m not in favor of rounding up people and \u2014 and \u2014 and taking them out of this country. I am in favor, as the president has said, and I agree with him, which is that if people have committed crimes we got to get them out of this country. Let me mention something else the president said. It was a moment ago and I didn\u2019t get a chance to, when he was describing Chinese investments and so forth."}

And these aren\u2019t just representatives of the United States, they are my representatives. I send them there, oftentimes into harm\u2019s way. I know these folks and I know their families. So nobody is more concerned about their safety and security than I am. So as soon as we found out that the Benghazi consulate was being overrun, I was on the phone with my national security team and I gave them three instructions. Number one, beef up our security and procedures, not just in Libya, but at every embassy and consulate in the region. Number two, investigate exactly what happened, regardless of where the facts lead us, to make sure folks are held accountable and it doesn\u2019t happen again. And number three, we are going to find out who did this and we\u2019re going to hunt them down, because one of the things that I\u2019ve said throughout my presidency is when folks mess with Americans, we go after them. Now Governor Romney had a very different response. While we were still dealing with our diplomats being threatened, Governor Romney put out a press release, trying to make political points, and that\u2019s not how a commander in chief operates. You don\u2019t turn national security into a political issue. Certainly not right when it\u2019s happening. And people \u2014 not everybody agrees with some of the decisions I\u2019ve made. But when it comes to our national security, I mean what I say. I said I\u2019d end the war in Libya \u2014 in \u2014 in Iraq, and I did. I said that we\u2019d go after al-Qaeda and bin Laden, we have. I said we\u2019d transition out of Afghanistan, and start making sure that Afghans are responsible for their own security, that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. And when it comes to this issue, when I say that we are going to find out exactly what happened, everybody will be held accountable.

And \u2014 and I \u2014 I think the president just said correctly that the buck does stop at his desk and \u2014 and he takes responsibility for \u2014 for that \u2014 for the failure in providing those security resources, and \u2014 and those terrible things may well happen from time to time. I \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I feel very deeply sympathetic for the families of those who lost loved ones. And today there\u2019s a memorial service for one of those that was lost in this tragedy. We \u2014 we think of their families and care for them deeply. There were other issues associated with this \u2014 with this tragedy. There were many days that passed before we knew whether this was a spontaneous demonstration, or actually whether it was a terrorist attack. And there was no demonstration involved. It was a terrorist attack and it took a long time for that to be told to the American people. Whether there was some misleading, or instead whether we just didn\u2019t know what happened, you have to ask yourself why didn\u2019t we know five days later when the ambassador to the United Nations went on TV to say that this was a demonstration. How could we have not known? But I find more troubling than this, that on \u2014 on the day following the assassination of the United States ambassador, the first time that\u2019s happened since 1979, when \u2014 when we have four Americans killed there, when apparently we didn\u2019t know what happened, that the president, the day after that happened, flies to Las Vegas for a political fund-raiser, then the next day to Colorado for another event, other political event. I think these \u2014 these actions taken by a president and a leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even material significance in that you\u2019d hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses. We\u2019ve read their accounts now about what happened. It was very clear this was not a demonstration. This was an attack by terrorists. And this calls into question the president\u2019s whole policy in the Middle East. Look what\u2019s happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya. Consider the distance between ourselves and \u2014 and Israel, the president said that \u2014 that he was going to put daylight between us and Israel. We have Iran four years closer to a nuclear bomb. Syria \u2014 Syria\u2019s not just a tragedy of 30,000 civilians being killed by a military, but also a strategic \u2014 strategically significant player for America. The president\u2019s policies throughout the Middle East began with an apology tour and \u2014 and \u2014 and pursue a strategy of leading from behind, and this strategy is unraveling before our very eyes."}

We\u2019ve got a long tradition of hunting and sportsmen and people who want to make sure they can protect themselves. But there have been too many instances during the course of my presidency, where I\u2019ve had to comfort families who have lost somebody. Most recently out in Aurora. You know, just a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably about a month, I saw a mother, who I had met at the bedside of her son, who had been shot in that theater. And her son had been shot through the head. And we spent some time, and we said a prayer and, remarkably, about two months later, this young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable, good as new. But there were a lot of families who didn\u2019t have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands didn\u2019t survive. So my belief is that, (A), we have to enforce the laws we\u2019ve already got, make sure that we\u2019re keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill. We\u2019ve done a much better job in terms of background checks, but we\u2019ve got more to do when it comes to enforcement. But I also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters don\u2019t belong on our streets. And so what I\u2019m trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally. Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced. But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence. Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there\u2019s an awful lot of violence and they\u2019re not using AK-47s. They\u2019re using cheap hand guns. And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that our schools are working; that if there\u2019s violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control. And so what I want is a \u2014 is a comprehensive strategy. Part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. But part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur."}

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"CANDY CROWLEY","Speaker":"ROMNEY","Text":"Yeah, I\u2019m not in favor of new pieces of legislation on \u2014 on guns and taking guns away or making certain guns illegal. We, of course, don\u2019t want to have automatic weapons, and that\u2019s already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons. What I believe is we have to do, as the president mentioned towards the end of his remarks there, which is to make enormous efforts to enforce the gun laws that we have, and to change the culture of violence that we have. And you ask how \u2014 how are we going to do that? And there are a number of things. He mentioned good schools. I totally agree. We were able to drive our schools to be number one in the nation in my state. And I believe if we do a better job in education, we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll give people the \u2014 the hope and opportunity they deserve and perhaps less violence from that. But let me mention another thing. And that is parents. We need moms and dads, helping to raise kids. Wherever possible the \u2014 the benefit of having two parents in the home, and that\u2019s not always possible. A lot of great single moms, single dads. But gosh to tell our kids that before they have babies, they ought to think about getting married to someone, that\u2019s a great idea. Because if there\u2019s a two parent family, the prospect of living in poverty goes down dramatically. The opportunities that the child will \u2014 will be able to achieve increase dramatically. So we can make changes in the way our culture works to help bring people away from violence and give them opportunity, and bring them in the American system. The \u2014 the greatest failure we\u2019ve had with regards to \u2014 to gun violence in some respects is what \u2014 what is known as Fast and Furious. Which was a program under this administration, and how it worked exactly I think we don\u2019t know precisely, where thousands of automatic, and AK-47 type weapons were \u2014 were given to people that ultimately gave them to \u2014 to drug lords. They used those weapons against \u2014 against their own citizens and killed Americans with them. And this was a \u2014 this was a program of the government. For what purpose it was put in place, I can\u2019t imagine. But it\u2019s one of the great tragedies related to violence in our society which has occurred during this administration. Which I think the American people would like to understand fully, it\u2019s been investigated to a degree, but \u2014 but the administration has carried out executive privilege to prevent all of the information from coming out. I\u2019d like to understand who it was that did this, what the idea was behind it, why it led to the violence, thousands of guns going to Mexican drug lords. OBAMA: Candy?"}

And he said that the reason he changed his mind was, in part, because he was seeking the endorsement of the National Rifle Association. So that\u2019s on the record. But I think that one area we agree on is the important of parents and the importance of schools, because I do believe that if our young people have opportunity, then they are less likely to engage in these kinds of violent acts. We\u2019re not going to eliminate everybody who is mentally disturbed and we have got to make sure they don\u2019t get weapons. But we can make a difference in terms ensuring that every young person in America, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, have a chance to succeed. And, Candy, we haven\u2019t had a chance to talk about education much, but I think it is very important to understand that the reforms we\u2019ve put in place, working with 46 governors around the country, are seeing schools that are some of the ones that are the toughest for kids starting to succeed. We\u2019re starting to see gains in math and science. When it comes to community colleges, we are setting up programs, including with Nassau Community College, to retrain workers, including young people who may have dropped out of school but now are getting another chance, training them for the jobs that exist right now. And in fact, employers are looking for skilled workers. And so we\u2019re matching them up. Giving them access to higher education. As I said, we have made sure that millions of young people are able to get an education that they weren\u2019t able to get before. Now\u2026"}

The place where we\u2019ve seen manufacturing go has been China. China is now the largest manufacturer in the world. It used to be the United States of America. A lot of good people have lost jobs. A half a million manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last four years. That\u2019s total over the last four years. One of the reasons for that is that people think it\u2019s more attractive in some cases to go offshore than to stay here. We have made it less attractive for enterprises to stay here than to go offshore from time to time. What I will do as president is make sure it\u2019s more attractive to come to America again. This is the way we\u2019re going to create jobs in this country. It\u2019s not by trickle-down government, saying we\u2019re going to take more money from people and hire more government workers, raise more taxes, put in place more regulations. Trickle-down government has never worked here, has never worked anywhere. I want to make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for small business, for big business, to invest and grow in America. Now, we\u2019re going to have to make sure that as we trade with other nations that they play by the rules. And China hasn\u2019t. One of the reasons \u2014 or one of the ways they don\u2019t play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency. Because if they put their currency down low, that means their prices on their goods are low. And that makes them advantageous in the marketplace. We lose sales. And manufacturers here in the U.S. making the same products can\u2019t compete. China has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years. And the president has a regular opportunity to label them as a currency manipulator, but refuses to do so. On day one, I will label China a currency manipulator, which will allow me as president to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers. So we\u2019re going to make sure that people we trade with around the world play by the rules. But let me \u2014 let me not just stop there. Don\u2019t forget, what\u2019s key to bringing back jobs here is not just finding someone else to punish, and I\u2019m going to be strict with people who we trade with to make sure they \u2014 they follow the law and play by the rules, but it\u2019s also to make America the most attractive place in the world for businesses of all kinds. That\u2019s why I want to down the tax rates on small employers, big employers, so they want to be here. Canada\u2019s tax rate on companies is now 15 percent. Ours is 35 percent. So if you\u2019re starting a business, where would you rather start it? We have to be competitive if we\u2019re going to create more jobs here. Regulations have quadrupled. The rate of regulations quadrupled under this president. I talk to small businesses across the country. They say, \u201cWe feel like we\u2019re under attack from our own government.\u201d I want to make sure that regulators see their job as encouraging small business, not crushing it. And there\u2019s no question but that Obamacare has been an extraordinary deterrent to enterprises of all kinds hiring people. My priority is making sure that we get more people hired. If we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country, then you\u2019re going to see rising incomes again. The reason incomes are down is because unemployment is so high. I know what it takes to get this to happen, and my plan will do that, and one part of it is to make sure that we keep China playing by the rules."}

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"CANDY CROWLEY","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"OK. We need to create jobs here. And both Governor Romney and I agree actually that we should lower our corporate tax rate. It\u2019s too high. But there\u2019s a difference in terms of how we would do it. I want to close loopholes that allow companies to deduct expenses when they move to China; that allow them to profit offshore and not have to get taxed, so they have tax advantages offshore. All those changes in our tax code would make a difference. Now, Governor Romney actually wants to expand those tax breaks. One of his big ideas when it comes to corporate tax reform would be to say, if you invest overseas, you make profits overseas, you don\u2019t have to pay U.S. taxes. But, of course, if you\u2019re a small business or a mom-and-pop business or a big business starting up here, you\u2019ve got to pay even the reduced rate that Governor Romney\u2019s talking about. And it\u2019s estimated that that will create 800,000 new jobs. The problem is they\u2019ll be in china. Or India. Or Germany. That\u2019s not the way we\u2019re going to create jobs here. The way we\u2019re going to create jobs here is not just to change our tax code, but also to double our exports. And we are on pace to double our exports, one of the commitments I made when I was president. That\u2019s creating tens of thousands of jobs all across the country. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve kept on pushing trade deals, but trade deals that make sure that American workers and American businesses are getting a good deal. Now, Governor Romney talked about China, as I already indicated. In the private sector, Governor Romney\u2019s company invested in what were called pioneers of outsourcing. That\u2019s not my phrase. That\u2019s what reporters called it. And as far as currency manipulation, the currency has actually gone up 11 percent since I\u2019ve been president because we have pushed them hard. And we\u2019ve put unprecedented trade pressure on China. That\u2019s why exports have significantly increased under my presidency. That\u2019s going to help to create jobs here."}

There\u2019s even an Apple store in China that\u2019s a counterfeit Apple store, selling counterfeit goods. They hack into our computers. We will have to have people play on a fair basis, that\u2019s number one. Number two, we have to make America the most attractive place for entrepreneurs, for people who want to expand their business. That\u2019s what brings jobs in.

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"CANDY CROWLEY","Speaker":"ROMNEY","Text":"Thank you, and that\u2019s an opportunity for me, and I appreciate it. In the nature of a campaign, it seems that some campaigns are focused on attacking a person rather than prescribing their own future and the things they\u2019d like to do. In the course of that, I think the president\u2019s campaign has tried to characterize me as \u2014 as someone who\u2019s very different than who I am. I care about 100 percent of the American people. I want 100 percent of the American people to have a bright and prosperous future. I care about our kids. I understand what it takes to make a bright and prosperous future for America again. I spent my life in the private sector, not in government. I\u2019m a guy who wants to help with the experience I have, the American people. My \u2014 my passion probably flows from the fact that I believe in God. And I believe we\u2019re all children of the same God. I believe we have a responsibility to care for one another. I \u2014 I served as a missionary for my church. I served as a pastor in my congregation for about 10 years. I\u2019ve sat across the table from people who were out of work and worked with them to try and find new work or to help them through tough times. I went to the Olympics when they were in trouble to try and get them on track. And as governor of my state, I was able to get 100 percent of my people insured, all my kids, about 98 percent of the adults. I was able also to get our schools ranked number one in the nation, so 100 percent of our kids would have a bright opportunity for a future. I understand that I can get this country on track again. We don\u2019t have to settle for what we\u2019re going through. We don\u2019t have to settle for gasoline at four bucks. We don\u2019t have to settle for unemployment at a chronically high level. We don\u2019t have to settle for 47 million people on food stamps. We don\u2019t have to settle for 50 percent of kids coming out of college not able to get work. We don\u2019t have to settle for 23 million people struggling to find a good job. If I become president, I\u2019ll get America working again. I will get us on track to a balanced budget. The president hasn\u2019t. I will. I\u2019ll make sure we can reform Medicare and Social Security to preserve them for coming \u2014 coming generations. The president said he would. He didn\u2019t."}

That\u2019s not what I believe. I believe that the free enterprise system is the greatest engine of prosperity the world\u2019s ever known. I believe in self-reliance and individual initiative and risk takers being rewarded. But I also believe that everybody should have a fair shot and everybody should do their fair share and everybody should play by the same rules, because that\u2019s how our economy\u2019s grown. That\u2019s how we built the world\u2019s greatest middle class. And \u2014 and that is part of what\u2019s at stake in this election. There\u2019s a fundamentally different vision about how we move our country forward. I believe Governor Romney is a good man. Loves his family, cares about his faith. But I also believe that when he said behind closed doors that 47 percent of the country considered themselves victims who refuse personal responsibility, think about who he was talking about. Folks on Social Security who\u2019ve worked all their lives. Veterans who\u2019ve sacrificed for this country. Students who are out there trying to hopefully advance their own dreams, but also this country\u2019s dreams. Soldiers who are overseas fighting for us right now. People who are working hard every day, paying payroll tax, gas taxes, but don\u2019t make enough income. And I want to fight for them. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing for the last four years. Because if they succeed, I believe the country succeeds. When my grandfather fought in World War II and he came back and he got a G.I. Bill and that allowed him to go to college, that wasn\u2019t a handout. That was something that advanced the entire country. And I want to make sure that the next generation has those same opportunities. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking for your vote and that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking for another four years."}

MITT ROMNEY, R-MASS., PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"BOB SCHIEFFER","Speaker":"ROMNEY","Text":"Thank you, Bob. And thank you for agreeing to moderate this debate this evening. Thank you to Lynn University for welcoming us here. And Mr. President, it\u2019s good to be with you again. We were together at a humorous event a little earlier, and it\u2019s nice to maybe funny this time, not on purpose. We\u2019ll see what happens. This is obviously an area of great concern to the entire world, and to America in particular, which is to see a \u2014 a complete change in the \u2014 the structure and the \u2014 the environment in the Middle East. With the Arab Spring, came a great deal of hope that there would be a change towards more moderation, and opportunity for greater participation on the part of women in public life, and in economic life in the Middle East. But instead, we\u2019ve seen in nation after nation, a number of disturbing events. Of course we see in Syria, 30,000 civilians having been killed by the military there. We see in \u2014 in Libya, an attack apparently by, I think we know now, by terrorists of some kind against \u2014 against our people there, four people dead. Our hearts and \u2014 and minds go out to them. Mali has been taken over, the northern part of Mali by al-Qaeda type individuals. We have in \u2014 in Egypt, a Muslim Brotherhood president. And so what we\u2019re seeing is a pretty dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region. Of course the greatest threat of all is Iran, four years closer to a nuclear weapon. And \u2014 and we\u2019re going to have to recognize that we have to do as the president has done. I congratulate him on \u2014 on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in al-Qaeda. But we can\u2019t kill our way out of this mess. We\u2019re going to have to put in place a very comprehensive and robust strategy to help the \u2014 the world of Islam and other parts of the world, reject this radical violent extremism, which is \u2014 it\u2019s certainly not on the run. It\u2019s certainly not hiding. This is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries, and it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America, long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism."}

MITT ROMNEY, R-MASS., PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"BOB SCHIEFFER","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"Well, my first job as commander in chief, Bob, is to keep the American people safe. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done over the last four years. We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on those who actually killed us on 9\/11. And as a consequence, Al Qaeda\u2019s core leadership has been decimated. In addition, we\u2019re now able to transition out of Afghanistan in a responsible way, making sure that Afghans take responsibility for their own security. And that allows us also to rebuild alliances and make friends around the world to combat future threats. Now with respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last debate, when we received that phone call, I immediately made sure that, number one, that we did everything we could to secure those Americans who were still in harm\u2019s way; number two, that we would investigate exactly what happened, and number three, most importantly, that we would go after those who killed Americans and we would bring them to justice. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to do. But I think it\u2019s important to step back and think about what happened in Libya. Keep in mind that I and Americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to, without putting troops on the ground at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in Iraq, liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years. Got rid of a despot who had killed Americans and as a consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of Libyans after the events in Benghazi marching and saying America is our friend. We stand with them. Now that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of. And, you know, Governor Romney, I\u2019m glad that you agree that we have been successful in going after Al Qaida, but I have to tell you that, you know, your strategy previously has been one that has been all over the map and is not designed to keep Americans safe or to build on the opportunities that exist in the Middle East."}

But my strategy is broader than that. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s important, of course. But the key that we\u2019re going to have to pursue is a \u2014 is a pathway to get the Muslim world to be able to reject extremism on its own. We don\u2019t want another Iraq, we don\u2019t want another Afghanistan. That\u2019s not the right course for us. The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the \u2014 the people who are leaders of these various anti-American groups and these \u2014 these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world. And how do we do that? A group of Arab scholars came together, organized by the U.N., to look at how we can help the \u2014 the world reject these \u2014 these terrorists. And the answer they came up with was this: One, more economic development. We should key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investment, and that of our friends, we should coordinate it to make sure that we \u2014 we push back and give them more economic development. Number two, better education. Number three, gender equality. Number four, the rule of law. We have to help these nations create civil societies. But what\u2019s been happening over the last couple of years is, as we\u2019ve watched this tumult in the Middle East, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see Al Qaida rushing in, you see other jihadist groups rushing in. And \u2014 and they\u2019re throughout many nations in the Middle East. It\u2019s wonderful that Libya seems to be making some progress, despite this terrible tragedy. But next door, of course, we have Egypt. Libya\u2019s 6 million population; Egypt, 80 million population. We want \u2014 we want to make sure that we\u2019re seeing progress throughout the Middle East. With Mali now having North Mali taken over by Al Qaida; with Syria having Assad continuing to \u2014 to kill, to murder his own people, this is a region in tumult.

But Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s. You say that you\u2019re not interested in duplicating what happened in Iraq. But just a few weeks ago, you said you think we should have more troops in Iraq right now. And the \u2014 the challenge we have \u2014 I know you haven\u2019t been in a position to actually execute foreign policy \u2014 but every time you\u2019ve offered an opinion, you\u2019ve been wrong. You said we should have gone into Iraq, despite that fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction. You said that we should still have troops in Iraq to this day. You indicated that we shouldn\u2019t be passing nuclear treaties with Russia despite the fact that 71 senators, Democrats and Republicans, voted for it. You said that, first, we should not have a timeline in Afghanistan. Then you said we should. Now you say maybe or it depends, which means not only were you wrong, but you were also confusing in sending mixed messages both to our troops and our allies. So, what \u2014 what we need to do with respect to the Middle East is strong, steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map.

You just gave a speech a few weeks ago in which you said we should still have troops in Iraq. That is not a recipe for making sure that we are taking advantage of the opportunities and meeting the challenges of the Middle East. Now, it is absolutely true that we cannot just meet these challenges militarily. And so what I\u2019ve done throughout my presidency and will continue to do is, number one, make sure that these countries are supporting our counterterrorism efforts. Number two, make sure that they are standing by our interests in Israel\u2019s security, because it is a true friend and our greatest ally in the region. Number three, we do have to make sure that we\u2019re protecting religious minorities and women because these countries can\u2019t develop unless all the population, not just half of it, is developing. Number four, we do have to develop their economic \u2014 their economic capabilities. But number five, the other thing that we have to do is recognize that we can\u2019t continue to do nation building in these regions. Part of American leadership is making sure that we\u2019re doing nation building here at home. That will help us maintain the kind of American leadership that we need."}

We\u2019ve mobilized sanctions against that government. We have made sure that they are isolated. We have provided humanitarian assistance and we are helping the opposition organize, and we\u2019re particularly interested in making sure that we\u2019re mobilizing the moderate forces inside of Syria. But ultimately, Syrians are going to have to determine their own future. And so everything we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re doing in consultation with our partners in the region, including Israel which obviously has a huge interest in seeing what happens in Syria; coordinating with Turkey and other countries in the region that have a great interest in this. This \u2014 what we\u2019re seeing taking place in Syria is heartbreaking, and that\u2019s why we are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are helping the opposition. But we also have to recognize that, you know, for us to get more entangled militarily in Syria is a serious step, and we have to do so making absolutely certain that we know who we are helping; that we\u2019re not putting arms in the hands of folks who eventually could turn them against us or allies in the region. And I am confident that Assad\u2019s days are numbered. But what we can\u2019t do is to simply suggest that, as Governor Romney at times has suggested, that giving heavy weapons, for example, to the Syrian opposition is a simple proposition that would lead us to be safer over the long term.

MITT ROMNEY, R-MASS., PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"BOB SCHIEFFER","Speaker":"ROMNEY","Text":"Well, let\u2019s step back and talk about what\u2019s happening in Syria and how important it is. First of all, 30,000 people being killed by their government is a humanitarian disaster. Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly right now. Syria is Iran\u2019s only ally in the Arab world. It\u2019s their route to the sea. It\u2019s the route for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally, Israel. And so seeing Syria remove Assad is a very high priority for us. Number two, seeing a \u2014 a replacement government being responsible people is critical for us. And finally, we don\u2019t want to have military involvement there. We don\u2019t want to get drawn into a military conflict. And so the right course for us, is working through our partners and with our own resources, to identify responsible parties within Syria, organize them, bring them together in a \u2014 in a form of \u2014 if not government, a form of \u2014 of \u2014 of council that can take the lead in Syria. And then make sure they have the arms necessary to defend themselves. We do need to make sure that they don\u2019t have arms that get into the \u2014 the wrong hands. Those arms could be used to hurt us down the road. We need to make sure as well that we coordinate this effort with our allies, and particularly with \u2014 with Israel. But the Saudi\u2019s and the Qatari, and \u2014 and the Turks are all very concerned about this. They\u2019re willing to work with us. We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria, making sure that the \u2014 the insurgent there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed, are people who will be the responsible parties. Recognize \u2014 I believe that Assad must go. I believe he will go. But I believe \u2014 we want to make sure that we have the relationships of friendship with the people that take his place, steps that in the years to come we see Syria as a \u2014 as a friend, and Syria as a responsible party in the Middle East. This \u2014 this is a critical opportunity for America. And what I\u2019m afraid of is we\u2019ve watched over the past year or so, first the president saying, well we\u2019ll let the U.N. deal with it. And Assad \u2014 excuse me, Kofi Annan came in and said we\u2019re going to try to have a ceasefire. That didn\u2019t work. Then it went to the Russians and said, let\u2019s see if you can do something. We should be playing the leadership role there, not on the ground with military."}

But going back to Libya \u2014 because this is an example of how we make choices. When we went in to Libya, and we were able to immediately stop the massacre there, because of the unique circumstances and the coalition that we had helped to organize. We also had to make sure that Moammar Gadhafi didn\u2019t stay there. And to the governor\u2019s credit, you supported us going into Libya and the coalition that we organized. But when it came time to making sure that Gadhafi did not stay in power, that he was captured, Governor, your suggestion was that this was mission creep, that this was mission muddle. Imagine if we had pulled out at that point. You know, Moammar Gadhafi had more American blood on his hands than any individual other than Osama bin Laden. And so we were going to make sure that we finished the job. That\u2019s part of the reason why the Libyans stand with us. But we did so in a careful, thoughtful way, making certain that we knew who we were dealing with, that those forces of moderation on the ground were ones that we could work with, and we have to take the same kind of steady, thoughtful leadership when it comes to Syria. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing."}

As you hear from intelligence sources even today, the \u2014 the insurgents are highly disparate. They haven\u2019t come together. They haven\u2019t formed a unity group, a council of some kind.

The notion that we would have tanks run over those young people who were in Tahrir Square, that is not the kind of American leadership that John F. Kennedy talked about 50 years ago. But what I\u2019ve also said is that now that you have a democratically elected government in Egypt, that they have to make sure that they take responsibility for protecting religious minorities. And we have put significant pressure on them to make sure they\u2019re doing that; to recognize the rights of women, which is critical throughout the region. These countries can\u2019t develop if young women are not given the kind of education that they need. They have to abide by their treaty with Israel. That is a red line for us, because not only is Israel\u2019s security at stake, but our security is at stake if that unravels. They have to make sure that they\u2019re cooperating with us when it comes to counterterrorism. And we will help them with respect to developing their own economy, because ultimately what\u2019s going to make the Egyptian revolution successful for the people of Egypt, but also for the world, is if those young people who gathered there are seeing opportunities. Their aspirations are similar to young people\u2019s here. They want jobs, they want to be able to make sure their kids are going to a good school. They want to make sure that they have a roof over their heads and that they have the prospects of a better life in the future. And so one of the things that we\u2019ve been doing is, is, for example, organizing entrepreneurship conferences with these Egyptians to give them a sense of how they can start rebuilding their economy in a way that\u2019s noncorrupt, that\u2019s transparent. But what is also important for us to understand is, is that for America to be successful in this region there\u2019s some things that we\u2019re going to have to do here at home as well. You know, one of the challenges over the last decade is we\u2019ve done experiments in nation building in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and we\u2019ve neglected, for example, developing our own economy, our own energy sectors, our own education system. And it\u2019s very hard for us to project leadership around the world when we\u2019re not doing what we need to do\u2026"}

I felt that \u2014 I wish we\u2019d have had a better vision of the future. I wish that, looking back at the beginning of the president\u2019s term and even further back than that, that we\u2019d have recognized that there was a growing energy and passion for freedom in that part of the world, and that we would have worked more aggressively with our friend and with other friends in the region to have them make the transition towards a more representative form of government, such that it didn\u2019t explode in the way that it did. But once it exploded, I felt the same as the president did, which is these freedom voices and the streets of Egypt, where the people who were speaking of our principles and the President Mubarak had done things which were unimaginable and the idea of him crushing his people was not something that we could possibly support. Let me step back and talk about what I think our mission has to be in the Middle East and even more broadly, because our purpose is to make sure the world is more \u2014 is peaceful. We want a peaceful planet. We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know they\u2019re going to have a bright and prosperous future, not be at war. That\u2019s our purpose. And the mantle of leadership for the \u2014 promoting the principles of peace has fallen to America. We didn\u2019t ask for it. But it\u2019s an honor that we have it. But for us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong. And that begins with a strong economy here at home. Unfortunately, the economy is not stronger. When the \u2014 when the president of Iraq \u2014 excuse me, of Iran, Ahmadinejad, says that our debt makes us not a great country, that\u2019s a frightening thing. Former chief of the \u2014 Joint Chiefs of Staff said that \u2014 Admiral Mullen said that our debt is the biggest national security threat we face. This \u2014 we have weakened our economy. We need a strong economy. We need to have as well a strong military. Our military is second to none in the world. We\u2019re blessed with terrific soldiers, and extraordinary technology and intelligence. But the idea of a trillion dollar in cuts through sequestration and budget cuts to the military would change that. We need to have strong allies. Our association and connection with our allies is essential to America\u2019s strength. We\u2019re the great nation that has allies, 42 allies and friends around the world. And, finally, we have to stand by our principles. And if we\u2019re strong in each of those things, American influence will grow. But unfortunately, in nowhere in the world is America\u2019s influence will grow. But unfortunately, in \u2014 nowhere in the world is America\u2019s influence greater today than it was four years ago."}

And those principles include human rights, human dignity, free enterprise, freedom of expression, elections. Because when there are elections, people tend to vote for peace. They don\u2019t vote for war. So we want to promote those principles around the world. We recognize that there are places of conflict in the world. We want to end those conflicts to the extent humanly possible. But in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong. America must lead. And for that to happen, we have to strengthen our economy here at home. You can\u2019t have 23 million people struggling to get a job. You can\u2019t have an economy that over the last three years keeps slowing down its growth rate. You can\u2019t have kids coming out of college, half of them can\u2019t find a job today, or a job that\u2019s commensurate with their college degree. We have to get our economy going. And our military, we\u2019ve got to strengthen our military long-term. We don\u2019t know what the world is going to throw at us down the road. We \u2014 we make decisions today in the military that \u2014 that will confront challenges we can\u2019t imagine. In the 2000 debates, there was no mention of terrorism, for instance. And a year later, 9\/11 happened. So, we have to make decisions based upon uncertainty, and that means a strong military. I will not cut our military budget. We have to also stand by our allies. I \u2014 I think the tension that existed between Israel and the United States was very unfortunate. I think also that pulling our missile defense program out of Poland in the way we did was also unfortunate in terms of, if you will, disrupting the relationship in some ways that existed between us. And then, of course, with regards to standing for our principles, when \u2014 when the students took to the streets in Tehran and the people there protested, the Green Revolution occurred, for the president to be silent I thought was an enormous mistake. We have to stand for our principles, stand for our allies, stand for a strong military and stand for a stronger economy."}

And the world needs a strong America, and it is stronger now than when I came into office. Because we ended the war in Iraq, we were able to refocus our attention on not only the terrorist threat, but also beginning a transition process in Afghanistan. It also allowed us to refocus on alliances and relationships that had been neglected for a decade. And Governor Romney, our alliances have never been stronger, in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel, where we have unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation, including dealing with the Iranian threat. But what we also have been able to do is position ourselves so we can start rebuilding America, and that\u2019s what my plan does. Making sure that we\u2019re bringing manufacturing back to our shores so that we\u2019re creating jobs here, as we\u2019ve done with the auto industry, not rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas. Making sure that we\u2019ve got the best education system in the world, including retraining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow. Doing everything we can to control our own energy. We\u2019ve cut our oil imports to the lowest level in two decades because we\u2019ve developed oil and natural gas. But we also have to develop clean energy technologies that will allow us to cut our exports in half by 2020. That\u2019s the kind of leadership that we need to show. And we\u2019ve got to make sure that we reduce our deficit. Unfortunately, Governor Romney\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t do it. We\u2019ve got to do it in a responsible way by cutting out spending we don\u2019t need, but also asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more. That way we can invest in the research and technology that\u2019s always kept us at the cutting edge. Now, Governor Romney has taken a different approach throughout this campaign. Both at home and abroad, he has proposed wrong and reckless policies. He\u2019s praised George Bush as a good economic steward and Dick Cheney as somebody who\u2019s \u2014 who shows great wisdom and judgment.

We\u2019re 9 million jobs short of that. I will get America working again and see rising take-home pay again, and I\u2019ll do it with five simple steps. Number one, we are going to have North American energy independence. We\u2019re going to do it by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear and our renewables. Number two, we\u2019re going to increase our trade. Trade grows about 12 percent year. It doubles about every \u2014 every five or so years. We can do better than that, particularly in Latin America. The opportunities for us in Latin America we have just not taken advantage of fully. As a matter of fact, Latin America\u2019s economy is almost as big as the economy of China. We\u2019re all focused on China. Latin America is a huge opportunity for us \u2014 time zone, language opportunities. Number three, we\u2019re going to have to have training programs that work for our workers and schools that finally put the parents and the teachers and the kids first, and the teachers\u2019 unions going to have to go behind. And then we\u2019re going to have to get to a balanced budget. We can\u2019t expect entrepreneurs and businesses large and small to take their life savings or their company\u2019s money and invest in America if they think we\u2019re headed to the road to Greece. And that\u2019s where we\u2019re going right now unless we finally get off this spending and borrowing binge. And I\u2019ll get us on track to a balanced budget. And finally, number five, we\u2019ve got to champion small business. Small business is where jobs come from. Two-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses.

First of all, Governor Romney talks about small businesses. But, Governor, when you were in Massachusetts, small businesses development ranked about 48th, I think out of 50 states in Massachusetts, because the policies that you are promoting actually don\u2019t help small businesses. And the way you define small businesses includes folks at the very top. And they include you and me. That\u2019s not the kind of small business promotion we need. But let\u2019s take an example that we know is going to make a difference in the 21st century and that\u2019s our education policy. We didn\u2019t have a lot of chance to talk about this in the last debate. You know, under my leadership, what we\u2019ve done is reformed education, working with governors, 46 states. We\u2019ve seen progress and gains in schools that were having a terrible time. And they\u2019re starting to finally make progress. And what I now want to do is to hire more teachers, especially in math and science, because we know that we\u2019ve fallen behind when it comes to math and science. And those teachers can make a difference. Now, Governor Romney, when you were asked by teachers whether or not this would help the economy grow, you said this isn\u2019t going to help the economy grow. When you were asked about reduced class sizes, you said class sizes don\u2019t make a difference. But I tell you, if you talk to teachers, they will tell you it does make a difference. And if we\u2019ve got math teachers who are able to provide the kind of support that they need for our kids, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to determine whether or not the new businesses are created here. Companies are going to locate here depending on whether we\u2019ve got the most highly skilled workforce. And the kinds of budget proposals that you\u2019ve put forward, when we don\u2019t ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for education, that\u2019s undermining our long-term competitiveness. That is not good for America\u2019s position in the world, and the world notices."}

There are a number of things that sound good, but frankly, we just can\u2019t afford them. And that one doesn\u2019t sound good and it\u2019s not affordable. So I\u2019d get rid of that one from day one. To the extent humanly possible, we get that out. We take program after program that we don\u2019t absolutely have to have, and we get rid of them. Number two, we take some programs that we are doing to keep, like Medicaid, which is a program for the poor; we\u2019ll take that healthcare program for the poor and we give it to the states to run because states run these programs more efficiently. As a governor, I thought please, give me this program. I can run this more efficiently than the federal government and states, by the way, are proving it.

Look, Governor Romney\u2019s called for $5 trillion of tax cuts that he says he\u2019s going to pay for by closing deductions. Now, the math doesn\u2019t work, but he continues to claim that he\u2019s going to do it. He then wants to spend another $2 trillion on military spending that our military is not asking for. Now, keep in mind that our military spending has gone up every single year that I\u2019ve been in office. We spend more on our military than the next 10 countries combined; China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, you name it. The next 10. And what I did was work with our joint chiefs of staff to think about, what are we going to need in the future to make sure that we are safe? And that\u2019s the budget that we\u2019ve put forward. But, what you can\u2019t do is spend $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military is not asking for, $5 trillion on tax cuts. You say that you\u2019re going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions, without naming what those loopholes and deductions are. And then somehow you\u2019re also going to deal with the deficit that we\u2019ve already got. The math simply doesn\u2019t work. But when it comes to our military, what we have to think about is not, you know just budgets, we\u2019ve got to think about capabilities. We need to be thinking about cyber security. We need to be talking about space. That\u2019s exactly what our budget does, but it\u2019s driven by strategy. It\u2019s not driven by politics. It\u2019s not driven by members of Congress, and what they would like to see. It\u2019s driven by, what are we going to need to keep the American people safe? That\u2019s exactly what our budget does, and it also then allows us to reduce our deficit, which is a significant national security concern. Because we\u2019ve got to make sure that our economy is strong at home so that we can project military power overseas."}

The budget that we are talking about is not reducing our military spending. It is maintaining it. But I think Governor Romney maybe hasn\u2019t spent enough time looking at how our military works. You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916. Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military\u2019s changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines. And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we\u2019re counting slips. It\u2019s what are our capabilities. And so when I sit down with the Secretary of the Navy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we determine how are we going to be best able to meet all of our defense needs in a way that also keeps faith with our troops, that also makes sure that our veterans have the kind of support that they need when they come home. And that is not reflected in the kind of budget that you\u2019re putting forward because it just doesn\u2019t work."}

MITT ROMNEY, R-MASS., PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"BOB SCHIEFFER","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"I will stand with Israel if they are attacked. And this is the reason why, working with Israel, we have created the strongest military and intelligence cooperation between our two countries in history. In fact, this week we\u2019ll be carrying out the largest military exercise with Israel in history, this very week. But to the issue of Iran, as long as I\u2019m president of the United States Iran will not get a nuclear weapon. I made that clear when I came into office. We then organized the strongest coalition and the strongest sanctions against Iran in history, and it is crippling their economy. Their currency has dropped 80 percent. Their oil production has plunged to the lowest level since they were fighting a war with Iraq 20 years ago. So their economy is in a shambles. And the reason we did this is because a nuclear Iran is a threat to our national security, and it is a threat to Israel\u2019s national security. We cannot afford to have a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world. Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism. And for them to be able to provide nuclear technology to non-state actors, that\u2019s unacceptable. And they have said that they want to see Israel wiped off the map. So the work that we\u2019ve done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice. They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a United States president, me, who said we\u2019re not going to take any options off the table. The disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that, during the course of this campaign, he\u2019s often talked as if we should take premature military action. I think that would be a mistake, because when I\u2019ve sent young men and women into harm\u2019s way, I always understand that that is the last resort, not the first resort."}

MITT ROMNEY, R-MASS., PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"BOB SCHIEFFER","Speaker":"ROMNEY","Text":"Well, first of all, I want to underscore the same point the president mad,e which is that if I\u2019m President of the United States, when I\u2019m President of the United States, we will stand with Israel. And if Israel is attacked, we have their back, not just diplomatically, not just culturally, but militarily. That\u2019s number one. Number two, with regards to Iran and the threat of Iran, there\u2019s no question but that a nuclear Iran, a nuclear-capable Iran is unacceptable to America. It presents a threat not only to our friends but ultimately a threat to us to have Iran have nuclear material, nuclear weapons that could be used against us or used to be threatening to us. It is also essential for us to understand what our mission is in Iran, and that is to dissuade Iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means. And crippling sanctions are something I called for five years ago, when I was in Israel, speaking at the Herzliya Conference. I laid out seven steps, crippling sanctions were number one. And they do work. You\u2019re seeing it right now in the economy. It\u2019s absolutely the right thing to do, to have crippling sanctions. I would have put them in place earlier. But it\u2019s good that we have them. Number two, something I would add today is I would tighten those sanctions. I would say that ships that carry Iranian oil, can\u2019t come into our ports. I imagine the E.U. would agree with us as well. Not only ships couldn\u2019t, but I\u2019d say companies that are moving their oil can\u2019t, people who are trading in their oil can\u2019t. I would tighten those sanctions further. Secondly, I\u2019d take on diplomatic isolation efforts. I\u2019d make sure that Ahmadinejad is indicted under the Genocide Convention. His words amount to genocide incitation. I would indict him for it. I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world. The same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of South Africa. We need to increase pressure time, and time again on Iran because anything other than a \u2014 a \u2014 a solution to this, which says \u2014 which stops this \u2014 this nuclear folly of theirs, is unacceptable to America. And of course, a military action is the last resort. It is something one would only \u2013 only consider if all of the other avenues had been \u2014 had been tried to their full extent."}

But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been in place. Because they have the opportunity to reenter the community of nations, and we would welcome that. There \u2014 there are people in Iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world for a better life. And we hope that their leadership takes the right decision, but the deal we\u2019ll accept is they end their nuclear program. It\u2019s very straightforward. And I\u2019m glad that Governor Romney agrees with the steps that we\u2019re taking. You know, there have been times, Governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that you\u2019d do the same things we did, but you\u2019d say them louder and somehow that \u2014 that would make a difference. And it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking. It\u2019s meticulous. We started from the day we got into office. And the reason is was so important \u2014 and this is a testament to how we\u2019ve restored American credibility and strength around the world \u2014 is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like Russia and China. Because if it\u2019s just us that are imposing sanctions \u2014 we\u2019ve had sanctions in place a long time. It\u2019s because we got everybody to agree that Iran is seeing so much pressure. And we\u2019ve got to maintain that pressure. There is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established. They convince the international community they are not pursuing a nuclear program. There are inspections that are very intrusive. But over time, what they can do is regain credibility. In the meantime, though, we\u2019re not going to let up the pressure until we have clear evidence that that takes place. And one last thing \u2014 just \u2014 just to make this point. The clock is ticking. We\u2019re not going to allow Iran to perpetually engage in negotiations that lead nowhere. And I\u2019ve been very clear to them. You know, because of the intelligence coordination that we do with a range of countries, including Israel, we have a sense of when they would get breakout capacity, which means that we would not be able to intervene in time to stop their nuclear program. And that clock is ticking. And we\u2019re going to make sure that if they do not meet the demands of the international community, then we are going to take all options necessary to make sure they don\u2019t have a nuclear weapon."}

I think they saw weakness where they had expected to find American strength. And I say that because from the very beginning, the president in his campaign four years ago, said he would meet with all the world\u2019s worst actors in his first year, he\u2019d sit down with Chavez and Kim Jong-il, with Castro and President Ahmadinejad of Iran. And I think they looked and thought, well, that\u2019s an unusual honor to receive from the President of the United States. And then the president began what I have called an apology tour, of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America. I think they looked at that and saw weakness. Then when there were dissidents in the streets of Tehran, a Green Revolution, holding signs saying, is America with us, the president was silent. I think they noticed that as well. And I think that when the president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel, that they noticed that as well. All of these things suggested, I think, to the Iranian mullahs that, hey, you know, we can keep on pushing along here, we can keep talks going on, we\u2019re just going to keep on spinning centrifuges. Now there are some 10,000 centrifuges spinning uranium, preparing to create a nuclear threat to the United States and to the world. That\u2019s unacceptable for us, and it\u2019s essential for a president to show strength from the very beginning, to make it very clear what is acceptable and not acceptable. And an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to us. They must not develop nuclear capability. And the way to make sure they understand that is by having, from the very beginning, the tightest sanctions possible. They need to be tightened. Our diplomatic isolation needs to be tougher. We need to indict Ahmadinejad. We need to put the pressure on them as hard as we possibly can, because if we do that, we won\u2019t have to take the military action."}

And every fact checker and every reporter who\u2019s looked at it, Governor, has said this is not true. And when it comes to tightening sanctions, look, as I said before, we\u2019ve put in the toughest, most crippling sanctions ever. And the fact is, while we were coordinating an international coalition to make sure these sanctions were effective, you were still invested in a Chinese state oil company that was doing business with the Iranian oil sector. So I\u2019ll let the American people decide, judge, who\u2019s going to be more effective and more credible when it comes to imposing crippling sanctions. And with respect to our attitude about the Iranian revolution, I was very clear about the murderous activities that had taken place and that was contrary to international law and everything that civilized people stand for. And \u2014 and so the strength that we have shown in Iran is shown by the fact that we\u2019ve been able to mobilize the world. When I came into office, the world was divided. Iran was resurgent. Iran is at its weakest point, economically, strategically, militarily, then since \u2014 then in many years. And we are going to continue to keep the pressure on to make sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon.

Which is why as president, we funded an Iron Dome program to stop those missiles. So that\u2019s how I\u2019ve used my travels, when I travel to Israel and when I travel to the region. And the \u2014 the central question at this point is going to be: Who is going to be credible to all parties involved? And they can look at my track record, whether it\u2019s Iran sanctions, whether it\u2019s dealing with counterterrorism, whether it\u2019s supporting democracy, whether it\u2019s supporting women\u2019s rights, whether it\u2019s supporting religious minorities. And they can say that the President of the United States and the United States of America has stood on the right side of history. And that kind of credibility is precisely why we\u2019ve been able to show leadership on a wide range of issues facing the world right now."}

Look, I look at what\u2019s happening around the world, and i see Iran four years closer to a bomb. I see the Middle East with a rising tide of violence, chaos, tumult. I see jihadists continuing to spread, whether they\u2019re rising or just about the same level, hard to precisely measure, but it\u2019s clear they\u2019re there. They\u2019re very strong. I see Syria with 30,000 civilians dead, Assad still in power. I see our trade deficit with China, larger than it\u2019s \u2014 growing larger every year, as a matter of fact. I look around the world and I don\u2019t feel that you see North Korea, continuing to export their nuclear technology, Russia said they\u2019re not going to follow Nunn-Lugar any more. They\u2019re back away from a nuclear proliferation treaty that we had with them. I look around the world, I don\u2019t see our influence growing around the world. I see our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the president to deal with our economic challenges at home; in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way I think it ought to be; in part because of the \u2014 the \u2014 the turmoil with Israel.

I mean, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear program. But just a few years ago you said that\u2019s something you\u2019d never do. In the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in Afghanistan, now you\u2019re for it, although it depends. In the same way that you say you would have ended the war in Iraq, but recently gave a speech saying that we should have 20,000 more folks in there. The same way that you said that it was mission creep to go after Gadhafi. When it comes to going after Osama bin Laden, you said, well, any president would make that call. But when you were a candidate in 2008, as I was, and I said if I got bin Laden in our sights I would take that shot, you said we shouldn\u2019t move heaven and earth to get one man. And you said we should ask Pakistan for permission. And if we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him. And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him. You know, after we killed bin Laden I was at ground zero for a memorial and talked to a young women who was four years old when 9\/11 happened. And the last conversation she had with her father was him calling from the twin towers, saying \u201cPeyton (ph), I love you and I will always watch over you.\u201d And for the next decade, she was haunted by that conversation. And she said to me, \u201cYou know, by finally getting bin Laden, that brought some closure to me.\u201d And when we do things like that \u2014 when we bring those who have harmed us to justice, that sends a message to the world and it tells Peyton (ph) that we did not forget her father. And I make that point because that\u2019s the kind of clarity of leadership, and those decisions are not always popular. Those decisions generally \u2014 generally are not poll-tested. And even some in my own party, including my current vice president, had the same critique as you did. But what the American people understand is that I look at what we need to get done to keep the American people safe and to move our interests forward, and I make those decisions."}

The commanders and the generals there are on track to do so. We\u2019ve seen progress over the past several years. The surge has been successful and the training program is proceeding apace. There are now a large number of Afghan Security Forces, 350,000 that are ready to step in to provide security and we\u2019re going to be able to make that transition by the end of 2014. So our troops will come home at that point. I can tell you at the same time, that we will make sure that we look at what\u2019s happening in Pakistan, and recognize that what\u2019s happening in Pakistan is going to have a major impact on the success in Afghanistan. And I say that because I know a lot of people that feel like we should just brush our hands and walk away. And I don\u2019t mean you, Mr. President, but some people in the \u2014 in our nation feel that Pakistan is being nice to us, and that we should walk away fro mthem. But Pakistan is important to the region, to the world and to us, because Pakistan has 100 nuclear warheads and they\u2019re rushing to build a lot more. They\u2019ll have more than Great Britain sometime in the \u2014 in the relatively near future. They also have the Haqqani Network and the Taliban existent within their country. And so a Pakistan that falls apart, becomes a failed state, would be of extraordinary danger to Afghanistan and to us. And so we\u2019re going to have to remain helpful in encouraging Pakistan to move towards a more stable government and rebuild the relationship with us. And that means that our aid that we provide to Pakistan is going to have to be conditioned upon certain benchmarks being met. So for me, I look at this as both a need to help move Pakistan in the right direction, and also to get Afghanistan to be ready, and they will be ready by the end of 2014."}

We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on Afghanistan, and we did deliver a surge of troops. That was facilitated in part because we had ended the war in Iraq. And we are now in a position where we have met many of the objectives that got us there in the first place. Part of what had happened is we\u2019d forgotten why we had gone. We went because there were people who were responsible for 3,000 American deaths. And so we decimated Al Qaida\u2019s core leadership in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan. We then started to build up Afghan forces. And we\u2019re now in a position where we can transition out, because there\u2019s no reason why Americans should die when Afghans are perfectly capable of defending their own country. Now, that transition has to take place in a responsible fashion. We\u2019ve been there a long time, and we\u2019ve got to make sure that we and our coalition partners are pulling out responsibly and giving Afghans the capabilities that they need. But what I think the American people recognize is after a decade of war it\u2019s time to do some nation building here at home. And what we can now do is free up some resources, to, for example, put Americans back to work, especially our veterans, rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our schools, making sure that, you know, our veterans are getting the care that they need when it comes to post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, making sure that the certifications that they need for good jobs of the future are in place. You know, I was having lunch with some \u2014 a veteran in Minnesota who had been a medic dealing with the most extreme circumstances. When he came home and he wanted to become a nurse, he had to start from scratch. And what we\u2019ve said is let\u2019s change those certifications. The first lady has done great work with an organization called Joining Forces putting our veterans back to work. And as a consequence, veterans\u2019 unemployment is actually now lower than general population. It was higher when I came into office. So those are the kinds of things that we can now do because we\u2019re making that transition in Afghanistan."}

It\u2019s a nation that\u2019s not like \u2014 like others and it does not have a civilian leadership that is calling the shots there. You have the ISI, their intelligence organization, is probably the most powerful of the \u2014 of three branches there. Then you have the military and then you have the civilian government. This is a nation, which, if it falls apart, if it \u2014 if it becomes a failed state, there are nuclear weapons there and you\u2019ve got \u2014 you\u2019ve got terrorists there who could grab their \u2014 their hands onto those nuclear weapons. This is \u2014 this is an important part of the world for us. Pakistan is \u2014 is technically an ally, and they\u2019re not acting very much like an ally right now. But we have some work to do. And I \u2014 I don\u2019t blame the administration for the fact that the relationship with Pakistan is strained. We \u2014 we had to go into Pakistan. We had to go in there to get Osama bin Laden. That was the right thing to do. And \u2014 and that upset them, but obviously there was a great deal of anger even before that. But we\u2019re going to have to work with the \u2014 with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that they\u2019re on. And it\u2019s important for them. It\u2019s important for the nuclear weapons. It\u2019s important for the success of Afghanistan. Because inside Pakistan, you have a \u2014 a large group of Pashtun that are \u2014 that are Taliban. They\u2019re going to come rushing back in to Afghanistan when we go. And that\u2019s one of the reasons the Afghan Security Forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that. But it\u2019s important for us to recognize that we can\u2019t just walk away from Pakistan.

We created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan. And what we\u2019ve also done is engaged these governments in the kind of reforms that are actually going to make a difference in people\u2019s lives day to day, to make sure that their governments aren\u2019t corrupt, to make sure that they\u2019re treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown and to make sure that they\u2019ve got a free market system that works. So across the board, we are engaging them in building capacity in these countries. And we have stood on the side of democracy. One thing I think Americans should be proud of, when Tunisians began to protest, this nation \u2014 me, my administration \u2014 stood with them earlier than just about any country. In Egypt we stood on the side of democracy. In Libya we stood on the side of the people. And as a consequence, there\u2019s no doubt that attitudes about Americans have changed. But there are always going to be elements in these countries that potentially threaten the United States. And we want to shrink those groups and those networks and we can do that. But we\u2019re always also going to have to maintain vigilance when it comes to terrorist activities. The truth, though, is that Al Qaeda is much weaker than it was when I came into office. And they don\u2019t have the same capacities to attack the U.S. homeland and our allies as they did four years ago."}

We have to remain vigilant, as I just said. But with respect to China, China is both an adversary, but also a potential partner in the international community if it\u2019s following the rules. So my attitude coming into office was that we are going to insist that China plays by the same rules as everybody else. I know Americans had seen jobs being shipped overseas; businesses and workers not getting a level playing field when it came to trade. And that\u2019s the reason why I set up a trade task force to go after cheaters when it came to international trade. That\u2019s the reason why we have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the other \u2014 the previous administration had done in two terms. And we\u2019ve won just about every case that we\u2019ve filed, that has been decided. In fact, just recently steelworkers in Ohio and throughout the Midwest \u2014 Pennsylvania \u2014 are in a position now to sell steel to China because we won that case. We had a tire case in which they were flooding us with cheap domestic tires \u2014 or \u2014 or cheap Chinese tires. And we put a stop to it and as a consequence saved jobs throughout America. I have to say that Governor Romney criticized me for being too tough in that tire case; said this wouldn\u2019t be good for American workers and that it would be protectionist. But I tell you, those workers don\u2019t feel that way. They feel as if they had finally an administration who was going to take this issue seriously. Over the long term, in order for us to compete with China, we\u2019ve also got to make sure, though, that we\u2019re taking \u2014 taking care of business here at home. If we don\u2019t have the best education system in the world, if we don\u2019t continue to put money into research and technology that will allow us to create great businesses here in the United States, that\u2019s how we lose the competition. And, unfortunately, Governor Romney\u2019s budget and his proposals would not allow us to make those investments."}

It\u2019s not government investments that makes businesses grow and hire people. Let me also note that the greatest threat that the world faces, the greatest national security threat is a nuclear Iran. Let\u2019s talk about China. China has an interest that\u2019s very much like ours in one respect, and that is they want a stable world. They don\u2019t want war. They don\u2019t want to see protectionism. They don\u2019t want to see the world break out into \u2014 into various forms of chaos, because they have to \u2014 they have to manufacture goods and put people to work and they have about 20,000 \u2014 20 million, rather, people coming out of the farms every year coming into the cities, needing jobs. So they want the economy to work and the world to be free and open. And so we can be a partner with China. We don\u2019t have to be an adversary in any way, shape or form. We can work with them, we can collaborate with them, if they\u2019re willing to be responsible. Now, they look at us and say, Is it a good idea to be with America? How strong are we going to be? How strong is our economy? They look at the fact that we owe \u2019em a trillion dollars and owe other people $16 trillion in total, including that. They look at our \u2014 our decision to \u2014 to cut back on our military capabilities. A trillion dollars. The secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating. It\u2019s not my term, it\u2019s the president\u2019s own secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating. It\u2019s not my term, it\u2019s the president\u2019s own Secretary of Defense, called them devastating. They look at America\u2019s commitments around the world and they see what\u2019s happening, and they say, well, OK. Is America going to be strong? And the answer is, yes, if I\u2019m president, America will be very strong. We\u2019ll also make sure that we have trade relations with China that work for us. I\u2019ve watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and people have lost their jobs because China has not played by the same rules, in part by holding down artificially the value of their currency. It holds down the prices of their goods. It means our goods aren\u2019t as competitive and we lose jobs. That\u2019s got to end. They\u2019re making some progress; they need to make more. That\u2019s why on day one, i will label them a currency manipulator, which allows us to apply tariffs where they\u2019re taking jobs. They\u2019re stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our goods. They have to understand we want to trade with them. We want a world that\u2019s stable. We like free enterprise, but you got to play by the rules."}

We have enormous trade imbalance with China, and it\u2019s worse this year than last year, and it\u2019s worse last year than the year before.

But this can\u2019t keep on going. You can\u2019t keep on holding down the value of your currency, stealing our intellectual property, counterfeiting our products, selling them around the world, even to the United States.

They were counterfeit products being made overseas with the same serial number as a U.S. company, the same packaging, these were being sold into our market and around the world as if they were made by the U.S. competitor. This can\u2019t go on. I want a great relationship with China. China can be our partner, but \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean they can just roll all over us and steal our jobs on an unfair basis."}

If we had taken your advice Governor Romney about our auto industry, we\u2019d be buying cars from China instead of selling cars to China. If we take your advice with respect to how we change our tax codes so that companies that earn profits overseas don\u2019t pay U.S. taxes compared to companies here that are paying taxes. Now that\u2019s estimated to create 800,000 jobs, the problem is they won\u2019t be here, they\u2019ll be in places like China.

Now with respect to what we\u2019ve done with China already, U.S. exports have doubled since I came into office, to China and actually currencies are at their most advantageous point for U.S. exporters since 1993. We absolutely have to make more progress and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to keep on pressing. And when it comes to our military and Chinese security, part of the reason that we were able to pivot to the Asia-Pacific region after having ended the war in Iraq and transitioning out of Afghanistan, is precisely because this is going to be a massive growth area in the future. And we believe China can be a partner, but we\u2019re also sending a very clear signal that America is a Pacific power; that we are going to have a presence there. We are working with countries in the region to make sure, for example, that ships can pass through; that commerce continues. And we\u2019re organizing trade relations with countries other than China so that China starts feeling more pressure about meeting basic international standards.

Bringing down our deficit by adding $7 trillion of tax cuts and military spending that our military is not asking for, before we even get to the debt that we currently have, that is not going to make us more competitive. Those are the kinds of choices that the American people face right now. Having a tax code that rewards companies that are shipping jobs overseas instead of companies that are investing here in the United States, that will not make us more competitive. And the one thing that I\u2019m absolutely clear about is that after a decade in which we saw drift, jobs being shipped overseas, nobody championing American workers and American businesses, we\u2019ve now begun to make some real progress.

The policies of the last four years have seen incomes in America decline every year for middle income families, now down $4,300 during your term. Twenty-three million Americans still struggling to find a good job. When you came to office 32 million people on food stamps. Today, 47 million people on food stamps. When you came to office, just over $10 trillion in debt, now $16 trillion in debt. It hasn\u2019t worked. You said by now we\u2019d be at 5.4 percent unemployment. We\u2019re 9 million jobs short of that. I\u2019ve met some of those people. I\u2019ve met them in Appleton, Wisconsin.

And that\u2019s why it\u2019s so critical, that we make America once again the most attractive place in the world to start businesses, to build jobs, to grow the economy. And that\u2019s not going to happen by just hiring teachers. Look, I love to \u2014 I love teachers, and I\u2019m happy to have states and communities that want to hire teachers do that.

You\u2019ve now heard three debates, months of campaigning and way too many TV commercials. And now you\u2019ve got a choice. Over the last four years we\u2019ve made real progress digging our way out of policies that gave us two prolonged wars, record deficits and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. And Governor Romney wants to take us back to those policies, a foreign policy that\u2019s wrong and reckless, economic policies that won\u2019t create jobs, won\u2019t reduce our deficit, but will make sure that folks at the very top don\u2019t have to play by the same rules that you do. And I\u2019ve got a different vision for America. I want to build on our strengths. And I\u2019ve put forward a plan to make sure that we\u2019re bringing manufacturing jobs back to our shores by rewarding companies and small businesses that are investing here, not overseas. I want to make sure we\u2019ve got the best education system in the world. And we\u2019re retaining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow. I want to control our own energy by developing oil and natural gas but also the energy sources of the future. Yes, I want to reduce our deficit by cutting spending that we don\u2019t need but also by asking the wealthy to do a little bit more so that we can invest in things like research and technology that are the key to a 21st century economy. As Commander in Chief, I will maintain the strongest military in the world, keep faith with our troops and go after those who would do us harm. but after a decade of war, I think we all recognize we\u2019ve got to do some nation building here at home, rebuilding our roads, our bridges and especially caring for our Veterans who sacrificed so much for our freedom. And we\u2019ve been through tough times but we always bounce back because of our character, because we pull together and if I have the privilege of being your president for another four years, I promise you I will always listen to your voices. I will fight for your families and I will work every single day to make sure that America continues to be the greatest nation on earth. Thank you."}

I\u2019m optimistic about the future. I\u2019m excited about our prospects as a nation. I want to see peace. I want to see growing peace in this country. It\u2019s our objective. We have an opportunity to have real leadership. America\u2019s going to have that kind of leadership and continue to promote principles of peace to make a world a safer place and make people in this country more confident that their future is secure. I also want to make sure that we get this economy going. And there are two very different paths the country can take. One is a path represented by the president, which at the end of four years would mean we\u2019d have $20 trillion in debt heading towards Greece. I\u2019ll get us on track to a balanced budget. The president\u2019s path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay. I want to make sure our take-home pay turns around and starts to grow. The president\u2019s path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay. I want to make sure take-home pay turns around and starts to grow. The president\u2019s path means 20 million people out of work struggling for a good job. I\u2019ll get people back to work with 12 million new jobs. I\u2019m going to make sure that we get people off of food stamps, not by cutting the program, but by getting them good jobs. America\u2019s going to come back, and for that to happen, we\u2019re going to have to have a president who can work across the aisle. I was in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat. I learned how to get along on the other side of the aisle. We\u2019ve got to do that in Washington. Washington is broken. I know what it takes to get this country back, and will work with good Democrats and good Republicans to do that. This nation is the hope of the earth. We\u2019ve been blessed by having a nation that\u2019s free and prosperous thanks to the contributions of the greatest generation. They\u2019ve held a torch for the world to see \u2014 the torch of freedom and hope and opportunity. Now, it\u2019s our turn to take that torch. I\u2019m convinced we\u2019ll do it. We need strong leadership. I\u2019d like to be that leader with your support. I\u2019ll work with you. I\u2019ll lead you in an open and honest way, and I ask for your vote. I\u2019d like to be the next president of the United States to support and help this great nation and to make sure that we all together remain America as the hope of the earth. Thank you so much."}

I can\u2019t think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country. You know, we are at a defining moment in our history. Our nation is involved in two wars, and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And although we\u2019ve heard a lot about Wall Street, those of you on Main Street I think have been struggling for a while, and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy. And you\u2019re wondering, how\u2019s it going to affect me? How\u2019s it going to affect my job? How\u2019s it going to affect my house? How\u2019s it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college? So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely. And I\u2019ve put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort. Number one, we\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019ve got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money. Number two, we\u2019ve got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market \u2014 and when the market returns. Number three, we\u2019ve got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes. And, number four, we\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country. Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down. It hasn\u2019t worked. And I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for president, and that\u2019s what I hope we\u2019re going to be talking about tonight."}

Senator Kennedy is in the hospital. He\u2019s a dear and beloved friend to all of us. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the lion of the Senate. I also want to thank the University of Mississippi for hosting us tonight. And, Jim, I \u2014 I\u2019ve been not feeling too great about a lot of things lately. So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges. But I\u2019m feeling a little better tonight, and I\u2019ll tell you why. Because as we\u2019re here tonight in this debate, we are seeing, for the first time in a long time, Republicans and Democrats together, sitting down, trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that we\u2019re in. And have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis. And we\u2019re not talking about failure of institutions on Wall Street. We\u2019re talking about failures on Main Street, and people who will lose their jobs, and their credits, and their homes, if we don\u2019t fix the greatest fiscal crisis, probably in \u2014 certainly in our time, and I\u2019ve been around a little while. But the point is \u2014 the point is, we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package. This package has transparency in it. It has to have accountability and oversight. It has to have options for loans to failing businesses, rather than the government taking over those loans. We have to \u2014 it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it. And, yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives. And they weren\u2019t part of the negotiations, and I understand that. And it was the House Republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem. But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight. This isn\u2019t the beginning of the end of this crisis. This is the end of the beginning, if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable. And we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do. And we\u2019ve got to create jobs. And one of the areas, of course, is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil."}

And I do think that there\u2019s constructive work being done out there. So, for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan. The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place? Two years ago, I warned that, because of the subprime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time. Last year, I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it. So \u2014 so the question, I think, that we\u2019ve got to ask ourselves is, yes, we\u2019ve got to solve this problem short term. And we are going to have to intervene; there\u2019s no doubt about that. But we\u2019re also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations? We did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems. And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad."}

But \u2014 but let me \u2014 let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that. A lot of us saw this train wreck coming. But there\u2019s also the issue of responsibility. You\u2019ve mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower. President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters. One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever. And he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy. Somehow we\u2019ve lost that accountability. I\u2019ve been heavily criticized because I called for the resignation of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We\u2019ve got to start also holding people accountable, and we\u2019ve got to reward people who succeed. But somehow in Washington today \u2014 and I\u2019m afraid on Wall Street \u2014 greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption \u2014 or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded. As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration. And I promise you that that will happen."}

We Republicans came to power to change government, and government changed us. And the \u2014 the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend, Tom Coburn, calls earmarking as a gateway drug, because it\u2019s a gateway. It\u2019s a gateway to out-of-control spending and corruption. And we have former members of Congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork-barrel spending. You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana. I don\u2019t know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers\u2019 money. And it has got to be brought under control. As president of the United States, I want to assure you, I\u2019ve got a pen. This one\u2019s kind of old. I\u2019ve got a pen, and I\u2019m going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk. I will make them famous. You will know their names. Now, Senator Obama, you wanted to know one of the differences. He has asked for $932 million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that he\u2019s been in the United States Senate. I suggest that people go up on the Web site of Citizens Against Government Waste, and they\u2019ll look at those projects. That kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spending in Washington, D.C. That\u2019s one of the fundamental differences that Senator Obama and I have."}

And he\u2019s also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn\u2019t the case with me. But let\u2019s be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year\u2019s budget. Senator McCain is proposing \u2014 and this is a fundamental difference between us \u2014 $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion. Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important. And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out. So my attitude is, we\u2019ve got to grow the economy from the bottom up. What I\u2019ve called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent. And that means that the ordinary American out there who\u2019s collecting a paycheck every day, they\u2019ve got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them. And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the \u2014 the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to \u2014 wants to follow."}

And when I\u2019m president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely. But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we\u2019re going to get the middle class back on track.

SENATOR BARACK OBAMA (IL)DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE","Moderators":"JIM LEHRER","Speaker":"MCCAIN","Text":"Well \u2014 well, let me give you an example of what Senator Obama finds objectionable, the business tax. Right now, in the United States of America, business pays the second-highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent. Ireland pays 11 percent. Now, if you\u2019re a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where it\u2019s 11 percent tax versus 35 percent, you\u2019re going to be able to create jobs, increase your business, make more investment, et cetera. I want to cut that business tax. I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in \u2014 in the United States of America and create jobs. But, again, I want to return. It\u2019s a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending. I can tell you, it\u2019s rife. It\u2019s throughout. The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000 \u2014 2,000 \u2014 look at them, my friends. Look at them. You\u2019ll be appalled. And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects. So the point is, I want people to have tax cuts. I want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care. I want to double the dividend from $3,500 to $7,000 for every dependent child in America.

And if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dime\u2019s worth of tax increase. Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and he\u2019s absolutely right. Here\u2019s the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world. And what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more. It\u2019s not like you want to close the loopholes. You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes. And that\u2019s a problem. Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5,000 health credit. Now, what he doesn\u2019t tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits. So you may end up getting a $5,000 tax credit. Here\u2019s the only problem: Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that you\u2019re getting from your employer. And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, you\u2019ve got to go out on the open market and try to buy it. It is not a good deal for the American people. But it\u2019s an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off we\u2019re going to be."}

We don\u2019t yet know what our tax revenues are going to be. The economy is slowing down, so it\u2019s hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year. But there\u2019s no doubt that we\u2019re not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done. There are some things that I think have to be done. We have to have energy independence, so I\u2019ve put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years\u2019 time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on Middle Eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy, solar, wind, biodiesel, making sure that we\u2019re developing the fuel-efficient cars of the future right here in the United States, in Ohio and Michigan, instead of Japan and South Korea. We have to fix our health care system, which is putting an enormous burden on families. Just \u2014 a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families. They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care. I\u2019m meeting folks all over the country. We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off. The third thing we have to do is we\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re competing in education. We\u2019ve got to invest in science and technology. China had a space launch and a space walk. We\u2019ve got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science. And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America. And I also think that we\u2019re going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities. Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them. So there are some \u2014 some things that we\u2019ve got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy. We can\u2019t shortchange those things. We\u2019ve got to eliminate programs that don\u2019t work, and we\u2019ve got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less."}

It\u2019s hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left. The point \u2014 the point is \u2014 the point is, we need to examine every agency of government. First of all, by the way, I\u2019d eliminate ethanol subsidies. I oppose ethanol subsidies. I think that we have to return \u2014 particularly in defense spending, which is the largest part of our appropriations \u2014 we have to do away with cost-plus contracts. We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control. We tried to build a little ship called the Littoral Combat Ship that was supposed to cost $140 million, ended up costing $400 million, and we still haven\u2019t done it. So we need to have fixed-cost contracts. We need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control. I know how to do that. I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong. And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this because I\u2019ve been involved these issues for many, many years.

We owe China $500 billion. And spending, I know, can be brought under control because I have fought against excessive spending my entire career. And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if there\u2019s anybody here who thinks there aren\u2019t agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in Washington."}

Our initial military success, we went in to Baghdad and everybody celebrated. And then the war was very badly mishandled. I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said, we\u2019ve got to change this strategy. This strategy requires additional troops, it requires a fundamental change in strategy and I fought for it. And finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded. This strategy has succeeded. And we are winning in Iraq. And we will come home with victory and with honor. And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds. And I want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy. The consequences of defeat would have been increased Iranian influence. It would have been increase in sectarian violence. It would have been a wider war, which the United States of America might have had to come back. So there was a lot at stake there. And thanks to this great general, David Petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded. And we are winning in Iraq, and we will come home. And we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat."}

Now six years ago, I stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world, and whether our intelligence was sound, but also because we hadn\u2019t finished the job in Afghanistan. We hadn\u2019t caught bin Laden. We hadn\u2019t put al Qaeda to rest, and as a consequence, I thought that it was going to be a distraction. Now Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment. And I wish I had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right, but that\u2019s not the case. We\u2019ve spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion. We have lost over 4,000 lives. We have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001. We took our eye off the ball. And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government. So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and I will not, as president, in order to keep the American people safe. But we have to use our military wisely. And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq."}

First of all, let\u2019s talk about this troop funding issue because John always brings this up. Senator McCain cut \u2014 Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn\u2019t believe in a timetable. I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush. We had a difference on the timetable. We didn\u2019t have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops. We had a legitimate difference, and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy. And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there. The question is, was this wise? We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate. We need more troops there. We need more resources there. Senator McCain, in the rush to go into Iraq, said, you know what? We\u2019ve been successful in Afghanistan. There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there. This is a time when bin Laden was still out, and now they\u2019ve reconstituted themselves. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in Afghanistan and it needs to end there. But we can\u2019t do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country. Now, what I\u2019ve said is we should end this war responsibly. We should do it in phases. But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put \u2014 provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda. And right now, the commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have acknowledged that we don\u2019t have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge."}

And I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 understand why Senator Obama was surprised and said that the surge succeeded beyond his wildest expectations.

And I think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because it\u2019s been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better. We had the highest fatalities among U.S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002. And we are seeing a major offensive taking place \u2014 Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion. They are feeling emboldened. And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we don\u2019t have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan. So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan. Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9\/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no Al Qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan. And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front \u2014 that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan. So here\u2019s what we have to do comprehensively, though. It\u2019s not just more troops. We have to press the Afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people. And I\u2019ve said this to President Karzai. Number two, we\u2019ve got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years. Number three, we\u2019ve got to deal with Pakistan, because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, we\u2019ve been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens. And until we do, Americans here at home are not going to be safe."}

And the result over time was the Taliban, Al Qaida, and a lot of the difficulties we are facing today. So we can\u2019t ignore those lessons of history. Now, on this issue of aiding Pakistan, if you\u2019re going to aim a gun at somebody, George Shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, you\u2019d better be prepared to pull the trigger. I\u2019m not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan. So I\u2019m not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan. We\u2019ve got to get the support of the people of \u2014 of Pakistan. He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan. Now, you don\u2019t do that. You don\u2019t say that out loud. If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government. Now, the new president of Pakistan, Kardari (sic), has got his hands full. And this area on the border has not been governed since the days of Alexander the Great. I\u2019ve been to Waziristan. I can see how tough that terrain is. It\u2019s ruled by a handful of tribes. And, yes, Senator Obama calls for more troops, but what he doesn\u2019t understand, it\u2019s got to be a new strategy, the same strategy that he condemned in Iraq. It\u2019s going to have to be employed in Afghanistan. And we\u2019re going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people. And it\u2019s going to be tough. They\u2019ve intermarried with Al Qaida and the Taliban. And it\u2019s going to be tough. But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas. And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they don\u2019t want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements. So we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan. But I\u2019m confident, now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops \u2014 and, by the way, there have been 20,000 additional troops, from 32,000 to 53,000, and there needs to be more. So it\u2019s not just the addition of troops that matters. It\u2019s a strategy that will succeed. And Pakistan is a very important element in this. And I know how to work with them. And I guarantee you I would not publicly state that I\u2019m going to attack them."}

Now, I think that\u2019s the right strategy; I think that\u2019s the right policy. And, John, I \u2014 you\u2019re absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say. But, you know, coming from you, who, you know, in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and, you know, sung songs about bombing Iran, I don\u2019t know, you know, how credible that is. I think this is the right strategy. Now, Senator McCain is also right that it\u2019s difficult. This is not an easy situation. You\u2019ve got cross-border attacks against U.S. troops. And we\u2019ve got a choice. We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions. And the problem, John, with the strategy that\u2019s been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled Musharraf, we alienated the Pakistani population, because we were anti-democratic. We had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, \u201cWell, you know, he may be a dictator, but he\u2019s our dictator.\u201d And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan. We spent $10 billion. And in the meantime, they weren\u2019t going after Al Qaida, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan.

Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state. But let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing Iran and all that, let me tell you my record. Back in 1983, when I was a brand-new United States congressman, the one \u2014 the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon. And I saw that, and I saw the situation, and I stood up, and I voted against that, because I was afraid that they couldn\u2019t make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference. Tragically, I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks. And then we had Somalia \u2014 then we had the first Gulf War. I supported \u2014 I supported that. I supported us going into Bosnia, when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in Bosnia. That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe. I supported what we did in Kosovo. I supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there. And I have a record \u2014 and Somalia, I opposed that we should turn \u2014 turn the force in Somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of. So I have a record. I have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harm\u2019s way. And I\u2019ll tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, \u201cSenator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son\u2019s name on it.\u201d He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad, Matthew Stanley, before Christmas last year. This was last August, a year ago. And I said, \u201cI will \u2014 I will wear his bracelet with honor.\u201d And this was August, a year ago. And then she said, \u201cBut, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything \u2014 promise me one thing, that you\u2019ll do everything in your power to make sure that my son\u2019s death was not in vain.\u201d That means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re-enlisted in Baghdad, just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed. And they all say to me that we don\u2019t want defeat. I know what that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like when an army is defeated. A war that I was in, where we had an Army, that it wasn\u2019t through any fault of their own, but they were defeated. And I know how hard it is for that \u2014 for an Army and a military to recover from that. And it did and we will win this one and we won\u2019t come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail."}

Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust. Let\u2019s just make that very clear. What I have proposed for a long time, and I\u2019ve had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, let\u2019s be clear and let\u2019s have some straight talk. The Russians are preventing significant action in the United Nations Security Council. I have proposed a league of democracies, a group of people \u2013 a group of countries that share common interests, common values, common ideals, they also control a lot of the world\u2019s economic power. We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect. The Iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues. So I am convinced that together, we can, with the French, with the British, with the Germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect Iranian behavior. But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight. And it is a threat not only in this region but around the world. What I\u2019d also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans, there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran. There is the Republican Guard in Iran, which Senator Kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror. Senator Obama said that would be provocative. So this is a serious threat. This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons."}

I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization. I\u2019ve consistently said so. What Senator McCain refers to is a measure in the Senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of Iraq. To deal with Iran. And ironically, the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq. Iraq was Iran\u2019s mortal enemy. That was cleared away. And what we\u2019ve seen over the last several years is Iran\u2019s influence grow. They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon. So obviously, our policy over the last eight years has not worked. Senator McCain is absolutely right, we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran. It would be a game changer. Not only would it threaten Israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this Middle East. Now here\u2019s what we need to do. We do need tougher sanctions. I do not agree with Senator McCain that we\u2019re going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with countries like Russia and China that are, I think Senator McCain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesn\u2019t have a nuclear weapon. But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked. It has not worked in Iran, it has not worked in North Korea. In each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons. That will change when I\u2019m president of the United States."}

First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran. So he may not be the right person to talk to. But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it\u2019s going to keep America safe. And I\u2019m glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy. Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, who\u2019s one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran \u2014 guess what \u2014 without precondition. This is one of your own advisers. Now, understand what this means \u201cwithout preconditions.\u201d It doesn\u2019t mean that you invite them over for tea one day. What it means is that we don\u2019t do what we\u2019ve been doing, which is to say, \u201cUntil you agree to do exactly what we say, we won\u2019t have direct contacts with you.\u201d There\u2019s a difference between preconditions and preparation. Of course we\u2019ve got to do preparations, starting with low-level diplomatic talks, and it may not work, because Iran is a rogue regime. But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with Iran. And you know what? President Bush recently sent a senior ambassador, Bill Burns, to participate in talks with the Europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons. Again, it may not work, but if it doesn\u2019t work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned. And when we haven\u2019t done it, as in North Korea \u2014 let me just take one more example \u2014 in North Korea, we cut off talks. They\u2019re a member of the axis of evil. We can\u2019t deal with them. And you know what happened? They went \u2014 they quadrupled their nuclear capacity. They tested a nuke. They tested missiles. They pulled out of the nonproliferation agreement. And they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like Syria. When we re-engaged \u2014 because, again, the Bush administration reversed course on this \u2014 then we have at least made some progress, although right now, because of the problems in North Korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground. And \u2014 and I just \u2014 so I just have to make this general point that the Bush administration, some of Senator McCain\u2019s own advisers all think this is important, and Senator McCain appears resistant. He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he \u2014 you know, he wasn\u2019t sure whether they were aligned with us. I mean, Spain? Spain is a NATO ally."}

This is dangerous. It isn\u2019t just naive; it\u2019s dangerous. And so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion. As far as North Korea is concerned, our secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, went to North Korea. By the way, North Korea, most repressive and brutal regime probably on Earth. The average South Korean is three inches taller than the average North Korean, a huge gulag.

Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable. They were unwarranted. And at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six-party \u2014 or the six-point cease-fire. They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship. And we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region, you know, the Estonians, the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the Poles, the Czechs, that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts. They are members of NATO. And to countries like Georgia and the Ukraine, I think we have to insist that they are free to join NATO if they meet the requirements, and they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in. Now, we also can\u2019t return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia. It\u2019s important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest. One is nuclear proliferation. They have not only 15,000 nuclear warheads, but they\u2019ve got enough to make another 40,000, and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of Al Qaida. This is an area where I\u2019ve led on in the Senate, working with a Republican ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Dick Lugar, to deal with the proliferation of loose nuclear weapons. That\u2019s an area where we\u2019re going to have to work with Russia. But we have to have a president who is clear that you don\u2019t deal with Russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul. You deal with Russia based on, what are your \u2014 what are the national security interests of the United States of America? And we have to recognize that the way they\u2019ve been behaving lately demands a sharp response from the international community and our allies."}

SENATOR BARACK OBAMA (IL)DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE","Moderators":"JIM LEHRER","Speaker":"MCCAIN","Text":"Well, I was interested in Senator Obama\u2019s reaction to the Russian aggression against Georgia. His first statement was, \u201cBoth sides ought to show restraint.\u201d Again, a little bit of naivete there. He doesn\u2019t understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia. And Russia has now become a nation fueled by petro-dollars that is basically a KGB apparatchik-run government. I looked into Mr. Putin\u2019s eyes, and I saw three letters, a \u201cK,\u201d a \u201cG,\u201d and a \u201cB.\u201d And their aggression in Georgia is not acceptable behavior. I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to go back to the Cold War. I am sure that that will not happen. But I do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies. And that wasn\u2019t just about a problem between Georgia and Russia. It had everything to do with energy. There\u2019s a pipeline that runs from the Caspian through Georgia through Turkey. And, of course, we know that the Russians control other sources of energy into Europe, which they have used from time to time. It\u2019s not accidental that the presidents of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine flew to Georgia, flew to Tbilisi, where I have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, Misha Saakashvili. And they showed solidarity with them, but, also, they are very concerned about the Russian threats to regain their status of the old Russian to regain their status of the old Russian empire. Now, I think the Russians ought to understand that we will support \u2014 we, the United States \u2014 will support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in the natural process, inclusion into NATO. We also ought to make it very clear that the Russians are in violation of their cease-fire agreement. They have stationed additional troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. By the way, I went there once, and we went inside and drove in, and there was a huge poster. And this is \u2014 this is Georgian territory. And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin, and it said, \u201cVladimir Putin, our president.\u201d It was very clear, the Russian intentions towards Georgia. They were just waiting to seize the opportunity. So, this is a very difficult situation. We want to work with the Russians. But we also have every right to expect the Russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a \u2014 with a \u2014 with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior. And watch Ukraine. This whole thing has got a lot to do with Ukraine, Crimea, the base of the Russian fleet in Sevastopol. And the breakdown of the political process in Ukraine between Tymoshenko and Yushchenko is a very serious problem. So watch Ukraine, and let\u2019s make sure that we \u2014 that the Ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally."}

S. SENATOR BARACK OBAMA (IL)DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE","Moderators":"JIM LEHRER","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"No, actually, I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these issues. Obviously, I disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to Russians going into Georgia. I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable. And, absolutely, I wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on Georgia, and that\u2019s why I was the first to say that we have to rebuild the Georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild. Because part of Russia\u2019s intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more. Two points I think are important to think about when it comes to Russia. Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems. So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory. That made no sense whatsoever. And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over. That wasn\u2019t done. But had it been done, it\u2019s possible we could have avoided the issue. The second point I want to make is \u2014 is the issue of energy. Russia is in part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as Senator McCain mentioned. That means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil \u2014 25 percent of the world\u2019s oil \u2014 have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with Russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states we\u2019ve talked about, Iran, Venezuela. And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world\u2019s oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world\u2019s oil. So we can\u2019t simply drill our way out of the problem. What we\u2019re going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology. And, you know, I\u2019ve got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that. And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record. Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel. And so we \u2014 we \u2014 we\u2019ve got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump \u2014 and, you know, winter\u2019s coming and home heating oil \u2014 as it is our national security and the issue of climate change that\u2019s so important."}

I think it \u2014 that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe. And I want to tell you that one of the things I\u2019m most proud of, among others, because I have worked across the aisle. I have a long record on that, on a long series of reforms. But after 9\/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9\/11, and find out what happened, and fix it. And we were \u2014 we were opposed by the administration, another area where I differed with this administration. And we were stymied until the families of 9\/11 came, and they descended on Washington, and we got that legislation passed. And there were a series of recommendations, as I recall, more than 40. And I\u2019m happy to say that we\u2019ve gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission. I\u2019m proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, Democrat and Republican alike. So we have a long way to go in our intelligence services. We have to do a better job in human intelligence. And we\u2019ve got to \u2014 to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we don\u2019t ever torture a prisoner ever again. We have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better. We have to work more closely with our allies. I know our allies, and I can work much more closely with them. But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than it was on 9\/11. But that doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t have a long way to go. And I\u2019d like to remind you, also, as a result of those recommendations, we\u2019ve probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the Defense Department. And I think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job. But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well."}

Obviously, we\u2019ve poured billions of dollars into airport security. We have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go. We\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re hardening our chemical sites. We haven\u2019t done enough in terms of transit; we haven\u2019t done enough in terms of ports. And the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies. It\u2019s in a suitcase. This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important. It is the \u2014 the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons. And we \u2014 we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense. And I actually believe that we need missile defense, because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but I also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then we\u2019re making a mistake. The other thing that we have to focus on, though, is Al Qaida. They are now operating in 60 countries. We can\u2019t simply be focused on Iraq. We have to go to the root cause, and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan. That\u2019s going to be critical. We are going to need more cooperation with our allies. And one last point I want to make. It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism. And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore America\u2019s standing in the world. We are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago. And this is the greatest country on Earth. But because of some of the mistakes that have been made \u2014 and I give Senator McCain great credit on the torture issue, for having identified that as something that undermines our long-term security \u2014 because of those things, we, I think, are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that America is that shining beacon on a hill."}

The consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain, regardless of conditions, according to our military leaders, according to every expert, would lead to defeat \u2014 possible defeat, loss of all the fragile sacrifice that we\u2019ve made of American blood and treasure, which grieves us all. All of that would be lost if we followed Senator Obama\u2019s plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground. And General Petraeus says we have had great success, but it\u2019s very fragile. And we can\u2019t do what Senator Obama wants to do. That is the central issue of our time.

In the meantime, we\u2019ve got challenges, for example, with China, where we are borrowing billions of dollars. They now hold a trillion dollars\u2019 worth of our debt. And they are active in countries like \u2014 in regions like Latin America, and Asia, and Africa. They are \u2014 the conspicuousness of their presence is only matched by our absence, because we\u2019ve been focused on Iraq. We have weakened our capacity to project power around the world because we have viewed everything through this single lens, not to mention, look at our economy. We are now spending $10 billion or more every month. And that means we can\u2019t provide health care to people who need it. We can\u2019t invest in science and technology, which will determine whether or not we are going to be competitive in the long term. There has never been a country on Earth that saw its economy decline and yet maintained its military superiority. So this is a national security issue. We haven\u2019t adequately funded veterans\u2019 care. I sit on the Veterans Affairs Committee, and we\u2019ve got \u2014 I meet veterans all across the country who are trying to figure out, \u201cHow can I get disability payments?

And, Governor, it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, and it\u2019s a pleasure to be with you. I think it\u2019s neither the best or worst of Washington, but it\u2019s evidence of the fact that the economic policies of the last eight years have been the worst economic policies we\u2019ve ever had. As a consequence, you\u2019ve seen what\u2019s happened on Wall Street. If you need any more proof positive of how bad the economic theories have been, this excessive deregulation, the failure to oversee what was going on, letting Wall Street run wild, I don\u2019t think you needed any more evidence than what you see now. So the Congress has been put \u2014 Democrats and Republicans have been put in a very difficult spot. But Barack Obama laid out four basic criteria for any kind of rescue plan here. He, first of all, said there has to be oversight. We\u2019re not going to write any check to anybody unless there\u2019s oversight for the \u2014 of the secretary of Treasury. He secondly said you have to focus on homeowners and folks on Main Street. Thirdly, he said that you have to treat the taxpayers like investors in this case. And, lastly, what you have to do is make sure that CEOs don\u2019t benefit from this, because this could end up, in the long run, people making money off of this rescue plan. And so, as a consequence of that, it brings us back to maybe the fundamental disagreement between Governor Palin and me and Senator McCain and Barack Obama, and that is that the \u2014 we\u2019re going to fundamentally change the focus of the economic policy. We\u2019re going to focus on the middle class, because it\u2019s \u2014 when the middle class is growing, the economy grows and everybody does well, not just focus on the wealthy and corporate America."}

And I thank the commission, also. I appreciate this privilege of being able to be here and speak with Americans. You know, I think a good barometer here, as we try to figure out has this been a good time or a bad time in America\u2019s economy, is go to a kid\u2019s soccer game on Saturday, and turn to any parent there on the sideline and ask them, \u201cHow are you feeling about the economy?\u201d And I\u2019ll bet you, you\u2019re going to hear some fear in that parent\u2019s voice, fear regarding the few investments that some of us have in the stock market. Did we just take a major hit with those investments? Fear about, how are we going to afford to send our kids to college? A fear, as small-business owners, perhaps, how we\u2019re going to borrow any money to increase inventory or hire more people. The barometer there, I think, is going to be resounding that our economy is hurting and the federal government has not provided the sound oversight that we need and that we deserve, and we need reform to that end. Now, John McCain thankfully has been one representing reform. Two years ago, remember, it was John McCain who pushed so hard with the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reform measures. He sounded that warning bell. People in the Senate with him, his colleagues, didn\u2019t want to listen to him and wouldn\u2019t go towards that reform that was needed then. I think that the alarm has been heard, though, and there will be that greater oversight, again thanks to John McCain\u2019s bipartisan efforts that he was so instrumental in bringing folks together over this past week, even suspending his own campaign to make sure he was putting excessive politics aside and putting the country first."}

We let Wall Street run wild. John McCain and he\u2019s a good man, but John McCain thought the answer is that tried and true Republican response, deregulate, deregulate. So what you had is you had overwhelming \u201cderegulation.\u201d You had actually the belief that Wall Street could self-regulate itself. And while Barack Obama was talking about reinstating those regulations, John on 20 different occasions in the previous year and a half called for more deregulation. As a matter of fact, John recently wrote an article in a major magazine saying that he wants to do for the health care industry deregulate it and let the free market move like he did for the banking industry. So deregulation was the promise. And guess what? Those people who say don\u2019t go into debt, they can barely pay to fill up their gas tank.

Now, that\u2019s not what we need to create jobs and really bolster and heat up our economy. We do need the private sector to be able to keep more of what we earn and produce. Government is going to have to learn to be more efficient and live with less if that\u2019s what it takes to reign in the government growth that we\u2019ve seen today.

Now, as for John McCain\u2019s adherence to rules and regulations and pushing for even harder and tougher regulations, that is another thing that he is known for though. Look at the tobacco industry. Look at campaign finance reform."}

The middle class is struggling. The middle class under John McCain\u2019s tax proposal, 100 million families, middle class families, households to be precise, they got not a single change, they got not a single break in taxes. No one making less than $250,000 under Barack Obama\u2019s plan will see one single penny of their tax raised whether it\u2019s their capital gains tax, their income tax, investment tax, any tax. And 95 percent of the people in the United States of America making less than $150,000 will get a tax break. Now, that seems to me to be simple fairness. The economic engine of America is middle class. It\u2019s the people listening to this broadcast. When you do well, America does well. Even the wealthy do well. This is not punitive. John wants to add $300 million, billion in new tax cuts per year for corporate America and the very wealthy while giving virtually nothing to the middle class. We have a different value set. The middle class is the economic engine. It\u2019s fair. They deserve the tax breaks, not the super wealthy who are doing pretty well. They don\u2019t need any more tax breaks. And by the way, they\u2019ll pay no more than they did under Ronald Reagan."}

So they\u2019re going to be the ones paying higher taxes thus resulting in fewer jobs being created and less productivity. Now you said recently that higher taxes or asking for higher taxes or paying higher taxes is patriotic. In the middle class of America which is where Todd and I have been all of our lives, that\u2019s not patriotic. Patriotic is saying, government, you know, you\u2019re not always the solution. In fact, too often you\u2019re the problem so, government, lessen the tax burden and on our families and get out of the way and let the private sector and our families grow and thrive and prosper. An increased tax formula that Barack Obama is proposing in addition to nearly a trillion dollars in new spending that he\u2019s proposing is the backwards way of trying to grow our economy."}

That\u2019s a smart thing to do. That\u2019s budget neutral.

But a $5,000 health care credit through our income tax that\u2019s budget neutral. That\u2019s going to help. And he also wants to erase those artificial lines between states so that through competition, we can cross state lines and if there\u2019s a better plan offered somewhere else, we would be able to purchase that.

I had to take on those oil companies and tell them, \u201cNo,\u201d you know, any of the greed there that has been kind of instrumental, I guess, in their mode of operation, that wasn\u2019t going to happen in my state. And that\u2019s why Tillerson at Exxon and Mulva at ConocoPhillips, bless their hearts, they\u2019re doing what they need to do, as corporate CEOs, but they\u2019re not my biggest fans, because what I had to do up there in Alaska was to break up a monopoly up there and say, you know, the people are going to come first and we\u2019re going to make sure that we have value given to the people of Alaska with those resources. And those huge tax breaks aren\u2019t coming to the big multinational corporations anymore, not when it adversely affects the people who live in a state and, in this case, in a country who should be benefiting at the same time. So it was Barack Obama who voted for that energy plan that gave those tax breaks to the oil companies that I then had to turn around, as a governor of an energy-producing state, and kind of undo in my own area of expertise, and that\u2019s energy."}

And, look, I agree with the governor. She imposed a windfall profits tax up there in Alaska. That\u2019s what Barack Obama and I want to do. We want to be able to do for all of you Americans, give you back $1,000 bucks, like she\u2019s been able to give back money to her folks back there.

When we talk about energy, we have to consider the need to do all that we can to allow this nation to become energy independent. It\u2019s a nonsensical position that we are in when we have domestic supplies of energy all over this great land. And East Coast politicians who don\u2019t allow energy-producing states like Alaska to produce these, to tap into them, and instead we\u2019re relying on foreign countries to produce for us. We\u2019re circulating about $700 billion a year into foreign countries, some who do not like America \u2014 they certainly don\u2019t have our best interests at heart \u2014 instead of those dollars circulating here, creating tens of thousands of jobs and allowing domestic supplies of energy to be tapped into and start flowing into these very, very hungry markets.

We have got to encourage other nations also to come along with us with the impacts of climate change, what we can do about that. As governor, I was the first governor to form a climate change sub-cabinet to start dealing with the impacts. We\u2019ve got to reduce emissions. John McCain is right there with an \u201call of the above\u201d approach to deal with climate change impacts. We\u2019ve got to become energy independent for that reason.

I know that the other ticket opposed this surge, in fact, even opposed funding for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Barack Obama voted against funding troops there after promising that he would not do so. And Senator Biden, I respected you when you called him out on that. You said that his vote was political and you said it would cost lives. And Barack Obama at first said he would not do that. He turned around under political pressure and he voted against funding the troops. We do have a plan for withdrawal. We don\u2019t need early withdrawal out of Iraq. We cannot afford to lose there or we\u2019re going to be no better off in the war in Afghanistan either. We have got to win in Iraq. And with the surge that has worked we\u2019re now down to presurge numbers in Iraq. That\u2019s where we can be. We can start putting more troops in Afghanistan as we also work with our NATO allies who are there strengthening us and we need to grow our military. We cannot afford to lose against al Qaeda and the Shia extremists who are still there, still fighting us, but we\u2019re getting closer and closer to victory. And it would be a travesty if we quit now in Iraq."}

Barack Obama has offered a clear plan. Shift responsibility to Iraqis over the next 16 months. Draw down our combat troops. Ironically the same plan that Maliki, the prime minister of Iraq and George Bush are now negotiating. The only odd man out here, only one left out is John McCain, number one. Number two, with regard to Barack Obama not \u2014 quote \u2014 \u201cfunding the troops,\u201d John McCain voted the exact same way. John McCain voted against funding the troops because of an amendment he voted against had a timeline in it to draw down American troops. And John said I\u2019m not going to fund the troops if in fact there\u2019s a timeline. Barack Obama and I agree fully and completely on one thing: You\u2019ve got to have a time line to draw down the troops and shift responsibility to the Iraqis. We\u2019re spending $10 billion a month while Iraqis have an $80 billion surplus. Barack says it\u2019s time for them to spend their own money and have the 400,000 military we trained for them begin to take their own responsibility and gradually over six months \u2014 16 months, withdrawal. John McCain \u2014 this is a fundamental difference between us, we will end this war. For John McCain, there\u2019s no end in sight to end this war, fundamental difference. We will end this war."}

We\u2019ll know when we\u2019re finished in Iraq when the Iraqi government can govern its people and when the Iraqi security forces can secure its people. And our commanders on the ground will tell us when those conditions have been met. And Maliki and Talabani also in working with us are knowing again that we are getting closer and closer to that point, that victory that\u2019s within sight. Now, you said regarding Senator McCain\u2019s military policies there, Senator Biden, that you supported a lot of these things. In fact, you said in fact that you wanted to run, you\u2019d be honored to run with him on the ticket, and that\u2019s an indication I think of some of the support that you had at least until you became the VP pick here. You also said that Barack Obama was not ready to be commander in chief. And I know again that you opposed the move that he made to try to cut off funding for the troops and I respect you for that. I don\u2019t know how you can defend that position now, but I know that you know especially with your son in the National Guard and I have great respect for your family also and the honor that you show our military.

He voted against it. He voted against funding because he said the amendment had a time line in it to end this war, and he didn\u2019t like that. But let\u2019s get straight who has been right and wrong. John McCain and Dick Cheney said when I was saying we would not be greeted as liberators, we would not \u2013 this war would take a decade, not a day, not a week, not six months, we would not be out of there quickly. John McCain was saying the Sunnis and Shias got along with each other without reading the history of the last 700 years. John McCain said there would be enough oil to pay for this. John McCain has been dead wrong. I love him. As my mother would say, god love him, but he\u2019s been dead wrong on the fundamental issues relating to the conduct of the war.

I always am focused, as you know Gwen, I have been focusing on for a long time, along with Barack on Pakistan. Pakistan already has nuclear weapons. Pakistan already has deployed nuclear weapons. Pakistan\u2019s weapons can already hit Israel and the Mediterranean. Iran getting a nuclear weapon would be very, very destabilizing. They are more than \u2013 they are not close to getting a nuclear weapon that\u2019s able to be deployed. So they\u2019re both very dangerous. They both would be game changers. But look, here\u2019s what the fundamental problem I have with John\u2019s policy about terror instability. John continues to tell us that the central war in the front on terror is in Iraq. I promise you, if an attack comes in the homeland, it\u2019s going to come as our security services have said, it is going to come from al Qaeda planning in the hills of Afghanistan and Pakistan. That\u2019s where they live. That\u2019s where they are. That\u2019s where it will come from. And right now that resides in Pakistan. A stable government needs to be established. We need to support that democracy by helping them not only with their military but with their governance and their economic well-being. There have been 7,000 madrasses built along that border. We should be helping them build schools to compete for those hearts and minds of the people in the region so that we\u2019re actually able to take on terrorism. And by the way, that\u2019s where bin Laden lives and we will go at him if we have actionable intelligence."}

And as for who termed that central war on terror being in Iraq, it was General Petraeus and al Qaeda, both leaders there and it\u2019s probably the only thing that they\u2019re ever going to agree on, but that it was a central war on terror is in Iraq. You don\u2019t have to believe me or John McCain on that. I would believe Petraeus and that leader of al Qaeda. An armed, nuclear armed especially, Iran is so extremely dangerous to consider. They cannot be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons period. Israel is in jeopardy of course when we\u2019re dealing with Ahmadinejad as a leader of Iran. Iran claiming that Israel is, he termed it, a stinking corpse, a country that should be wiped off the face of the earth. Now a leader like Ahmadinejad who is not sane or stable when he says things like that is not one whom we can allow to acquire nuclear energy, nuclear weapons. Ahmadinejad, Kim Jong Il, the Castro brothers, others who are dangerous dictators are ones that Barack Obama has said he would be willing to meet with without preconditions being met first. An issue like that taken up by a presidential candidate goes beyond naivete and goes beyond poor judgment. A statement that he made like that is downright dangerous, because leaders like Ahmadinejad who would seek to acquire nuclear weapons and wipe off the face of the earth an ally like we have in Israel should not be met with without preconditions and diplomatic efforts being undertaken first."}

That is beyond bad judgment. That is dangerous. No, diplomacy is very important. First and foremost, that is what we would engage in. But diplomacy is hard work by serious people.

That\u2019s just simply not true about Barack Obama. He did not say sit down with Ahmadinejad. The fact of the matter is, it surprises me that Senator McCain doesn\u2019t realize that Ahmadinejad does not control the security apparatus in Iran. The theocracy controls the security apparatus, number one. Number two, five secretaries of state did say we should talk with and sit down. Now, John and Governor Palin now say they\u2019re all for \u2014 they have a passion, I think the phrase was, a passion for diplomacy and that we have to bring our friends and allies along. Our friends and allies have been saying, Gwen, \u201cSit down. Talk. Talk. Talk.\u201d Our friends and allies have been saying that, five secretaries of state, three of them Republicans. And John McCain has said he would go along with an agreement, but he wouldn\u2019t sit down. Now, how do you do that when you don\u2019t have your administration sit down and talk with the adversary? And look what President Bush did. After five years, he finally sent a high-ranking diplomat to meet with the highest-ranking diplomats in Iran, in Europe, to try to work out an arrangement. Our allies are on that same page. And if we don\u2019t go the extra mile on diplomacy, what makes you think the allies are going to sit with us? The last point I\u2019ll make, John McCain said as recently as a couple of weeks ago he wouldn\u2019t even sit down with the government of Spain, a NATO ally that has troops in Afghanistan with us now.

Israel is our strongest and best ally in the Middle East. We have got to assure them that we will never allow a second Holocaust, despite, again, warnings from Iran and any other country that would seek to destroy Israel, that that is what they would like to see. We will support Israel. A two-state solution, building our embassy, also, in Jerusalem, those things that we look forward to being able to accomplish, with this peace-seeking nation, and they have a track record of being able to forge these peace agreements. They succeeded with Jordan. They succeeded with Egypt. I\u2019m sure that we\u2019re going to see more success there, also. It\u2019s got to be a commitment of the United States of America, though.

In fairness to Secretary Rice, she\u2019s trying to turn it around now in the seventh or eighth year. Here\u2019s what the president said when we said no. He insisted on elections on the West Bank, when I said, and others said, and Barack Obama said, \u201cBig mistake. Hamas will win. You\u2019ll legitimize them.\u201d What happened? Hamas won. When we kicked \u2014 along with France, we kicked Hezbollah out of Lebanon, I said and Barack said, \u201cMove NATO forces in there. Fill the vacuum, because if you don\u2019t know \u2014 if you don\u2019t, Hezbollah will control it.\u201d Now what\u2019s happened? Hezbollah is a legitimate part of the government in the country immediately to the north of Israel. The fact of the matter is, the policy of this administration has been an abject failure. And speaking of freedom being on the march, the only thing on the march is Iran. It\u2019s closer to a bomb. Its proxies now have a major stake in Lebanon, as well as in the Gaza Strip with Hamas.

There have been huge blunders in the war. There have been huge blunders throughout this administration, as there are with every administration.

John McCain voted against a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty that every Republican has supported. John McCain has opposed amending the Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty with an amendment to allow for inspections. John McCain has not been \u2014 has not been the kind of supporter for dealing with \u2014 and let me put it another way. My time is almost up. Barack Obama, first thing he did when he came to the United States Senate, new senator, reached across the aisle to my colleague, Dick Lugar, a Republican, and said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something about keeping nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists.\u201d They put together a piece of legislation that, in fact, was serious and real.

A policy that would in fact engage our allies in making sure that we knew we were acting on the same page and not dictating. And a policy that would reject the Bush Doctrine of preemption and regime change and replace it with a doctrine of prevention and cooperation and, ladies and gentlemen, this is the biggest ticket item that we have in this election. This is the most important election you will ever, ever have voted in, any of you, since 1932.

As we discuss ANWR there, at least we can agree to disagree on that one. I will keep pushing him on ANWR. I have so appreciated he has never asked me to check my opinions at the door and he wants a deliberative debate and healthy debate so we can make good policy. What I would do also, if that were to ever happen, though, is to continue the good work he is so committed to of putting government back on the side of the people and get rid of the greed and corruption on Wall Street and in Washington. I think we need a little bit of reality from Wasilla Main Street there, brought to Washington, DC. So that people there can understand how the average working class family is viewing bureaucracy in the federal government and Congress, and the inaction of Congress. Just everyday, working-class Americans saying, you know, government, just get out of my way.

You mentioned education and I\u2019m glad that you did. I know education you are passionate about with your wife being a teacher for 30 years, and god bless her. Her reward is in heaven, right? I say, too, with education, America needs to be putting a lot more focus on that and our schools have got to be really ramped up in terms of the funding that they are deserving. Teachers needed to be paid more. I come from a house full of school teachers. My grandma was, my dad who is in the audience today, he\u2019s a schoolteacher, had been for many years. My brother, who I think is the best schoolteacher in the year, and here\u2019s a shout-out to all those third graders at Gladys Wood Elementary School, you get extra credit for watching the debate. Education in America has been in some sense in some of our states just accepted to be a little bit lax, and we have got to increase the standards. No Child Left Behind was implemented. It\u2019s not doing the job though. We need flexibility in No Child Left Behind. We need to put more of an emphasis on the profession of teaching. We need to make sure that education in either one of our agendas, I think, absolute top of the line. My kids as public school participants right now, it\u2019s near and dear to my heart.

I have a history of getting things done in the United States Senate. John McCain would acknowledge that. My record shows that on controversial issues. I would be the point person for the legislative initiatives in the United States Congress for our administration. I would also, when asked if I wanted a portfolio, my response was, no. But Barack Obama indicated to me he wanted me with him to help him govern. So every major decision he\u2019ll be making, I\u2019ll be sitting in the room to give him my best advice. He\u2019s president, not me, I\u2019ll give my best advice.

About times and Todd and our marriage in our past where we didn\u2019t have health insurance and we know what other Americans are going through as they sit around the kitchen table and try to figure out, how are they going to pay out-of-pocket for health care?

That worldview that says that America is a nation of exceptionalism. And we are to be that shining city on a hill, as President Reagan so beautifully said, that we are a beacon of hope and that we are unapologetic here. We are not perfect as a nation. But together, we represent a perfect ideal, and that is democracy and tolerance and freedom and equal rights.

And I appreciate, too, Senator Biden, getting to meet you, finally, also, and getting to debate with you. And I would like more opportunity for this. I like being able to answer these tough questions without the filter, even, of the mainstream media kind of telling viewers what they\u2019ve just heard. I\u2019d rather be able to just speak to the American people like we just did. And it\u2019s so important that the American people know of the choices that they have on November 4th. I want to assure you that John McCain and I, we\u2019re going to fight for America. We\u2019re going to fight for the middle-class, average, everyday American family like mine. I\u2019ve been there. I know what the hurts are. I know what the challenges are. And, thank God, I know what the joys are, too, of living in America. We are so blessed. And I\u2019ve always been proud to be an American. And so has John McCain. We have to fight for our freedoms, also, economic and our national security freedoms. It was Ronald Reagan who said that freedom is always just one generation away from extinction. We don\u2019t pass it to our children in the bloodstream; we have to fight for it and protect it, and then hand it to them so that they shall do the same, or we\u2019re going to find ourselves spending our sunset years telling our children and our children\u2019s children about a time in America, back in the day, when men and women were free. We will fight for it, and there is only one man in this race who has really ever fought for you, and that\u2019s Senator John McCain."}

Look, folks, this is the most important election you\u2019ve ever voted in your entire life. No one can deny that the last eight years, we\u2019ve been dug into a very deep hole here at home with regard to our economy, and abroad in terms of our credibility. And there\u2019s a need for fundamental change in our economic philosophy, as well as our foreign policy. And Barack Obama and I don\u2019t measure progress toward that change based on whether or not we cut more regulations and how well CEOs are doing, or giving another $4 billion in tax breaks to the Exxon Mobils of the world. We measure progress in America based on whether or not someone can pay their mortgage, whether or not they can send their kid to college, whether or not they\u2019re able to, when they send their child, like we have abroad \u2014 or I\u2019m about to, abroad \u2014 and John has as well, I might add \u2014 to fight, that they are the best equipped and they have everything they need. And when they come home, they\u2019re guaranteed that they have the best health care and the best education possible. You know, in the neighborhood I grew up in, it was all about dignity and respect. A neighborhood like most of you grew up in. And in that neighborhood, it was filled with women and men, mothers and fathers who taught their children if they believed in themselves, if they were honest, if they worked hard, if they loved their country, they could accomplish anything. We believed it, and we did. That\u2019s why Barack Obama and I are running, to re-establish that certitude in our neighborhoods. Ladies and gentlemen, my dad used to have an expression. He\u2019d say, \u201cchamp, when you get knocked down, get up.\u201d Well, it\u2019s time for America to get up together. America\u2019s ready, you\u2019re ready, I\u2019m ready, and Barack Obama is ready to be the next president of the United States of America. May God bless all of you, and most of all, for both of us, selfishly, may God protect our troops."}

I want to first, obviously, thank Belmont University, Tom, thank you, and to all of you who are participating tonight and those of you who sent e-mail questions in. I think everybody knows now we are in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And a lot of you I think are worried about your jobs, your pensions, your retirement accounts, your ability to send your child or your grandchild to college. And I believe this is a final verdict on the failed economic policies of the last eight years, strongly promoted by President Bush and supported by Senator McCain, that essentially said that we should strip away regulations, consumer protections, let the market run wild, and prosperity would rain down on all of us. It hasn\u2019t worked out that way. And so now we\u2019ve got to take some decisive action. Now, step one was a rescue package that was passed last week. We\u2019ve got to make sure that works properly. And that means strong oversight, making sure that investors, taxpayers are getting their money back and treated as investors. It means that we are cracking down on CEOs and making sure that they\u2019re not getting bonuses or golden parachutes as a consequence of this package. And, in fact, we just found out that AIG, a company that got a bailout, just a week after they got help went on a $400,000 junket. And I\u2019ll tell you what, the Treasury should demand that money back and those executives should be fired. But that\u2019s only step one. The middle-class need a rescue package. And that means tax cuts for the middle-class. It means help for homeowners so that they can stay in their homes. It means that we are helping state and local governments set up road projects and bridge projects that keep people in their jobs. And then long-term we\u2019ve got to fix our health care system, we\u2019ve got to fix our energy system that is putting such an enormous burden on families. You need somebody working for you and you\u2019ve got to have somebody in Washington who is thinking about the middle class and not just those who can afford to hire lobbyists."}

And Senator Obama, it\u2019s good to be with you at a town hall meeting. And, Alan (ph), thank you for your question. You go to the heart of America\u2019s worries tonight. Americans are angry, they\u2019re upset, and they\u2019re a little fearful. It\u2019s our job to fix the problem. Now, I have a plan to fix this problem and it has got to do with energy independence. We\u2019ve got to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don\u2019t want us very \u2014 like us very much. We have to keep Americans\u2019 taxes low. All Americans\u2019 taxes low. Let\u2019s not raise taxes on anybody today. We obviously have to stop this spending spree that\u2019s going on in Washington. Do you know that we\u2019ve laid a $10 trillion debt on these young Americans who are here with us tonight, $500 billion of it we owe to China? We\u2019ve got to have a package of reforms and it has got to lead to reform prosperity and peace in the world. And I think that this problem has become so severe, as you know, that we\u2019re going to have to do something about home values. You know that home values of retirees continues to decline and people are no longer able to afford their mortgage payments. As president of the United States, Alan, I would order the secretary of the treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America and renegotiate at the new value of those homes \u2014 at the diminished value of those homes and let people be able to make those \u2014 be able to make those payments and stay in their homes. Is it expensive? Yes. But we all know, my friends, until we stabilize home values in America, we\u2019re never going to start turning around and creating jobs and fixing our economy. And we\u2019ve got to give some trust and confidence back to America. I know how the do that, my friends. And it\u2019s my proposal, it\u2019s not Senator Obama\u2019s proposal, it\u2019s not President Bush\u2019s proposal. But I know how to get America working again, restore our economy and take care of working Americans. Thank you."}

I like Meg Whitman, she knows what it\u2019s like to be out there in the marketplace. She knows how to create jobs. Meg Whitman was CEO of a company that started with 12 people and is now 1.3 million people in America make their living off eBay. Maybe somebody here has done a little business with them. But the point is it\u2019s going to have to be somebody who inspires trust and confidence. Because the problem in America today to a large extent, Tom, is that we don\u2019t have trust and confidence in our institutions because of the corruption on Wall Street and the greed and excess and the cronyism in Washington, D.C."}

But there are other folks out there. The key is making sure that the next treasury secretary understands that it\u2019s not enough just to help those at the top. Prosperity is not just going to trickle down. We\u2019ve got to help the middle class. And we\u2019ve \u2014 you know, Senator McCain and I have some fundamental disagreements on the economy, starting with Senator McCain\u2019s statement earlier that he thought the fundamentals of the economy were sound. Part of the problem here is that for many of you, wages and incomes have flat-lined. For many of you, it is getting harder and harder to save, harder and harder to retire. And that\u2019s why, for example, on tax policy, what I want to do is provide a middle class tax cut to 95 percent of working Americans, those who are working two jobs, people who are not spending enough time with their kids, because they are struggling to make ends meet. Senator McCain is right that we\u2019ve got to stabilize housing prices. But underlying that is loss of jobs and loss of income. That\u2019s something that the next treasury secretary is going to have to work on."}

S. SENATOR BARACK OBAMA (IL)DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE","Moderators":"TOM BROKAW","Speaker":"MCCAIN","Text":"Well, thank you, Oliver, and that\u2019s an excellent question, because as you just described it, bailout, when I believe that it\u2019s rescue, because \u2014 because of the greed and excess in Washington and Wall Street, Main Street was paying a very heavy price, and we know that. I left my campaign and suspended it to go back to Washington to make sure that there were additional protections for the taxpayer in the form of good oversight, in the form of taxpayers being the first to be paid back when our economy recovers \u2014 and it will recover \u2014 and a number of other measures. But you know, one of the real catalysts, really the match that lit this fire was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I\u2019ll bet you, you may never even have heard of them before this crisis. But you know, they\u2019re the ones that, with the encouragement of Senator Obama and his cronies and his friends in Washington, that went out and made all these risky loans, gave them to people that could never afford to pay back. And you know, there were some of us that stood up two years ago and said we\u2019ve got to enact legislation to fix this. We\u2019ve got to stop this greed and excess. Meanwhile, the Democrats in the Senate and some \u2014 and some members of Congress defended what Fannie and Freddie were doing. They resisted any change. Meanwhile, they were getting all kinds of money in campaign contributions. Senator Obama was the second highest recipient of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac money in history \u2014 in history. So this rescue package means that we will stabilize markets, we will shore up these institutions. But it\u2019s not enough. That\u2019s why we\u2019re going to have to go out into the housing market and we\u2019re going to have to buy up these bad loans and we\u2019re going to have to stabilize home values, and that way, Americans, like Alan, can realize the American dream and stay in their home. But Fannie and Freddie were the catalysts, the match that started this forest fire. There were some of us \u2014 there were some of us that stood up against it. There were others who took a hike."}

S. SENATOR BARACK OBAMA (IL)DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE","Moderators":"TOM BROKAW","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"Well, Oliver, first, let me tell you what\u2019s in the rescue package for you. Right now, the credit markets are frozen up and what that means, as a practical matter, is that small businesses and some large businesses just can\u2019t get loans. If they can\u2019t get a loan, that means that they can\u2019t make payroll. If they can\u2019t make payroll, then they may end up having to shut their doors and lay people off. And if you imagine just one company trying to deal with that, now imagine a million companies all across the country. So it could end up having an adverse effect on everybody, and that\u2019s why we had to take action. But we shouldn\u2019t have been there in the first place. Now, I\u2019ve got to correct a little bit of Senator McCain\u2019s history, not surprisingly. Let\u2019s, first of all, understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system. Senator McCain, as recently as March, bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator. On the other hand, two years ago, I said that we\u2019ve got a sub-prime lending crisis that has to be dealt with. I wrote to Secretary Paulson, I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, and told them this is something we have to deal with, and nobody did anything about it. A year ago, I went to Wall Street and said we\u2019ve got to reregulate, and nothing happened. And Senator McCain during that period said that we should keep on deregulating because that\u2019s how the free enterprise system works. Now, with respect to Fannie Mae, what Senator McCain didn\u2019t mention is the fact that this bill that he talked about wasn\u2019t his own bill. He jumped on it a year after it had been introduced and it never got passed. And I never promoted Fannie Mae. In fact, Senator McCain\u2019s campaign chairman\u2019s firm was a lobbyist on behalf of Fannie Mae, not me. So \u2014 but, look, you\u2019re not interested in hearing politicians pointing fingers. What you\u2019re interested in is trying to figure out, how is this going to impact you? This is not the end of the process; this is the beginning of the process. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s going to be so important for us to work with homeowners to make sure that they can stay in their homes. The secretary already has the power to do that in the rescue package, but it hasn\u2019t been exercised yet. And the next president has to make sure that the next Treasury secretary is thinking about how to strengthen you as a home buyer, you as a homeowner, and not simply think about bailing out banks on Wall Street."}

We\u2019re going to have to coordinate with other countries to make sure that whatever actions we take work. But most importantly, we\u2019re going to have to help ordinary families be able to stay in their homes, make sure that they can pay their bills, deal with critical issues like health care and energy, and we\u2019re going to have to change the culture in Washington so that lobbyists and special interests aren\u2019t driving the process and your voices aren\u2019t being drowned out."}

My friend, I\u2019d like you to see the letter that a group of senators and I wrote warning exactly of this crisis. Senator Obama\u2019s name was not on that letter. The point is \u2014 the point is that we can fix our economy. Americans\u2019 workers are the best in the world. They\u2019re the fundamental aspect of America\u2019s economy.

S. SENATOR BARACK OBAMA (IL)DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE","Moderators":"TOM BROKAW","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"Well, look, I understand your frustration and your cynicism, because while you\u2019ve been carrying out your responsibilities \u2014 most of the people here, you\u2019ve got a family budget. If less money is coming in, you end up making cuts. Maybe you don\u2019t go out to dinner as much. Maybe you put off buying a new car. That\u2019s not what happens in Washington. And you\u2019re right. There is a lot of blame to go around. But I think it\u2019s important just to remember a little bit of history. When George Bush came into office, we had surpluses. And now we have half-a-trillion-dollar deficit annually. When George Bush came into office, our debt \u2014 national debt was around $5 trillion. It\u2019s now over $10 trillion. We\u2019ve almost doubled it. And so while it\u2019s true that nobody\u2019s completely innocent here, we have had over the last eight years the biggest increases in deficit spending and national debt in our history. And Senator McCain voted for four out of five of those George Bush budgets. So here\u2019s what I would do. I\u2019m going to spend some money on the key issues that we\u2019ve got to work on. You know, you may have seen your health care premiums go up. We\u2019ve got to reform health care to help you and your budget. We are going to have to deal with energy because we can\u2019t keep on borrowing from the Chinese and sending money to Saudi Arabia. We are mortgaging our children\u2019s future. We\u2019ve got to have a different energy plan. We\u2019ve got to invest in college affordability. So we\u2019re going to have to make some investments, but we\u2019ve also got to make spending cuts. And what I\u2019ve proposed, you\u2019ll hear Senator McCain say, well, he\u2019s proposing a whole bunch of new spending, but actually I\u2019m cutting more than I\u2019m spending so that it will be a net spending cut. The key is whether or not we\u2019ve got priorities that are working for you as opposed to those who have been dictating the policy in Washington lately, and that\u2019s mostly lobbyists and special interests. We\u2019ve got to put an end to that."}

And I can see why you feel that cynicism and mistrust, because the system in Washington is broken. And I have been a consistent reformer. I have advocated and taken on the special interests, whether they be the big money people by reaching across the aisle and working with Senator Feingold on campaign finance reform, whether it being a variety of other issues, working with Senator Lieberman on trying to address climate change. I have a clear record of bipartisanship. The situation today cries out for bipartisanship. Senator Obama has never taken on his leaders of his party on a single issue. And we need to reform. And so let\u2019s look at our records as well as our rhetoric. That\u2019s really part of your mistrust here. And now I suggest that maybe you go to some of these organizations that are the watchdogs of what we do, like the Citizens Against Government Waste or the National Taxpayers Union or these other organizations that watch us all the time. I don\u2019t expect you to watch every vote. And you know what you\u2019ll find? This is the most liberal big-spending record in the United States Senate. I have fought against excessive spending and outrages. I have fought to reduce the earmarks and eliminate them. Do you know that Senator Obama has voted for \u2014 is proposing $860 billion of new spending now? New spending. Do you know that he voted for every increase in spending that I saw come across the floor of the United States Senate while we were working to eliminate these pork barrel earmarks? He voted for nearly a billion dollars in pork barrel earmark projects, including, by the way, $3 million for an overhead projector at a planetarium in Chicago, Illinois. My friends, do we need to spend that kind of money? I think you have to look at my record and you have to look at his. Then you have to look at our proposals for our economy, not $860 billion in new spending, but for the kinds of reforms that keep people in their jobs, get middle-income Americans working again, and getting our economy moving again. You\u2019re going to be examining our proposals tonight and in the future, and energy independence is a way to do that, is one of them. And drilling offshore and nuclear power are two vital elements of that. And I\u2019ve been supporting those and I know how to fix this economy, and eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, and stop sending $700 billion a year overseas."}

We\u2019re going to have to sit down across the table, Republican and Democrat, as we did in 1983 between Ronald Reagan and Tip O\u2019Neill. I know how to do that. I have a clear record of reaching across the aisle, whether it be Joe Lieberman or Russ Feingold or Ted Kennedy or others. That\u2019s my clear record. We can work on nuclear power plants. Build a whole bunch of them, create millions of new jobs. We have to have all of the above, alternative fuels, wind, tide, solar, natural gas, clean coal technology. All of these things we can do as Americans and we can take on this mission and we can overcome it. My friends, some of this $700 billion ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations. As far as health care is concerned, obviously, everyone is struggling to make sure that they can afford their premiums and that they can have affordable and available health care. That\u2019s the next issue. But we can do them all at once. There\u2019s no \u2014 and we have to do them all at once. All three you mentioned are compelling national security requirements."}

S. SENATOR BARACK OBAMA (IL)DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE","Moderators":"TOM BROKAW","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"We\u2019re going to have to prioritize, just like a family has to prioritize. Now, I\u2019ve listed the things that I think have to be at the top of the list. Energy we have to deal with today, because you\u2019re paying $3.80 here in Nashville for gasoline, and it could go up. And it\u2019s a strain on your family budget, but it\u2019s also bad for our national security, because countries like Russia and Venezuela and, you know, in some cases, countries like Iran, are benefiting from higher oil prices. So we\u2019ve got to deal with that right away. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve called for an investment of $15 billion a year over 10 years. Our goal should be, in 10 year\u2019s time, we are free of dependence on Middle Eastern oil. And we can do it. Now, when JFK said we\u2019re going to the Moon in 10 years, nobody was sure how to do it, but we understood that, if the American people make a decision to do something, it gets done. So that would be priority number one. Health care is priority number two, because that broken health care system is bad not only for families, but it\u2019s making our businesses less competitive. And, number three, we\u2019ve got to deal with education so that our young people are competitive in a global economy. But just one point I want to make, Tom. Senator McCain mentioned looking at our records. We do need to look at our records. Senator McCain likes to talk about earmarks a lot. And that\u2019s important. I want to go line by line through every item in the federal budget and eliminate programs that don\u2019t work and make sure that those that do work, work better and cheaper. But understand this - We also have to look at where some of our tax revenues are going. So when Senator McCain proposes a $300 billion tax cut, a continuation not only of the Bush tax cuts, but an additional $200 billion that he\u2019s going to give to big corporations, including big oil companies, $4 billion worth, that\u2019s money out of the system. And so we\u2019ve got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that they\u2019re working for you. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do as president of the United States."}

I first proposed a long time ago that we would have to examine every agency and every bureaucracy of government. And we\u2019re going to have to eliminate those that aren\u2019t working. I know a lot of them that aren\u2019t working. One of them is in defense spending, because I\u2019ve taken on some of the defense contractors. I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion in a deal for an Air Force tanker that was done in a corrupt fashion. I believe that we have to eliminate the earmarks. And sometimes those projects, not \u2014 not the overhead projector that Senator Obama asked for, but some of them that are really good projects, will have \u2014 will have to be eliminated, as well. And they\u2019ll have to undergo the same scrutiny that all projects should in competition with others. So we\u2019re going to have to tell the American people that spending is going to have to be cut in America. And I recommend a spending freeze that \u2014 except for defense, Veterans Affairs, and some other vital programs, we\u2019ll just have to have across-the-board freeze. And some of those programs may not grow as much as we would like for them to, but we can establish priorities with full transparency, with full knowledge of the American people, and full consultation, not done behind closed doors and shoving earmarks in the middle of the night into programs that we don\u2019t even \u2014 sometimes we don\u2019t even know about until months later. And, by the way, I want to go back a second. Look, we can attack health care and energy at the same time. We\u2019re not \u2014 we\u2019re not \u2014 we\u2019re not rifle shots here. We are Americans. We can, with the participation of all Americans, work together and solve these problems together. Frankly, I\u2019m not going to tell that person without health insurance that, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you\u2019ll have to wait.\u201d I\u2019m going to tell you Americans we\u2019ll get to work right away and we\u2019ll get to work together, and we can get them all done, because that\u2019s what America has been doing."}

And President Bush did some smart things at the outset, but one of the opportunities that was missed was, when he spoke to the American people, he said, \u201cGo out and shop.\u201d That wasn\u2019t the kind of call to service that I think the American people were looking for. And so it\u2019s important to understand that the \u2014 I think the American people are hungry for the kind of leadership that is going to tackle these problems not just in government, but outside of government. And let\u2019s take the example of energy, which we already spoke about. There is going to be the need for each and every one of us to start thinking about how we use energy. I believe in the need for increased oil production. We\u2019re going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling. It includes telling the oil companies, that currently have 68 million acres that they\u2019re not using, that either you use them or you lose them. We\u2019re going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy. But each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes, in our buildings. And one of the things I want to do is make sure that we\u2019re providing incentives so that you can buy a fuel efficient car that\u2019s made right here in the United States of America, not in Japan or South Korea, making sure that you are able to weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient. And that\u2019s going to require effort from each and every one of us. And the last point I just want to make. I think the young people of America are especially interested in how they can serve, and that\u2019s one of the reasons why I\u2019m interested in doubling the Peace Corps, making sure that we are creating a volunteer corps all across this country that can be involved in their community, involved in military service, so that military families and our troops are not the only ones bearing the burden of renewing America. That\u2019s something that all of us have to be involved with and that requires some leadership from Washington."}

We\u2019ve got to show that we\u2019ve got good habits, because if we\u2019re running up trillion dollar debts that we\u2019re passing on to the next generation, then a lot of people are going to think, \u201cWell, you know what? There\u2019s easy money out there.\u201d It means \u2014 and I have to, again, repeat this. It means looking (ph) at the spending side, but also at the revenue side. I mean, Senator McCain has been talking tough about earmarks, and that\u2019s good, but earmarks account for about $18 billion of our budget. Now, when Senator McCain is proposing tax cuts that would give the average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts, that\u2019s not sharing a burden. And so part of the problem, I think, for a lot of people who are listening here tonight is they don\u2019t feel as if they are sharing the burden with other folks. I mean, you know, it\u2019s tough to ask a teacher who\u2019s making $30,000 or $35,000 a year to tighten her belt when people who are making much more than her are living pretty high on the hog. And that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s important for the president to set a tone that says all of us are going to contribute, all of us are going to make sacrifices, and it means that, yes, we may have to cut some spending, although I disagree with Senator McCain about an across-the- board freeze. That\u2019s an example of an unfair burden sharing. That\u2019s using a hatchet to cut the federal budget. I want to use a scalpel so that people who need help are getting help and those of us, like myself and Senator McCain, who don\u2019t need help, aren\u2019t getting it. That\u2019s how we make sure that everybody is willing to make a few sacrifices."}

There has been five or six of them and if you wait long enough, there will probably be another one. But he wants to raise taxes. My friends, the last president to raise taxes during tough economic times was Herbert Hoover, and he practiced protectionism as well, which I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get to at some point. You know, last year up to this time, we\u2019ve lost 700,000 jobs in America. The only bright spot is that over 300,000 jobs have been created by small businesses. Senator Obama\u2019s secret that you don\u2019t know is that his tax increases will increase taxes on 50 percent of small business revenue. Small businesses across America will have to cut jobs and will have their taxes increase and won\u2019t be able to hire because of Senator Obama\u2019s tax policies. You know, he said some time ago, he said he would forgo his tax increases if the economy was bad. I\u2019ve got some news, Senator Obama, the news is bad. So let\u2019s not raise anybody\u2019s taxes, my friends, and make it be very clear to you I am not in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy. I am in favor of leaving the tax rates alone and reducing the tax burden on middle-income Americans by doubling your tax exemption for every child from $3,500 to $7,000. To giving every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit and go out and get the health insurance you want rather than mandates and fines for small businesses, as Senator Obama\u2019s plan calls for. And let\u2019s create jobs and let\u2019s get our economy going again. And let\u2019s not raise anybody\u2019s taxes."}

We\u2019re going to have a lot of work to do, so I can\u2019t guarantee that we\u2019re going to do it in the next two years, but I\u2019d like to do in the my first term as president. But I think it\u2019s important to understand, we\u2019re not going to solve Social Security and Medicare unless we understand the rest of our tax policies. And you know, Senator McCain, I think the \u201cStraight Talk Express\u201d lost a wheel on that one. So let\u2019s be clear about my tax plan and Senator McCain\u2019s, because we\u2019re not going to be able to deal with entitlements unless we understand the revenues coming in. I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of Americans, 95 percent. If you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year, you will not see a single dime of your taxes go up. If you make $200,000 a year or less, your taxes will go down. Now, Senator McCain talks about small businesses. Only a few percent of small businesses make more than $250,000 a year. So the vast majority of small businesses would get a tax cut under my plan. And we provide a 50 percent tax credit so that they can buy health insurance for their workers, because there are an awful lot of small businesses that I meet across America that want to do right by their workers but they just can\u2019t afford it. Some small business owners, a lot of them, can\u2019t even afford health insurance for themselves. Now, in contrast, Senator McCain wants to give a $300 billion tax cut, $200 billion of it to the largest corporations and a hundred thousand of it \u2014 a hundred billion of it going to people like CEOs on Wall Street. He wants to give average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts. That is not fair. And it doesn\u2019t work. Now, if we get our tax policies right so that they\u2019re good for the middle class, if we reverse the policies of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place and that Senator McCain supported, then we are going to be in a position to deal with Social Security and deal with Medicare, because we will have a health care plan that actually works for you, reduces spending and costs over the long term, and Social Security that is stable and solvent for all Americans and not just some."}

I saw it done with our \u2014 our wonderful Ronald Reagan, a conservative from California, and the liberal Democrat Tip O\u2019Neill from Massachusetts. That\u2019s what we need more of, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done in Washington. Senator Obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue. I\u2019ve taken them on. I\u2019m not too popular sometimes with my own party, much less his. So Medicare, it\u2019s going to be a little tougher. It\u2019s going to be a little tougher because we\u2019re talking about very complex and difficult issues. My friends, what we have to do with Medicare is have a commission, have the smartest people in America come together, come up with recommendations, and then, like the base-closing commission idea we had, then we should have Congress vote up or down. Let\u2019s not let them fool with it anymore. There\u2019s too much special interests and too many lobbyists working there.

Senator Obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts. That\u2019s his record. When he ran for the United States Senate from Illinois, he said he would have a middle-income tax cut. You know he came to the Senate and never once proposed legislation to do that? So let\u2019s look at our record. I\u2019ve fought higher taxes. I have fought excess spending. I have fought to reform government. Let\u2019s look at our records, my friends, and then listen to my vision for the future of America. And we\u2019ll get our economy going again. And our best days are ahead of us."}

Now, how \u2014 what\u2019s \u2014 what\u2019s the best way of fixing it? Nuclear power. Senator Obama says that it has to be safe or disposable or something like that. Look, I \u2014 I was on Navy ships that had nuclear power plants. Nuclear power is safe, and it\u2019s clean, and it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs. And \u2014 and I know that we can reprocess the spent nuclear fuel. The Japanese, the British, the French do it. And we can do it, too. Senator Obama has opposed that. We can move forward, and clean up our climate, and develop green technologies, and alternate \u2014 alternative energies for \u2014 for hybrid, for hydrogen, for battery-powered cars, so that we can clean up our environment and at the same time get our economy going by creating millions of jobs.

S. SENATOR BARACK OBAMA (IL)DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE","Moderators":"TOM BROKAW","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"This is one of the biggest challenges of our times. And it is absolutely critical that we understand this is not just a challenge, it\u2019s an opportunity, because if we create a new energy economy, we can create five million new jobs, easily, here in the United States. It can be an engine that drives us into the future the same way the computer was the engine for economic growth over the last couple of decades. And we can do it, but we\u2019re going to have to make an investment. The same way the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out, for defense purposes, how to communicate, we\u2019ve got to understand that this is a national security issue, as well. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to make some investments and I\u2019ve called for investments in solar, wind, geothermal. Contrary to what Senator McCain keeps on saying, I favor nuclear power as one component of our overall energy mix. But this is another example where I think it is important to look at the record. Senator McCain and I actually agree on something. He said a while back that the big problem with energy is that for 30 years, politicians in Washington haven\u2019t done anything. What Senator McCain doesn\u2019t mention is he\u2019s been there 26 of them. And during that time, he voted 23 times against alternative fuels, 23 times. So it\u2019s easy to talk about this stuff during a campaign, but it\u2019s important for us to understand that it requires a sustained effort from the next president. One last point I want to make on energy. Senator McCain talks a lot about drilling, and that\u2019s important, but we have three percent of the world\u2019s oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world\u2019s oil. So what that means is that we can\u2019t simply drill our way out of the problem. And we\u2019re not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global warming. We\u2019re going to have to come up with alternatives, and that means that the United States government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like China that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week. We\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re giving them the energy that they need or helping them to create the energy that they need."}

I think once it gets into productive stages, that we ought to, obviously, turn it over to the private sector. By the way, my friends, I know you grow a little weary with this back-and-forth. It was an energy bill on the floor of the Senate loaded down with goodies, billions for the oil companies, and it was sponsored by Bush and Cheney. You know who voted for it? You might never know. That one. You know who voted against it? Me. I have fought time after time against these pork barrel \u2014 these bills that come to the floor and they have all kinds of goodies and all kinds of things in them for everybody and they buy off the votes. I vote against them, my friends. I vote against them. But the point is, also, on oil drilling, oil drilling offshore now is vital so that we can bridge the gap. We can bridge the gap between imported oil, which is a national security issue, as well as any other, and it will reduce the price of a barrel of oil, because when people know there\u2019s a greater supply, then the cost of that will go down. That\u2019s fundamental economics. We\u2019ve got to drill offshore, my friends, and we\u2019ve got to do it now, and we can do it. And as far as nuclear power is concerned, again, look at the record. Senator Obama has approved storage and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. And I\u2019ll stop, Tom, and you didn\u2019t even wave.

S. SENATOR BARACK OBAMA (IL)DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE","Moderators":"TOM BROKAW","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"Well, you know, as I travel around the country, this is one of the single most frequently asked issues that I get, is the issue of health care. It is breaking family budgets. I can\u2019t tell you how many people I meet who don\u2019t have health insurance. If you\u2019ve got health insurance, most of you have seen your premiums double over the last eight years. And your co-payments and deductibles have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alone. If you\u2019re a small business, it\u2019s a crushing burden. So one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing. So here\u2019s what I would do. If you\u2019ve got health care already, and probably the majority of you do, then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it. You can keep your choice of doctor. We\u2019re going to work with your employer to lower the cost of your premiums by up to $2,500 a year. And we\u2019re going to do it by investing in prevention. We\u2019re going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital. That will reduce medical errors and reduce costs. If you don\u2019t have health insurance, you\u2019re going to be able to buy the same kind of insurance that Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees. Because there\u2019s a huge pool, we can drop the costs. And nobody will be excluded for pre-existing conditions, which is a huge problem. Now, Senator McCain has a different kind of approach. He says that he\u2019s going to give you a $5,000 tax credit. What he doesn\u2019t tell you is that he is going to tax your employer-based health care benefits for the first time ever. So what one hand giveth, the other hand taketh away. He would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure you\u2019re not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered. And that is fundamentally the wrong way to go. In fact, just today business organizations like the United States Chamber of Commerce, which generally are pretty supportive of Republicans, said that this would lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system. That, I don\u2019t think, is the kind of change that we need. We\u2019ve got to have somebody who is fighting for patients and making sure that you get decent, affordable health care. And that\u2019s something that I\u2019m committed to doing as president."}

You really identified one of the really major challenges that America faces. Co-payments go up, costs go up, skyrocketing costs, which make people less and less able to afford health insurance in America. And we need to do all of the things that are necessary to make it more efficient. Let\u2019s put health records online, that will reduce medical errors, as they call them. Let\u2019s have community health centers. Let\u2019s have walk-in clinics. Let\u2019s do a lot of things to impose efficiencies. But what is at stake here in this health care issue is the fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama. As you notice, he starts talking about government. He starts saying, government will do this and government will do that, and then government will, and he\u2019ll impose mandates. If you\u2019re a small business person and you don\u2019t insure your employees, Senator Obama will fine you. Will fine you. That\u2019s remarkable. If you\u2019re a parent and you\u2019re struggling to get health insurance for your children, Senator Obama will fine you. I want to give every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit. They can take it anywhere, across state lines. Why not? Don\u2019t we go across state lines when we purchase other things in America? Of course it\u2019s OK to go across state lines because in Arizona they may offer a better plan that suits you best than it does here in Tennessee. And if you do the math, those people who have employer-based health benefits, if you put the tax on it and you have what\u2019s left over and you add $5,000 that you\u2019re going to get as a refundable tax credit, do the math, 95 percent of the American people will have increased funds to go out and buy the insurance of their choice and to shop around and to get \u2014 all of those people will be covered except for those who have these gold-plated Cadillac kinds of policies. You know, like hair transplants, I might need one of those myself. But the point is that we have got to give people choice in America and not mandate things on them and give them the ability. Every parent I know would acquire health insurance for their children if they could. Obviously small business people want to give their employees health insurance. Of course they all want to do that. We\u2019ve got to give them the wherewithal to do it. We can do it by giving them, as a start, a $5,000 refundable tax credit to go around and get the health insurance policy of their choice."}

S. SENATOR BARACK OBAMA (IL)DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE","Moderators":"TOM BROKAW","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"Well, I think it should be a right for every American. In a country as wealthy as ours, for us to have people who are going bankrupt because they can\u2019t pay their medical bills \u2014 for my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because they\u2019re saying that this may be a pre-existing condition and they don\u2019t have to pay her treatment, there\u2019s something fundamentally wrong about that. So let me \u2014 let me just talk about this fundamental difference. And, Tom, I know that we\u2019re under time constraints, but Senator McCain through a lot of stuff out there. Number one, let me just repeat, if you\u2019ve got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it. All I\u2019m going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it. You\u2019ll still have choice of doctor. There\u2019s no mandate involved. Small businesses are not going to have a mandate. What we\u2019re going to give you is a 50 percent tax credit to help provide health care for those that you need. Now, it\u2019s true that I say that you are going to have to make sure that your child has health care, because children are relatively cheap to insure and we don\u2019t want them going to the emergency room for treatable illnesses like asthma. And when Senator McCain says that he wants to provide children health care, what he doesn\u2019t mention is he voted against the expansion of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program that is responsible for making sure that so many children who didn\u2019t have previously health insurance have it now. Now, the final point I\u2019ll make on this whole issue of government intrusion and mandates \u2014 it is absolutely true that I think it is important for government to crack down on insurance companies that are cheating their customers, that don\u2019t give you the fine print, so you end up thinking that you\u2019re paying for something and, when you finally get sick and you need it, you\u2019re not getting it. And the reason that it\u2019s a problem to go shopping state by state, you know what insurance companies will do? They will find a state \u2014 maybe Arizona, maybe another state \u2014 where there are no requirements for you to get cancer screenings, where there are no requirements for you to have to get pre-existing conditions, and they will all set up shop there. That\u2019s how in banking it works. Everybody goes to Delaware, because they\u2019ve got very \u2014 pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards. And in that situation, what happens is, is that the protections you have, the consumer protections that you need, you\u2019re not going to have available to you. That is a fundamental difference that I have with Senator McCain. He believes in deregulation in every circumstance. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been going through for the last eight years. It hasn\u2019t worked, and we need fundamental change."}

And that is one of the challenges that America faces. But having said that, America \u2014 and we\u2019ll hear a lot of criticism. I\u2019ve heard a lot of criticism about America, and our national security policy, and all that, and much of that criticism is justified. But the fact is, America is the greatest force for good in the history of the world. My friends, we have gone to all four corners of the Earth and shed American blood in defense, usually, of somebody else\u2019s freedom and our own. So we are peacemakers and we\u2019re peacekeepers. But the challenge is to know when the United States of American can beneficially effect the outcome of a crisis, when to go in and when not, when American military power is worth the expenditure of our most precious treasure. And that question can only be answered by someone with the knowledge and experience and the judgment, the judgment to know when our national security is not only at risk, but where the United States of America can make a difference in preventing genocide, in preventing the spread of terrorism, in doing the things that the United States has done, not always well, but we\u2019ve done because we\u2019re a nation of good. And I am convinced that my record, going back to my opposition from sending the Marines to Lebanon, to supporting our efforts in Kosovo and Bosnia and the first Gulf War, and my judgment, I think, is something that I\u2019m \u2014 a record that I\u2019m willing to stand on. Senator Obama was wrong about Iraq and the surge. He was wrong about Russia when they committed aggression against Georgia. And in his short career, he does not understand our national security challenges. We don\u2019t have time for on-the-job training, my friends."}

It\u2019s true. There are some things I don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9\/11, while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us. That was Senator McCain\u2019s judgment and it was the wrong judgment. When Senator McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq, he suggested it was going to be quick and easy, we\u2019d be greeted as liberators. That was the wrong judgment, and it\u2019s been costly to us. So one of the difficulties with Iraq is that it has put an enormous strain, first of all, on our troops, obviously, and they have performed heroically and honorably and we owe them an extraordinary debt of gratitude. But it\u2019s also put an enormous strain on our budget. We\u2019ve spent, so far, close to $700 billion and if we continue on the path that we\u2019re on, as Senator McCain is suggesting, it\u2019s going to go well over $1 trillion. We\u2019re spending $10 billion a month in Iraq at a time when the Iraqis have a $79 billion surplus, $79 billion. And we need that $10 billion a month here in the United States to put people back to work, to do all these wonderful things that Senator McCain suggested we should be doing, but has not yet explained how he would pay for. Now, Senator McCain and I do agree, this is the greatest nation on earth. We are a force of good in the world. But there has never been a nation in the history of the world that saw its economy decline and maintained its military superiority. And the strains that have been placed on our alliances around the world and the respect that\u2019s been diminished over the last eight years has constrained us being able to act on something like the genocide in Darfur, because we don\u2019t have the resources or the allies to do everything that we should be doing. That\u2019s going to change when I\u2019m president, but we can\u2019t change it unless we fundamentally change Senator McCain\u2019s and George Bush\u2019s foreign policy. It has not worked for America."}

If we could have intervened effectively in the Holocaust, who among us would say that we had a moral obligation not to go in? If we could\u2019ve stopped Rwanda, surely, if we had the ability, that would be something that we would have to strongly consider and act. So when genocide is happening, when ethnic cleansing is happening somewhere around the world and we stand idly by, that diminishes us. And so I do believe that we have to consider it as part of our interests, our national interests, in intervening where possible. But understand that there\u2019s a lot of cruelty around the world. We\u2019re not going to be able to be everywhere all the time. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for us to be able to work in concert with our allies. Let\u2019s take the example of Darfur just for a moment. Right now there\u2019s a peacekeeping force that has been set up and we have African Union troops in Darfur to stop a genocide that has killed hundreds of thousands of people. We could be providing logistical support, setting up a no-fly zone at relatively little cost to us, but we can only do it if we can help mobilize the international community and lead. And that\u2019s what I intend to do when I\u2019m president."}

S. SENATOR BARACK OBAMA (IL)DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE","Moderators":"TOM BROKAW","Speaker":"MCCAIN","Text":"Well, let me just follow up, my friends. If we had done what Senator Obama wanted done in Iraq, and that was set a date for withdrawal, which General Petraeus, our chief \u2014 chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff said would be a very dangerous course to take for America, then we would have had a wider war, we would have been back, Iranian influence would have increased, al Qaeda would have re- established a base. There was a lot at stake there, my friends. And I can tell you right now that Senator Obama would have brought our troops home in defeat. I\u2019ll bring them home with victory and with honor and that is a fundamental difference. The United States of America, Tom, is the greatest force for good, as I said. And we must do whatever we can to prevent genocide, whatever we can to prevent these terrible calamities that we have said never again. But it also has to be tempered with our ability to beneficially affect the situation. That requires a cool hand at the tiller. This requires a person who understands what our \u2014 the limits of our capability are. We went in to Somalia as a peacemaking organization, we ended up trying to be \u2014 excuse me, as a peacekeeping organization, we ended up trying to be peacemakers and we ended up having to withdraw in humiliation. In Lebanon, I stood up to President Reagan, my hero, and said, if we send Marines in there, how can we possibly beneficially affect this situation? And said we shouldn\u2019t. Unfortunately, almost 300 brave young Marines were killed. So you have to temper your decisions with the ability to beneficially affect the situation and realize you\u2019re sending America\u2019s most precious asset, American blood, into harm\u2019s way. And, again, I know those situations. I\u2019ve been in them all my life. And I can tell you right now the security of your young men and women who are serving in the military are my first priority right after our nation\u2019s security. And I may have to make those tough decisions. But I won\u2019t take them lightly. And I understand that we have to say never again to a Holocaust and never again to Rwanda. But we had also better be darn sure we don\u2019t leave and make the situation worse, thereby exacerbating our reputation and our ability to address crises in other parts of the world."}

S. SENATOR BARACK OBAMA (IL)DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE","Moderators":"TOM BROKAW","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"Katie, it\u2019s a terrific question and we have a difficult situation in Pakistan. I believe that part of the reason we have a difficult situation is because we made a bad judgment going into Iraq in the first place when we hadn\u2019t finished the job of hunting down bin Laden and crushing al Qaeda. So what happened was we got distracted, we diverted resources, and ultimately bin Laden escaped, set up base camps in the mountains of Pakistan in the northwest provinces there. They are now raiding our troops in Afghanistan, destabilizing the situation. They\u2019re stronger now than at any time since 2001. And that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s so important for us to reverse course, because that\u2019s the central front on terrorism. They are plotting to kill Americans right now. As Secretary Gates, the defense secretary, said, the war against terrorism began in that region and that\u2019s where it will end. So part of the reason I think it\u2019s so important for us to end the war in Iraq is to be able to get more troops into Afghanistan, put more pressure on the Afghan government to do what it needs to do, eliminate some of the drug trafficking that\u2019s funding terrorism. But I do believe that we have to change our policies with Pakistan. We can\u2019t coddle, as we did, a dictator, give him billions of dollars and then he\u2019s making peace treaties with the Taliban and militants. What I\u2019ve said is we\u2019re going to encourage democracy in Pakistan, expand our nonmilitary aid to Pakistan so that they have more of a stake in working with us, but insisting that they go after these militants. And if we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then I think that we have to act and we will take them out. We will kill bin Laden; we will crush Al Qaida. That has to be our biggest national security priority."}

Teddy Roosevelt used to say walk softly \u2014 talk softly, but carry a big stick. Senator Obama likes to talk loudly. In fact, he said he wants to announce that he\u2019s going to attack Pakistan. Remarkable. You know, if you are a country and you\u2019re trying to gain the support of another country, then you want to do everything you can that they would act in a cooperative fashion. When you announce that you\u2019re going to launch an attack into another country, it\u2019s pretty obvious that you have the effect that it had in Pakistan: It turns public opinion against us. Now, let me just go back with you very briefly. We drove the Russians out with \u2014 the Afghan freedom fighters drove the Russians out of Afghanistan, and then we made a most serious mistake. We washed our hands of Afghanistan. The Taliban came back in, Al Qaida, we then had the situation that required us to conduct the Afghan war. Now, our relations with Pakistan are critical, because the border areas are being used as safe havens by the Taliban and Al Qaida and other extremist organizations, and we have to get their support. Now, General Petraeus had a strategy, the same strategy \u2014 very, very different, because of the conditions and the situation \u2014 but the same fundamental strategy that succeeded in Iraq. And that is to get the support of the people. We need to help the Pakistani government go into Waziristan, where I visited, a very rough country, and \u2014 and get the support of the people, and get them to work with us and turn against the cruel Taliban and others. And by working and coordinating our efforts together, not threatening to attack them, but working with them, and where necessary use force, but talk softly, but carry a big stick."}

Now, long ago, I warned about Vladimir Putin. I said I looked into his eyes and saw three letters, a K, a G and a B. He has surrounded himself with former KGB apparatchiks. He has gradually repressed most of the liberties that we would expect for nations to observe, and he has exhibited most aggressive behavior, obviously, in Georgia. I said before, watch Ukraine. Ukraine, right now, is in the sights of Vladimir Putin, those that want to reassemble the old Soviet Union. We\u2019ve got to show moral support for Georgia. We\u2019ve got to show moral support for Ukraine. We\u2019ve got to advocate for their membership in NATO. We have to make the Russians understand that there are penalties for these this kind of behavior, this kind of naked aggression into Georgia, a tiny country and a tiny democracy. And so, of course we want to bring international pressures to bear on Russia in hopes that that will modify and eventually change their behavior. Now, the G-8 is one of those, but there are many others. But the Russians must understand that these kinds of actions and activities are not acceptable and hopefully we will use the leverage, economic, diplomatic and others united with our allies, with our allies and friends in Europe who are equally disturbed as we are about their recent behaviors."}

And for the most part I agree with Senator McCain on many of the steps that have to be taken. But we can\u2019t just provide moral support. We\u2019ve got to provide moral support to the Poles and Estonia and Latvia and all of the nations that were former Soviet satellites. But we\u2019ve also got to provide them with financial and concrete assistance to help rebuild their economies. Georgia in particular is now on the brink of enormous economic challenges. And some say that that\u2019s what Putin intended in the first place. The other thing we have to do, though, is we\u2019ve got to see around the corners. We\u2019ve got to anticipate some of these problems ahead of time. You know, back in April, I put out a statement saying that the situation in Georgia was unsustainable because you had Russian peacekeepers in these territories that were under dispute. And you knew that if the Russians themselves were trying to obtain some of these territories or push back against Georgia, that that was not a stable situation. So part of the job of the next commander-in-chief, in keeping all of you safe, is making sure that we can see some of the 21st Century challenges and anticipate them before they happen. We haven\u2019t been doing enough of that. We tend to be reactive. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing over the last eight years and that has actually made us more safe. That\u2019s part of what happened in Afghanistan, where we rushed into Iraq and Senator McCain and President Bush suggested that it wasn\u2019t that important to catch bin Laden right now and that we could muddle through, and that has cost us dearly. We\u2019ve got to be much more strategic if we\u2019re going to be able to deal with all of the challenges that we face out there. And one last point I want to make about Russia. Energy is going to be key in dealing with Russia. If we can reduce our energy consumption, that reduces the amount of petro dollars that they have to make mischief around the world. That will strengthen us and weaken them when it comes to issues like Georgia."}

I want to say, everything I ever learned about leadership I learned from a chief petty officer. And I thank you, and I thank you, my friend. Thanks for serving. Let \u2014 let \u2014 let me say that we obviously would not wait for the United Nations Security Council. I think the realities are that both Russia and China would probably pose significant obstacles. And our challenge right now is the Iranians continue on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons, and it\u2019s a great threat. It\u2019s not just a threat \u2014 threat to the state of Israel. It\u2019s a threat to the stability of the entire Middle East. If Iran acquires nuclear weapons, all the other countries will acquire them, too. The tensions will be ratcheted up. What would you do if you were the Israelis and the president of a country says that they are \u2014 they are determined to wipe you off the map, calls your country a stinking corpse? Now, Senator Obama without precondition wants to sit down and negotiate with them, without preconditions. That\u2019s what he stated, again, a matter of record. I want to make sure that the Iranians are put enough \u2014 that we put enough pressure on the Iranians by joining with our allies, imposing significant, tough sanctions to modify their behavior. And I think we can do that. I think, joining with our allies and friends in a league of democracies, that we can effectively abridge their behavior, and hopefully they would abandon this quest that they are on for nuclear weapons. But, at the end of the day, my friend, I have to tell you again, and you know what it\u2019s like to serve, and you know what it\u2019s like to sacrifice, but we can never allow a second Holocaust to take place."}

S. SENATOR BARACK OBAMA (IL)DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE","Moderators":"TOM BROKAW","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"Well, Terry, first of all, we honor your service, and we\u2019re grateful for it. We cannot allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon. It would be a game-changer in the region. Not only would it threaten Israel, our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world, but it would also create a possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists. And so it\u2019s unacceptable. And I will do everything that\u2019s required to prevent it. And we will never take military options off the table. And it is important that we don\u2019t provide veto power to the United Nations or anyone else in acting in our interests. It is important, though, for us to use all the tools at our disposal to prevent the scenario where we\u2019ve got to make those kinds of choices. And that\u2019s why I have consistently said that, if we can work more effectively with other countries diplomatically to tighten sanctions on Iran, if we can reduce our energy consumption through alternative energy, so that Iran has less money, if we can impose the kinds of sanctions that, say, for example, Iran right now imports gasoline, even though it\u2019s an oil-producer, because its oil infrastructure has broken down, if we can prevent them from importing the gasoline that they need and the refined petroleum products, that starts changing their cost-benefit analysis. That starts putting the squeeze on them. Now, it is true, though, that I believe that we should have direct talks \u2014 not just with our friends, but also with our enemies \u2014 to deliver a tough, direct message to Iran that, if you don\u2019t change your behavior, then there will be dire consequences. If you do change your behavior, then it is possible for you to re-join the community of nations. Now, it may not work. But one of the things we\u2019ve learned is, is that when we take that approach, whether it\u2019s in North Korea or in Iran, then we have a better chance at better outcomes. When President Bush decided we\u2019re not going to talk to Iran, we\u2019re not going to talk to North Korea, you know what happened? Iran went from zero centrifuges to develop nuclear weapons to 4,000. North Korea quadrupled its nuclear capability. We\u2019ve got to try to have talks, understanding that we\u2019re not taking military options off the table."}

And most of the time, I learn it by asking her. But, look, the nature of the challenges that we\u2019re going to face are immense and one of the things that we know about the presidency is that it\u2019s never the challenges that you expect. It\u2019s the challenges that you don\u2019t that end up consuming most of your time. But here\u2019s what I do know. I know that I wouldn\u2019t be standing here if it weren\u2019t for the fact that this country gave me opportunity. I came from very modest means. I had a single mom and my grandparents raised me and it was because of the help of scholarships and my grandmother scrimping on things that she might have wanted to purchase and my mom, at one point, getting food stamps in order for us to put food on the table. Despite all that, I was able to go to the best schools on earth and I was able to succeed in a way that I could not have succeeded anywhere else in this country. The same is true for Michelle and I\u2019m sure the same is true for a lot of you. And the question in this election is - are we going to pass on that same American dream to the next generation? Over the last eight years, we\u2019ve seen that dream diminish. Wages and incomes have gone down. People have lost their health care or are going bankrupt because they get sick. We\u2019ve got young people who have got the grades and the will and the drive to go to college, but they just don\u2019t have the money. And we can\u2019t expect that if we do the same things that we\u2019ve been doing over the last eight years, that somehow we are going to have a different outcome. We need fundamental change. That\u2019s what\u2019s at stake in this election. That\u2019s the reason I decided to run for president, and I\u2019m hopeful that all of you are prepared to continue this extraordinary journey that we call America. But we\u2019re going to have to have the courage and the sacrifice, the nerve to move in a new direction. Thank you."}

Americans are hurting tonight in a way they have not in our generation. There are challenges around the world that are new and different and there will be different \u2014 we will be talking about countries sometime in the future that we hardly know where they are on the map, some Americans.

And, by the way, our beloved Nancy Reagan is in the hospital tonight, so our thoughts and prayers are going with you. It\u2019s good to see you again, Senator Obama. Americans are hurting right now, and they\u2019re angry. They\u2019re hurting, and they\u2019re angry. They\u2019re innocent victims of greed and excess on Wall Street and as well as Washington, D.C. And they\u2019re angry, and they have every reason to be angry. And they want this country to go in a new direction. And there are elements of my proposal that you just outlined which I won\u2019t repeat. But we also have to have a short-term fix, in my view, and long- term fixes. Let me just talk to you about one of the short-term fixes. The catalyst for this housing crisis was the Fannie and Freddie Mae that caused subprime lending situation that now caused the housing market in America to collapse. I am convinced that, until we reverse this continued decline in home ownership and put a floor under it, and so that people have not only the hope and belief they can stay in their homes and realize the American dream, but that value will come up. Now, we have allocated $750 billion. Let\u2019s take 300 of that billion and go in and buy those home loan mortgages and negotiate with those people in their homes, 11 million homes or more, so that they can afford to pay the mortgage, stay in their home. Now, I know the criticism of this. Well, what about the citizen that stayed in their homes? That paid their mortgage payments? It doesn\u2019t help that person in their home if the next door neighbor\u2019s house is abandoned. And so we\u2019ve got to reverse this. We ought to put the homeowners first. And I am disappointed that Secretary Paulson and others have not made that their first priority."}

S. SENATOR BARACK OBAMA (IL)DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE","Moderators":"BOB SCHIEFFER","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"Well, first of all, I want to thank Hofstra University and the people of New York for hosting us tonight and it\u2019s wonderful to join Senator McCain again, and thank you, Bob. I think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And the financial rescue plan that Senator McCain and I supported is an important first step. And I pushed for some core principles - making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they\u2019re putting money up. Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process. And I think that it\u2019s going to take some time to work itself out. But what we haven\u2019t yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class. Because the fundamentals of the economy were weak even before this latest crisis. So I\u2019ve proposed four specific things that I think can help. Number one, let\u2019s focus on jobs. I want to end the tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and provide a tax credit for every company that\u2019s creating a job right here in America. Number two, let\u2019s help families right away by providing them a tax cut \u2014 a middle-class tax cut for people making less than $200,000, and let\u2019s allow them to access their IRA accounts without penalty if they\u2019re experiencing a crisis. Now Senator McCain and I agree with your idea that we\u2019ve got to help homeowners. That\u2019s why we included in the financial package a proposal to get homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate their mortgages. I disagree with Senator McCain in how to do it, because the way Senator McCain has designed his plan, it could be a giveaway to banks if we\u2019re buying full price for mortgages that now are worth a lot less. And we don\u2019t want to waste taxpayer money. And we\u2019ve got to get the financial package working much quicker than it has been working. Last point I want to make, though. We\u2019ve got some long-term challenges in this economy that have to be dealt with. We\u2019ve got to fix our energy policy that\u2019s giving our wealth away. We\u2019ve got to fix our health care system and we\u2019ve got to invest in our education system for every young person to be able to learn."}

Joe wants to buy the business that he has been in for all of these years, worked 10, 12 hours a day. And he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes. You were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people, which Joe was trying to realize the American dream. Now Senator Obama talks about the very, very rich. Joe, I want to tell you, I\u2019ll not only help you buy that business that you worked your whole life for and be able \u2014 and I\u2019ll keep your taxes low and I\u2019ll provide available and affordable health care for you and your employees. And I will not have \u2014 I will not stand for a tax increase on small business income. Fifty percent of small business income taxes are paid by small businesses. That\u2019s 16 million jobs in America.

Let me tell you what I\u2019m actually going to do. I think tax policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself. And we both want to cut taxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes for. Now, Senator McCain, the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in America. Exxon Mobil, and other oil companies, for example, would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks. What I\u2019ve said is I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of working Americans, 95 percent. If you make more \u2014 if you make less than a quarter million dollars a year, then you will not see your income tax go up, your capital gains tax go up, your payroll tax. Not one dime. And 95 percent of working families, 95 percent of you out there, will get a tax cut. In fact, independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than Senator McCain does. Now, the conversation I had with Joe the plumber, what I essentially said to him was, \u201cFive years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then.\u201d And what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who doesn\u2019t yet have money, I want to give them a tax break now. And that requires us to make some important choices. The last point I\u2019ll make about small businesses. Not only do 98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000, but I also want to give them additional tax breaks, because they are the drivers of the economy. They produce the most jobs."}

What I want to emphasize, though, is that I have been a strong proponent of pay-as- you-go. Every dollar that I\u2019ve proposed, I\u2019ve proposed an additional cut so that it matches. And some of the cuts, just to give you an example, we spend $15 billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies. It doesn\u2019t \u2014 under the Medicare plan \u2014 it doesn\u2019t help seniors get any better. It\u2019s not improving our health care system. It\u2019s just a giveaway. We need to eliminate a whole host of programs that don\u2019t work. And I want to go through the federal budget line by line, page by page, programs that don\u2019t work, we should cut. Programs that we need, we should make them work better. Now, what is true is that Senator McCain and I have a difference in terms of the need to invest in America and the American people. I mentioned health care earlier. If we make investments now so that people have coverage, that we are preventing diseases, that will save on Medicare and Medicaid in the future. If we invest in a serious energy policy, that will save in the amount of money we\u2019re borrowing from China to send to Saudi Arabia. If we invest now in our young people and their ability to go to college, that will allow them to drive this economy into the 21st century. But what is absolutely true is that, once we get through this economic crisis and some of the specific proposals to get us out of this slump, that we\u2019re not going to be able to go back to our profligate ways. And we\u2019re going to have to embrace a culture and an ethic of responsibility, all of us, corporations, the federal government, and individuals out there who may be living beyond their means."}

It sounds good. It\u2019s proposed periodically. It doesn\u2019t happen. And, in fact, an across-the-board spending freeze is a hatchet, and we do need a scalpel, because there are some programs that don\u2019t work at all. There are some programs that are underfunded. And I want to make sure that we are focused on those programs that work. Now, Senator McCain talks a lot about earmarks. That\u2019s one of the centerpieces of his campaign. Earmarks account for 0.5 percent of the total federal budget. There\u2019s no doubt that the system needs reform and there are a lot of screwy things that we end up spending money on, and they need to be eliminated. But it\u2019s not going to solve the problem. Now, the last thing I think we have to focus on is a little bit of history, just so that we understand what we\u2019re doing going forward. When President Bush came into office, we had a budget surplus and the national debt was a little over $5 trillion. It has doubled over the last eight years. And we are now looking at a deficit of well over half a trillion dollars. So one of the things that I think we have to recognize is pursuing the same kinds of policies that we pursued over the last eight years is not going to bring down the deficit. And, frankly, Senator McCain voted for four out of five of President Bush\u2019s budgets. We\u2019ve got to take this in a new direction, that\u2019s what I propose as president."}

Even FOX News disputes it, and that doesn\u2019t happen very often when it comes to accusations about me. So the fact of the matter is that if I occasionally have mistaken your policies for George Bush\u2019s policies, it\u2019s because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush. Now, you\u2019ve shown independence \u2014 commendable independence, on some key issues like torture, for example, and I give you enormous credit for that.

And I know from my experience in many campaigns that, if Senator Obama had asked \u2014 responded to my urgent request to sit down, and do town hall meetings, and come before the American people, we could have done at least 10 of them by now. When Senator Obama was first asked, he said, \u201cAny place, any time,\u201d the way Barry Goldwater and Jack Kennedy agreed to do, before the intervention of the tragedy at Dallas. So I think the tone of this campaign could have been very different. And the fact is, it\u2019s gotten pretty tough. And I regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns. But the fact is that it has taken many turns which I think are unacceptable. One of them happened just the other day, when a man I admire and respect \u2014 I\u2019ve written about him \u2014 Congressman John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, George Wallace. That, to me, was so hurtful. And, Senator Obama, you didn\u2019t repudiate those remarks. Every time there\u2019s been an out-of-bounds remark made by a Republican, no matter where they are, I have repudiated them. I hope that Senator Obama will repudiate those remarks that were made by Congressman John Lewis, very unfair and totally inappropriate. So I want to tell you, we will run a truthful campaign. This is a tough campaign. And it\u2019s a matter of fact that Senator Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history. And I can prove it. And, Senator Obama, when he said \u2014 and he signed a piece of paper that said he would take public financing for his campaign if I did \u2014 that was back when he was a long-shot candidate \u2014 you didn\u2019t keep your word. And when you looked into the camera in a debate with Senator Clinton and said, \u201cI will sit down and negotiate with John McCain about public financing before I make a decision,\u201d you didn\u2019t tell the American people the truth because you didn\u2019t. And that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s an unfortunate part. Now we have the highest spending by Senator Obama\u2019s campaign than any time since Watergate."}

That\u2019s the stuff that campaigns should be made of. The notion, though, that because we\u2019re not doing town hall meetings that justifies some of the ads that have been going up, not just from your own campaign directly, John, but 527s and other organizations that make some pretty tough accusations, well, I don\u2019t mind being attacked for the next three weeks. What the American people can\u2019t afford, though, is four more years of failed economic policies. And what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about what\u2019s most pressing to them: the economic crisis. Senator McCain\u2019s own campaign said publicly last week that, if we keep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to change the subject. And I would love to see the next three weeks devoted to talking about the economy, devoted to talking about health care, devoted to talking about energy, and figuring out how the American people can send their kids to college.

In fact, Mr. Ayers has become the centerpiece of Senator McCain\u2019s campaign over the last two or three weeks. This has been their primary focus. So let\u2019s get the record straight. Bill Ayers is a professor of education in Chicago. Forty years ago, when I was 8 years old, he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group. I have roundly condemned those acts. Ten years ago he served and I served on a school reform board that was funded by one of Ronald Reagan\u2019s former ambassadors and close friends, Mr. Annenberg. Other members on that board were the presidents of the University of Illinois, the president of Northwestern University, who happens to be a Republican, the president of The Chicago Tribune, a Republican- leaning newspaper. Mr. Ayers is not involved in my campaign. He has never been involved in this campaign. And he will not advise me in the White House. So that\u2019s Mr. Ayers. Now, with respect to ACORN, ACORN is a community organization. Apparently what they\u2019ve done is they were paying people to go out and register folks, and apparently some of the people who were out there didn\u2019t really register people, they just filled out a bunch of names. It had nothing to do with us. We were not involved. The only involvement I\u2019ve had with ACORN was I represented them alongside the U.S. Justice Department in making Illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at DMVs. Now, the reason I think that it\u2019s important to just get these facts out is because the allegation that Senator McCain has continually made is that somehow my associations are troubling. Let me tell you who I associate with. On economic policy, I associate with Warren Buffett and former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker. If I\u2019m interested in figuring out my foreign policy, I associate myself with my running mate, Joe Biden or with Dick Lugar, the Republican ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, or General Jim Jones, the former supreme allied commander of NATO. Those are the people, Democrats and Republicans, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House. And I think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, Senator McCain, says more about your campaign than it says about me."}

It\u2019s not just that he has some of the best foreign policy credentials of anybody. And Democrats and Republicans alike, I think, acknowledge his expertise there. But it\u2019s also that his entire life he has never forgotten where he came from, coming from Scranton, fighting on behalf of working families, remembering what it\u2019s like to see his father lose his job and go through a downward spiral economically. And, as a consequence, his consistent pattern throughout his career is to fight for the little guy. That\u2019s what he\u2019s done when it comes to economic policies that will help working families get a leg up. That\u2019s what he\u2019s done when it comes to, for example, passing the landmark 1994 crime bill, the Violence Against Women\u2019s Act. Joe has always made sure that he is fighting on behalf of working families, and I think he shares my core values and my sense of where the country needs to go. Because after eight years of failed policies, he and I both agree that what we\u2019re going to have to do is to reprioritize, make sure that we\u2019re investing in the American people, give tax cuts not to the wealthiest corporations, but give them to small businesses and give them to individuals who are struggling right now, make sure that we finally get serious about energy independence, something that has been languishing in Washington for 30 years, and make sure that our kids get a great education and can afford to go to college. So, on the key issues that are of importance to American families, Joe Biden\u2019s always been on the right side, and I think he will make an outstanding president if, heaven forbid, something happened to me."}

We can store and reprocess spent nuclear fuel, Senator Obama, no problem. So the point is with nuclear power, with wind, tide, solar, natural gas, with development of flex fuel, hybrid, clean coal technology, clean coal technology is key in the heartland of America that\u2019s hurting rather badly.

S. SENATOR BARACK OBAMA (IL)DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE","Moderators":"BOB SCHIEFFER","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"I think that in ten years, we can reduce our dependence so that we no longer have to import oil from the Middle East or Venezuela. I think that\u2019s about a realistic timeframe. And this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face. Obviously, we\u2019ve got an immediate crisis right now. But nothing is more important than us no longer borrowing $700 billion or more from China and sending it to Saudi Arabia. It\u2019s mortgaging our children\u2019s future. Now, from the start of this campaign, I\u2019ve identified this as one of my top priorities and here is what I think we have to do. Number one, we do need to expand domestic production and that means, for example, telling the oil companies the 68 million acres that they currently have leased that they\u2019re not drilling, use them or lose them. And I think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil. But understand, we only have three to four percent of the world\u2019s oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world\u2019s oil, which means that we can\u2019t drill our way out of the problem. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve focused on putting resources into solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal. These have been priorities of mine since I got to the Senate, and it is absolutely critical that we develop a high fuel efficient car that\u2019s built not in Japan and not in South Korea, but built here in the United States of America. We invented the auto industry and the fact that we have fallen so far behind is something that we have to work on. Now I just want to make one last point because Senator McCain mentioned NAFTA and the issue of trade and that actually bears on this issue. I believe in free trade. But I also believe that for far too long, certainly during the course of the Bush administration with the support of Senator McCain, the attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement. And NAFTA doesn\u2019t have \u2014 did not have enforceable labor agreements and environmental agreements. And what I said was we should include those and make them enforceable. In the same way that we should enforce rules against China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper. And when it comes to South Korea, we\u2019ve got a trade agreement up right now, they are sending hundreds of thousands of South Korean cars into the United States. That\u2019s all good. We can only get 4,000 to 5,000 into South Korea. That is not free trade. We\u2019ve got to have a president who is going to be advocating on behalf of American businesses and American workers and I make no apology for that."}

And you really have to pay attention to words. He said, we will look at offshore drilling. Did you get that? Look at. We can offshore drill now. We\u2019ve got to do it now. We will reduce the cost of a barrel of oil because we show the world that we have a supply of our own. It\u2019s doable. The technology is there and we have to drill now. Now, on the subject of free trade agreements. I am a free trader. And I need \u2014 we need to have education and training programs for displaced workers that work, going to our community colleges. But let me give you another example of a free trade agreement that Senator Obama opposes. Right now, because of previous agreements, some made by President Clinton, the goods and products that we send to Colombia, which is our largest agricultural importer of our products, is \u2014 there\u2019s a billion dollars that we \u2014 our businesses have paid so far in order to get our goods in there. Because of previous agreements, their goods and products come into our country for free. So Senator Obama, who has never traveled south of our border, opposes the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. The same country that\u2019s helping us try to stop the flow of drugs into our country that\u2019s killing young Americans. And also the country that just freed three Americans that will help us create jobs in America because they will be a market for our goods and products without having to pay \u2014 without us having to pay the billions of dollars \u2014 the billion dollars and more that we\u2019ve already paid. Free trade with Colombia is something that\u2019s a no-brainer. But maybe you ought to travel down there and visit them and maybe you could understand it a lot better."}

S. SENATOR BARACK OBAMA (IL)DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE","Moderators":"BOB SCHIEFFER","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"Let me respond. Actually, I understand it pretty well. The history in Colombia right now is that labor leaders have been targeted for assassination on a fairly consistent basis and there have not been prosecutions. And what I have said, because the free trade \u2014 the trade agreement itself does have labor and environmental protections, but we have to stand for human rights and we have to make sure that violence isn\u2019t being perpetrated against workers who are just trying to organize for their rights, which is why, for example, I supported the Peruvian Free Trade Agreement which was a well-structured agreement. But I think that the important point is we\u2019ve got to have a president who understands the benefits of free trade but also is going to enforce unfair trade agreements and is going to stand up to other countries. And the last point I\u2019ll make, because we started on energy. When I talked about the automakers, they are obviously getting hammered right now. They were already having a tough time because of high gas prices. And now with the financial crisis, car dealerships are closing and people can\u2019t get car loans. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s important for us to get loan guarantees to the automakers, but we do have to hold them responsible as well to start producing the highly fuel-efficient cars of the future. And Detroit had dragged its feet too long in terms of getting that done. It\u2019s going to be one of my highest priorities because transportation accounts for about 30 percent of our total energy consumption. If we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs all across America, including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century."}

Free trade between ourselves and Colombia, I just recited to you the benefits of concluding that agreement, a billion dollars of American dollars that could have gone to creating jobs and businesses in the United States, opening up those markets.

And the last president of the United States that tried that was Herbert Hoover, and we went from a deep recession into a depression.

S. SENATOR BARACK OBAMA (IL)DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE","Moderators":"BOB SCHIEFFER","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"We\u2019ve got to do both, and that\u2019s exactly what my plan does. Look, as I travel around the country, this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again. Just yesterday, I was in Toledo shaking some hands in a line. Two women, both of them probably in their mid- to late-50s, had just been laid off of their plant. Neither of them have health insurance. And they were desperate for some way of getting coverage, because, understandably, they\u2019re worried that, if they get sick, they could go bankrupt. So here\u2019s what my plan does. If you have health insurance, then you don\u2019t have to do anything. If you\u2019ve got health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan. The only thing we\u2019re going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you. And we estimate we can cut the average family\u2019s premium by about $2,500 per year. If you don\u2019t have health insurance, then what we\u2019re going to do is to provide you the option of buying into the same kind of federal pool that both Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees, which will give you high-quality care, choice of doctors, at lower costs, because so many people are part of this insured group. We\u2019re going to make sure that insurance companies can\u2019t discriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions. We\u2019ll negotiate with the drug companies for the cheapest available price on drugs. We are going to invest in information technology to eliminate bureaucracy and make the system more efficient. And we are going to make sure that we manage chronic illnesses, like diabetes and heart disease, that cost a huge amount, but could be prevented. We\u2019ve got to put more money into preventive care. This will cost some money on the front end, but over the long term this is the only way that not only are we going to make families healthy, but it\u2019s also how we\u2019re going to save the federal budget, because we can\u2019t afford these escalating costs."}

They\u2019re seeing their premiums, their co-pays go up. Forty-seven million Americans are without health insurance in America today. And it really is the cost, the escalating costs of health care that are inflicting such pain on working families and people across this country. And I am convinced we need to do a lot of things. We need to put health care records online. The V.A. does that. That will \u2014 that will reduce costs. We need to have more community health centers. We need to have walk-in clinics. The rise of obesity amongst young Americans is one of the most alarming statistics that there is. We should have physical fitness programs and nutrition programs in schools. Every parent should know what\u2019s going on there. We \u2014 we need to have \u2014 we need to have employers reward employees who join health clubs and practice wellness and fitness. But I want to give every American family a $5,000 refundable tax credit. Take it and get anywhere in America the health care that you wish. Now, my old buddy, Joe, Joe the plumber, is out there. Now, Joe, Senator Obama\u2019s plan, if you\u2019re a small business and you are able \u2014 and your \u2014 the guy that sells to you will not have his capital gains tax increase, which Senator Obama wants, if you\u2019re out there, my friend, and you\u2019ve got employees, and you\u2019ve got kids, if you don\u2019t get \u2014 adopt the health care plan that Senator Obama mandates, he\u2019s going to fine you. Now, Senator Obama, I\u2019d like \u2014 still like to know what that fine is going to be, and I don\u2019t think that Joe right now wants to pay a fine when he is seeing such difficult times in America\u2019s economy. Senator Obama wants to set up health care bureaucracies, take over the health care of America through \u2014 as he said, his object is a single payer system.

S. SENATOR BARACK OBAMA (IL)DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE","Moderators":"BOB SCHIEFFER","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"Zero, because as I said in our last debate and I\u2019ll repeat, John, I exempt small businesses from the requirement for large businesses that can afford to provide health care to their employees, but are not doing it. I exempt small businesses from having to pay into a kitty. But large businesses that can afford it, we\u2019ve got a choice. Either they provide health insurance to their employees or somebody has to. Right now, what happens is those employees get dumped into either the Medicaid system, which taxpayers pick up, or they\u2019re going to the emergency room for uncompensated care, which everybody picks up in their premiums. The average family is paying an additional $900 a year in higher premiums because of the uninsured. So here\u2019s what we do. We exempt small businesses. In fact, what, Joe, if you want to do the right thing with your employees and you want to provide them health insurance, we\u2019ll give you a 50 percent credit so that you will actually be able to afford it. If you don\u2019t have health insurance or you want to buy into a group plan, you will be able to buy into the plan that I just described. Now, what we haven\u2019t talked about is Senator McCain\u2019s plan. He says he\u2019s going to give you all a $5,000 tax credit. That sounds pretty good. And you can go out and buy your own insurance. Here\u2019s the problem \u2014 that for about 20 million people, you may find yourselves no longer having employer-based health insurance. This is because younger people might be able to get health insurance for $5,000, young and healthy folks. Older folks, less healthy folks, what\u2019s going to end up happening is that you\u2019re going to be the only ones left in your employer-based system, your employers won\u2019t be able to afford it. And once you\u2019re out on your own with this $5,000 credit, Senator McCain, for the first time, is going to be taxing the health care benefits that you have from your employer. And this is your plan, John. For the first time in history, you will be taxing people\u2019s health care benefits. By the way, the average policy costs about $12,000. So if you\u2019ve got $5,000 and it\u2019s going to cost you $12,000, that\u2019s a loss for you. Last point about Senator McCain\u2019s plan is that insurers right now, the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and, under Senator McCain\u2019s plan, those rules would be stripped away and you would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherry-picking and excluding people from coverage. That, I think, is a mistake and I think that this is a fundamental difference in our campaign and how we would approach health care."}

That\u2019s big government at its best. Now, 95 percent of the people in America will receive more money under my plan because they will receive not only their present benefits, which may be taxed, which will be taxed, but then you add $5,000 onto it, except for those people who have the gold-plated Cadillac insurance policies that have to do with cosmetic surgery and transplants and all of those kinds of things.

If you notice that in all of this proposal, Senator \u2014 government wants \u2014 Senator Obama wants government to do the job. Senator Obama wants government to do the job. I want, Joe, you to do the job. I want to leave money in your pocket. I want you to be able to choose the health care for you and your family. That\u2019s what I\u2019m all about. And we\u2019ve got too much government and too much spending and the government is \u2014 the size of government has grown by 40 percent in the last eight years. We can\u2019t afford that in the next eight years and Senator Obama, with the Democrats in charge of Congress, things have gotten worse. Have you noticed, they\u2019ve been in charge the last two years."}

And it is true that this is going to be, I think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president. It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance. Now I would not provide a litmus test. But I am somebody who believes that Roe versus Wade was rightly decided. I think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that I think good people on both sides can disagree on. But what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision. And I think that the Constitution has a right to privacy in it that shouldn\u2019t be subject to state referendum, any more than our First Amendment rights are subject to state referendum, any more than many of the other rights that we have should be subject to popular vote. So this is going to be an important issue. I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through. I\u2019ll just give you one quick example. Senator McCain and I disagreed recently when the Supreme Court made it more difficult for a woman named Lilly Ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination. For years, she had been getting paid less than a man had been paid for doing the exact same job. And when she brought a suit, saying equal pay for equal work, the judges said, well, you know, it\u2019s taken you too long to bring this lawsuit, even though she didn\u2019t know about it until fairly recently. We tried to overturn it in the Senate. I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it. I think that it\u2019s important for judges to understand that if a woman is out there trying to raise a family, trying to support her family, and is being treated unfairly, then the court has to stand up, if nobody else will. And that\u2019s the kind of judge that I want."}

It was a trial lawyer\u2019s dream. Let me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue. We have to change the culture of America. Those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that. And it\u2019s got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman who\u2019s facing this terribly difficult decision. Senator Obama, as a member of the Illinois State Senate, voted in the Judiciary Committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion. He voted against that. And then, on the floor of the State Senate, as he did 130 times as a state senator, he voted present. Then there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really \u2014 one of the bad procedures, a terrible. And then, on the floor of the Illinois State Senate, he voted present. I don\u2019t know how you vote \u201cpresent\u201d on some of that. I don\u2019t know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America. And that\u2019s his record, and that\u2019s a matter of his record. And he\u2019ll say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the Illinois State Senate. It was clear-cut votes that Senator Obama voted, I think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream America."}

S. SENATOR BARACK OBAMA (IL)DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE","Moderators":"BOB SCHIEFFER","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"Yes, let me respond to this. If it sounds incredible that I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant, that\u2019s because it\u2019s not true. The \u2014 here are the facts. There was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade. The fact is that there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it. And the Illinois Medical Society, the organization of doctors in Illinois, voted against it. Their Hippocratic Oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books. With respect to partial-birth abortion, I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there\u2019s an exception for the mother\u2019s health and life, and this did not contain that exception. And I attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional. And that was rejected, and that\u2019s why I voted present, because I\u2019m willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception. The last point I want to make on the issue of abortion. This is an issue that \u2014 look, it divides us. And in some ways, it may be difficult to \u2014 to reconcile the two views. But there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, \u201cWe should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby.\u201d Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for the first time this year, and I think that\u2019s where we can find some common ground, because nobody\u2019s pro-abortion. I think it\u2019s always a tragic situation. We should try to reduce these circumstances."}

So we\u2019ve got to get our education system right. Now, typically, what\u2019s happened is that there\u2019s been a debate between more money or reform, and I think we need both. In some cases, we are going to have to invest. Early childhood education, which closes the achievement gap, so that every child is prepared for school, every dollar we invest in that, we end up getting huge benefits with improved reading scores, reduced dropout rates, reduced delinquency rates. I think it\u2019s going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in math and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability. And I think it\u2019s important for us to make college affordable. Right now, I meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if they\u2019re going to college, they are taking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt, and it\u2019s very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that they\u2019re going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve proposed a $4,000 tuition credit, every student, every year, in exchange for some form of community service, whether it\u2019s military service, whether it\u2019s Peace Corps, whether it\u2019s working in a community. If we do those things, then I believe that we can create a better school system. But there\u2019s one last ingredient that I just want to mention, and that\u2019s parents. We can\u2019t do it just in the schools. Parents are going to have to show more responsibility. They\u2019ve got to turn off the TV set, put away the video games, and, finally, start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need."}

There\u2019s no doubt that we have achieved equal access to schools in America after a long and difficult and terrible struggle. But what is the advantage in a low income area of sending a child to a failed school and that being your only choice? So choice and competition amongst schools is one of the key elements that\u2019s already been proven in places in like New Orleans and New York City and other places, where we have charter schools, where we take good teachers and we reward them and promote them. And we find bad teachers another line of work. And we have to be able to give parents the same choice, frankly, that Senator Obama and Mrs. Obama had and Cindy and I had to send our kids to the school \u2014 their kids to the school of their choice. Charter schools aren\u2019t the only answer, but they\u2019re providing competition. They are providing the kind of competitions that have upgraded both schools \u2014 types of schools. Now, throwing money at the problem is not the answer. You will find that some of the worst school systems in America get the most money per student. So I believe that we need to reward these good teachers. We need to encourage programs such as Teach for America and Troops to Teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which \u2014 or have the certification that some are required in some states. Look, we must improve education in this country. As far as college education is concerned, we need to make those student loans available. We need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet. We need to have full student loan program for in-state tuition. And we certainly need to adjust the certain loan eligibility to inflation."}

S. SENATOR BARACK OBAMA (IL)DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE","Moderators":"BOB SCHIEFFER","Speaker":"OBAMA","Text":"Well, we have a tradition of local control of the schools and that\u2019s a tradition that has served us well. But I do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do. Now we tried to do this under President Bush. He put forward No Child Left Behind. Unfortunately, they left the money behind for No Child Left Behind. And local school districts end up having more of a burden, a bunch of unfunded mandates, the same kind of thing that happened with special education where we did the right thing by saying every school should provide education to kids with special needs, but we never followed through on the promise of funding, and that left local school districts very cash-strapped. So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support. Senator McCain and I actually agree on two things that he just mentioned. Charter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions. I think it\u2019s important to foster competition inside the public schools. And we also agree on the need for making sure that if we have bad teachers that they are swiftly \u2014 after given an opportunity to prove themselves, if they can\u2019t hack it, then we need to move on because our kids have to have their best future. Where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers \u2014 give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system. And I also have to disagree on Senator McCain\u2019s record when it comes to college accessibility and affordability. Recently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didn\u2019t seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was, well, you know, we can\u2019t give money to every interest group that comes along. I don\u2019t think America\u2019s youth are interest groups, I think they\u2019re our future. And this is an example of where we are going to have to prioritize. We can\u2019t say we\u2019re going to do things and then not explain in concrete terms how we\u2019re going to pay for it. And if we\u2019re going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it. It\u2019s not going to happen on its own."}

I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware, Senator Obama, of the program in the Washington, D.C., school system where vouchers are provided and there\u2019s a certain number, I think it\u2019s a thousand and some and some 9,000 parents asked to be eligible for that. Because they wanted to have the same choice that you and I and Cindy and your wife have had. And that is because they wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children. And we all know the state of the Washington, D.C., school system. That was vouchers. That was vouchers, Senator Obama. And I\u2019m frankly surprised you didn\u2019t pay more attention to that example. Now as far as the No Child Left Behind is concerned, it was a great first beginning in my view. It had its flaws, it had its problems, the first time we had looked at the issue of education in America from a nationwide perspective. And we need to fix a lot of the problems. We need to sit down and reauthorize it. But, again, spending more money isn\u2019t always the answer. I think the Head Start program is a great program. A lot of people, including me, said, look, it\u2019s not doing what it should do. By the third grade many times children who were in the Head Start program aren\u2019t any better off than the others. Let\u2019s reform it. Let\u2019s reform it and fund it. That was, of course, out-of-bounds by the Democrats. We need to reform these programs. We need to have transparency. We need to have rewards. It\u2019s a system that cries out for accountability and transparency and the adequate funding. And I just said to you earlier, town hall meeting after town hall meeting, parents come with kids, children \u2014 precious children who have autism. Sarah Palin knows about that better than most. And we\u2019ll find and we\u2019ll spend the money, research, to find the cause of autism. And we\u2019ll care for these young children. And all Americans will open their wallets and their hearts to do so. But to have a situation, as you mentioned in our earlier comments, that the most expensive education in the world is in the United States of America also means that it cries out for reform, as well. And I will support those reforms, and I will fund the ones that are reformed. But I\u2019m not going to continue to throw money at a problem. And I\u2019ve got to tell you that vouchers, where they are requested and where they are agreed to, are a good and workable system. And it\u2019s been proven."}

Thank you, Arizona State, for welcoming us. And thank you to the Presidential Commission for undertaking this enormous task. We\u2019re proud to be here. Mr. President, I\u2019m glad to be here with you again to share similarities and differences with the American people. Will we ever be safe and secure again? Yes. We absolutely must be. That\u2019s the goal. Now, how do we achieve it is the most critical component of it. I believe that this president, regrettably, rushed us into a war, made decisions about foreign policy, pushed alliances away. And, as a result, America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be. The measurement is not - Are we safer? The measurement is - Are we as safe as we ought to be? And there are a host of options that this president had available to him, like making sure that at all our ports in America containers are inspected. Only 95 percent of them \u2014 95 percent come in today uninspected. That\u2019s not good enough. People who fly on airplanes today, the cargo hold is not X-rayed, but the baggage is. That\u2019s not good enough. Firehouses don\u2019t have enough firefighters in them. Police officers are being cut from the streets of America because the president decided to cut the COPS program. So we can do a better job of homeland security. I can do a better job of waging a smarter, more effective war on terror and guarantee that we will go after the terrorists. I will hunt them down, and we\u2019ll kill them, we\u2019ll capture them. We\u2019ll do whatever is necessary to be safe. But I pledge this to you, America - I will do it in the way that Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy and others did, where we build the strongest alliances, where the world joins together, where we have the best intelligence and where we are able, ultimately, to be more safe and secure."}

Yes, we can be safe and secure, if we stay on the offense against the terrorists and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world. I have got a comprehensive strategy to not only chase down the Al Qaida, wherever it exists \u2014 and we\u2019re making progress; three-quarters of Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice \u2014 but to make sure that countries that harbor terrorists are held to account. As a result of securing ourselves and ridding the Taliban out of Afghanistan, the Afghan people had elections this weekend. And the first voter was a 19-year-old woman. Think about that. Freedom is on the march. We held to account a terrorist regime in Saddam Hussein. In other words, in order to make sure we\u2019re secure, there must be a comprehensive plan. My opponent just this weekend talked about how terrorism could be reduced to a nuisance, comparing it to prostitution, illegal gambling. I think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous. I don\u2019t think you can secure America for the long run if you don\u2019t have a comprehensive view as to how to defeat these people. At home, we\u2019ll do everything we can to protect the homeland. I signed the homeland security bill to better align our assets and resources. My opponent voted against it. We\u2019re doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports. But absolutely we can be secure in the long run. It just takes good, strong leadership."}

My call to our fellow Americans is if you\u2019re healthy, if you\u2019re younger, don\u2019t get a flu shot this year. Help us prioritize those who need to get the flu shot, the elderly and the young. The CDC, responsible for health in the United States, is setting those priorities and is allocating the flu vaccine accordingly. I haven\u2019t gotten a flu shot, and I don\u2019t intend to because I want to make sure those who are most vulnerable get treated. We have a problem with litigation in the United States of America. Vaccine manufacturers are worried about getting sued, and therefore they have backed off from providing this kind of vaccine. One of the reasons I\u2019m such a strong believer in legal reform is so that people aren\u2019t afraid of producing a product that is necessary for the health of our citizens and then end up getting sued in a court of law.

It\u2019s not working for the American family. And it\u2019s gotten worse under President Bush over the course of the last years. Five million Americans have lost their health insurance in this country. You\u2019ve got about a million right here in Arizona, just shy, 950,000, who have no health insurance at all. 82,000 Arizonians lost their health insurance under President Bush\u2019s watch. 223,000 kids in Arizona have no health insurance at all. All across our country \u2014 go to Ohio, 1. 4 million Ohioans have no health insurance, 114,000 of them lost it under President Bush; Wisconsin, 82,000 Wisconsinites lost it under President Bush. This president has turned his back on the wellness of America. And there is no system. In fact, it\u2019s starting to fall apart not because of lawsuits \u2014 though they are a problem, and John Edwards and I are committed to fixing them \u2014 but because of the larger issue that we don\u2019t cover Americans. Children across our country don\u2019t have health care. We\u2019re the richest country on the face of the planet, the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it.

During the 1990s, we had pay-as-you-go rules. If you were going to pass something in the Congress, you had to show where you are going to pay for it and how. President Bush has taken \u2014 he\u2019s the only president in history to do this. He\u2019s also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs \u2014 1. 6 million jobs lost. He\u2019s the only president to have incomes of families go down for the last three years; the only president to see exports go down; the only president to see the lowest level of business investment in our country as it is today. Now, I\u2019m going to reverse that. I\u2019m going to change that. We\u2019re going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s. Every plan that I have laid out \u2014 my health-care plan, my plan for education, my plan for kids to be able to get better college loans \u2014 I\u2019ve shown exactly how I\u2019m going to pay for those. And we start \u2014 we don\u2019t do it exclusively \u2014 but we start by rolling back George Bush\u2019s unaffordable tax cut for the wealthiest people, people earning more than $200,000 a year, and we pass, hopefully, the McCain-Kerry Commission which identified some $60 billion that we can get. We shut the loophole which has American workers actually subsidizing the loss of their own job. They just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days - $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from China. I\u2019m going to stand up and fight for the American worker. And I am going to do it in a way that\u2019s fiscally sound. I show how I pay for the health care, how we pay for the education. I have a manufacturing jobs credit. We pay for it by shutting that loophole overseas. We raise the student loans. I pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks. This president has never once vetoed one bill; the first president in a hundred years not to do that."}

He talks about PAYGO. I\u2019ll tell you what PAYGO means, when you\u2019re a senator from Massachusetts, when you\u2019re a colleague of Ted Kennedy, pay go means: You pay, and he goes ahead and spends. He\u2019s proposed $2. 2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so-called tax on the rich, which is also a tax on many small-business owners in America, raises $600 million by our account \u2014 billion, $800 billion by his account. There is a tax gap. And guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap? The middle class. I propose a detailed budget, Bob. I sent up my budget man to the Congress, and he says, here\u2019s how we\u2019re going to reduce the deficit in half by five years. It requires pro-growth policies that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the halls of Congress."}

We want to help pay for you to gain the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century. You know, there\u2019s a lot of talk about how to keep the economy growing. We talk about fiscal matters. But perhaps the best way to keep jobs here in America and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works. I went to Washington to solve problems. And I saw a problem in the public education system in America. They were just shuffling too many kids through the system, year after year, grade after grade, without learning the basics. And so we said - Let\u2019s raise the standards. We\u2019re spending more money, but let\u2019s raise the standards and measure early and solve problems now, before it\u2019s too late. No, education is how to help the person who\u2019s lost a job. Education is how to make sure we\u2019ve got a workforce that\u2019s productive and competitive. Got four more years, I\u2019ve got more to do to continue to raise standards, to continue to reward teachers and school districts that are working, to emphasize math and science in the classrooms, to continue to expand Pell Grants to make sure that people have an opportunity to start their career with a college diploma. And so the person you talked to, I say, here\u2019s some help, here\u2019s some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go a community college in your neighborhood, a community college which is providing the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.

Let me come back in one moment to that, but I want to speak for a second, if I can, to what the president said about fiscal responsibility. Being lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country. This president has taken a $5. 6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see. Health-care costs for the average American have gone up 64 percent; tuitions have gone up 35 percent; gasoline prices up 30 percent; Medicare premiums went up 17 percent a few days ago; prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year. But guess what, America? The wages of Americans have gone down. The jobs that are being created in Arizona right now are paying about $13,700 less than the jobs that we\u2019re losing. And the president just walks on by this problem. The fact is that he\u2019s cut job-training money. $1 billion was cut. They only added a little bit back this year because it\u2019s an election year. They\u2019ve cut the Pell Grants and the Perkins loans to help kids be able to go to college. They\u2019ve cut the training money. They\u2019ve wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed. I\u2019m going to do those things, because that\u2019s what\u2019s right in America: Help workers to transition in every respect."}

I blame the president for the things the president could do that has an impact on it. Outsourcing is going to happen. I\u2019ve acknowledged that in union halls across the country. I\u2019ve had shop stewards stand up and say, \u201cWill you promise me you\u2019re going to stop all this outsourcing? \u201cAnd I\u2019ve looked them in the eye and I\u2019ve said, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t do that. \u201c What I can promise you is that I will make the playing field as fair as possible, that I will, for instance, make certain that with respect to the tax system that you as a worker in America are not subsidizing the loss of your job. Today, if you\u2019re an American business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas. You get to defer your taxes. So if you\u2019re looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, \u201cHey, I do better overseas than I do here in America. \u201c That\u2019s not smart. I don\u2019t want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job. And when I\u2019m president, we\u2019re going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and we\u2019re going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations, 5 percent. And we\u2019re going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here. The second thing that we can do is provide a fair trade playing field. This president didn\u2019t stand up for Boeing when Airbus was violating international rules and subsidies. He discovered Boeing during the course of this campaign after I\u2019d been talking about it for months. The fact is that the president had an opportunity to stand up and take on China for currency manipulation. There are companies that wanted to petition the administration. They were told - Don\u2019t even bother; we\u2019re not going to listen to it. The fact is that there have been markets shut to us that we haven\u2019t stood up and fought for. I\u2019m going to fight for a fair trade playing field for the American worker. And I will fight for the American worker just as hard as I fight for my own job. That\u2019s what the American worker wants. And if we do that, we can have an impact. Plus, we need fiscal discipline. Restore fiscal discipline, we\u2019ll do a lot better."}

But as we respect someone\u2019s rights, and as we profess tolerance, we shouldn\u2019t change \u2014 or have to change \u2014 our basic views on the sanctity of marriage. I believe in the sanctity of marriage. I think it\u2019s very important that we protect marriage as an institution, between a man and a woman. I proposed a constitutional amendment. The reason I did so was because I was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage, and the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution. It has also the benefit of allowing citizens to participate in the process. After all, when you amend the Constitution, state legislatures must participate in the ratification of the Constitution. I\u2019m deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the United States. You know, Congress passed a law called DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act. My opponent was against it. It basically protected states from the action of one state to another. It also defined marriage as between a man and woman. But I\u2019m concerned that that will get overturned. And if it gets overturned, then we\u2019ll end up with marriage being defined by courts, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s in our nation\u2019s interests."}

But I also believe that because we are the United States of America, we\u2019re a country with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with rights that we afford people, that you can\u2019t discriminate in the workplace. You can\u2019t discriminate in the rights that you afford people. You can\u2019t disallow someone the right to visit their partner in a hospital.

What is an article of faith for me is not something that I can legislate on somebody who doesn\u2019t share that article of faith. I believe that choice is a woman\u2019s choice. It\u2019s between a woman, God and her doctor. And that\u2019s why I support that. Now, I will not allow somebody to come in and change Roe v. Wade. The president has never said whether or not he would do that. But we know from the people he\u2019s tried to appoint to the court he wants to. I will not. I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade. Now, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic. I was an altar boy. I know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me. And as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not running to be a Catholic president. I\u2019m running to be a president who happens to be Catholic. \u201c My faith affects everything that I do, in truth. There\u2019s a great passage of the Bible that says, \u201cWhat does it mean, my brother, to say you have faith if there are no deeds? Faith without works is dead. \u201c And I think that everything you do in public life has to be guided by your faith, affected by your faith, but without transferring it in any official way to other people. That\u2019s why I fight against poverty. That\u2019s why I fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth. That\u2019s why I fight for equality and justice. All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith. But I know this, that President Kennedy in his inaugural address told all of us that here on Earth, God\u2019s work must truly be our own. And that\u2019s what we have to \u2014 I think that\u2019s the test of public service."}

I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters. I believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life. I understand there\u2019s great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions. Take, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion. It\u2019s a brutal practice. People from both political parties came together in the halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice. It made a lot of sense. My opponent, in that he\u2019s out of the mainstream, voted against that law. What I\u2019m saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws \u2014 it\u2019s a great alternative to abortion \u2014 continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs. The last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs. That\u2019s great. I appreciate that very much. All of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable alternative to abortion."}

There\u2019s a \u2014 no, look, there\u2019s a systemic problem. Health-care costs are on the rise because the consumers are not involved in the decision-making process. Most health-care costs are covered by third parties. And therefore, the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care. And there\u2019s no market forces involved with health care. It\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts. These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax-free savings. Businesses can contribute, employees can contribute on a contractual basis. But this is a way to make sure people are actually involved with the decision-making process on health care. Secondly, I do believe the lawsuits \u2014 I don\u2019t believe, I know \u2014 that the lawsuits are causing health-care costs to rise in America. That\u2019s why I\u2019m such a strong believer in medical liability reform. In the last debate, my opponent said those lawsuits only caused the cost to go up by 1 percent. Well, he didn\u2019t include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the federal government some $28 billion a year and costs our society between $60 billion and $100 billion a year. Thirdly, one of the reasons why there\u2019s still high cost in medicine is because this is \u2014 they don\u2019t use any information technology. It\u2019s like if you looked at the \u2014 it\u2019s the equivalent of the buggy and horse days, compared to other industries here in America. And so, we\u2019ve got to introduce high technology into health care. We\u2019re beginning to do it. We\u2019re changing the language. We want there to be electronic medical records to cut down on error, as well as reduce cost. People tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, it\u2019ll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system. And finally, moving generic drugs to the market quicker. And so, those are four ways to help control the costs in health care."}

Let me give you a prime example. In the Senate we passed the right of Americans to import drugs from Canada. But the president and his friends took it out in the House, and now you don\u2019t have that right. The president blocked you from the right to have less expensive drugs from Canada. We also wanted Medicare to be able to negotiate bulk purchasing. The VA does that. The VA provides lower-cost drugs to our veterans. We could have done that in Medicare. Medicare is paid for by the American taxpayer. Medicare belongs to you. Medicare is for seniors, who many of them are on fixed income, to lift them out of poverty. But rather than help you, the taxpayer, have lower cost, rather than help seniors have less expensive drugs, the president made it illegal \u2014 illegal \u2014 for Medicare to actually go out and bargain for lower prices. Result - $139 billion windfall profit to the drug companies coming out of your pockets. That\u2019s a large part of your 17 percent increase in Medicare premiums. When I\u2019m president, I\u2019m sending that back to Congress and we\u2019re going to get a real prescription drug benefit. Now, we also have people sicker because they don\u2019t have health insurance. So whether it\u2019s diabetes or cancer, they come to hospitals later and it costs America more. We got to have health care for all Americans."}

One called it fiction. The other called it untrue. The fact is that my health-care plan, America, is very simple. It gives you the choice. I don\u2019t force you to do anything. It\u2019s not a government plan. The government doesn\u2019t require you to do anything. You choose your doctor. You choose your plan. If you don\u2019t want to take the offer of the plan that I want to put forward, you don\u2019t have do. You can keep what you have today, keep a high deductible, keep high premiums, keep a high co-pay, keep low benefits. But I got a better plan. And I don\u2019t think a lot of people are going to want to keep what they have today. Here\u2019s what I do: We take over Medicaid children from the states so that every child in America is covered. And in exchange, if the states want to \u2014 they\u2019re not forced to, they can choose to \u2014 they cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty. It\u2019s their choice. I think they\u2019ll choose it, because it\u2019s a net plus of $5 billion to them. We allow you \u2014 if you choose to, you don\u2019t have to \u2014 but we give you broader competition to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that senators and congressmen give themselves. If it\u2019s good enough for us, it\u2019s good enough for every American. I believe that your health care is just as important as any politician in Washington, D. C. You want to buy into it, you can. We give you broader competition. That helps lower prices. In addition to that, we\u2019re going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early. And most importantly, we give small business a 50 percent tax credit so that after we lower the costs of health care, they also get, whether they\u2019re self-employed or a small business, a lower cost to be able to cover their employees. Now, what happens is when you begin to get people covered like that \u2014 for instance in diabetes, if you diagnose diabetes early, you could save $50 billion in the health care system of America by avoiding surgery and dialysis. It works. And I\u2019m going to offer it to America."}

Anyway, let me quote the Lewin report. The Lewin report is a group of folks who are not politically affiliated. They analyzed the senator\u2019s plan. It cost $1.2 trillion. The Lewin report accurately noted that there are going to be 20 million people, over 20 million people added to government-controlled health care. It would be the largest increase in government health care ever. If you raise the Medicaid to 300 percent, it provides an incentive for small businesses not to provide private insurance to their employees. Why should they insure somebody when the government\u2019s going to insure it for them? It\u2019s estimated that 8 million people will go from private insurance to government insurance. We have a fundamental difference of opinion. I think government- run health will lead to poor-quality health, will lead to rationing, will lead to less choice. Once a health-care program ends up in a line item in the federal government budget, it leads to more controls. And just look at other countries that have tried to have federally controlled health care. They have poor-quality health care. Our health-care system is the envy of the world because we believe in making sure that the decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by officials in the nation\u2019s capital."}

I remember the 2000 campaign, people said if George W. gets elected, your check will be taken away. Well, people got their checks, and they\u2019ll continue to get their checks. There is a problem for our youngsters, a real problem. And if we don\u2019t act today, the problem will be valued in the trillions. And so I think we need to think differently. We\u2019ll honor our commitment to our seniors. But for our children and our grandchildren, we need to have a different strategy. And recognizing that, I called together a group of our fellow citizens to study the issue. It was a committee chaired by the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a Democrat. And they came up with a variety of ideas for people to look at. I believe that younger workers ought to be allowed to take some of their own money and put it in a personal savings account, because I understand that they need to get better rates of return than the rates of return being given in the current Social Security trust. And the compounding rate of interest effect will make it more likely that the Social Security system is solvent for our children and our grandchildren. I will work with Republicans and Democrats. It\u2019ll be a vital issue in my second term. It is an issue that I am willing to take on, and so I\u2019ll bring Republicans and Democrats together.

Now, my fellow Americans, that\u2019s an invitation to disaster. The CBO said very clearly that if you were to adopt the president\u2019s plan, there would be a $2 trillion hole in Social Security, because today\u2019s workers pay in to the system for today\u2019s retirees.

He\u2019s already got $3 trillion, according to The Washington Post, of expenses that he\u2019s put on the line from his convention and the promises of this campaign, none of which are paid for. Not one of them are paid for. The fact is that the president is driving the largest deficits in American history. He\u2019s broken the pay-as-you-go rules. I have a record of fighting for fiscal responsibility. In 1985, I was one of the first Democrats \u2014 broke with my party. We balanced the budget in the \u201990s.

This is the same thing we heard \u2014 remember, I appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with Tim Russert in 1990-something. We heard the same thing. We fixed it. In fact, we put together a $5. 6 trillion surplus in the \u201990s that was for the purpose of saving Social Security. If you take the tax cut that the president of the United States has given \u2014 President Bush gave to Americans in the top 1 percent of America \u2014 just that tax cut that went to the top 1 percent of America would have saved Social Security until the year 2075. The president decided to give it to the wealthiest Americans in a tax cut. Now, Alan Greenspan, who I think has done a terrific job in monetary policy, supports the president\u2019s tax cut. I don\u2019t. I support it for the middle class, not that part of it that goes to people earning more than $200,000 a year. And when I roll it back and we invest in the things that I have talked about to move our economy, we\u2019re going to grow sufficiently, it would begin to cut the deficit in half, and we get back to where we were at the end of the 1990s when we balanced the budget and paid down the debt of this country. Now, we can do that. Now, if later on after a period of time we find that Social Security is in trouble, we\u2019ll pull together the top experts of the country. We\u2019ll do exactly what we did in the 1990s. And we\u2019ll make whatever adjustment is necessary. But the first and most important thing is to start creating jobs in America. The jobs the president is creating pay $9,000 less than the jobs that we\u2019re losing. And this is the first president in 72 years to preside over an economy in America that has lost jobs, 1. 6 million jobs. Eleven other presidents \u2014 six Democrats and five Republicans \u2014 had wars, had recessions, had great difficulties; none of them lost jobs the way this president has.

Most of the tax cuts went to low- and middle-income Americans. And now the tax code is more fair. Twenty percent of the upper-income people pay about 80 percent of the taxes in America today because of how we structured the tax cuts. People listening out there know the benefits of the tax cuts we passed. If you have a child, you got tax relief. If you\u2019re married, you got tax relief. If you pay any tax at all, you got tax relief. All of which was opposed by my opponent. And the tax relief was important to spur consumption and investment to get us out of this recession. People need to remember - Six months prior to my arrival, the stock market started to go down. And it was one of the largest declines in our history. And then we had a recession and we got attacked, which cost us 1 million jobs. But we acted. I led the Congress. We passed tax relief. And now this economy is growing. We added 1. 9 million new jobs over the last 13 months. Sure, there\u2019s more work to do. But the way to make sure our economy grows is not to raise taxes on small-business owners.

I see it as a security issue, I see it as an economic issue, and I see it as a human-rights issue. We\u2019re increasing the border security of the United States. We\u2019ve got 1,000 more Border Patrol agents on the southern border. We\u2019re using new equipment. We\u2019re using unmanned vehicles to spot people coming across. And we\u2019ll continue to do so over the next four years. It\u2019s a subject I\u2019m very familiar with. After all, I was a border governor for a while. Many people are coming to this country for economic reasons. They\u2019re coming here to work. If you can make 50 cents in the heart of Mexico, for example, or make $5 here in America, $5. 15, you\u2019re going to come here if you\u2019re worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. And so in order to take pressure off the borders, in order to make the borders more secure, I believe there ought to be a temporary worker card that allows a willing worker and a willing employer to mate up, so long as there\u2019s not an American willing to do that job, to join up in order to be able to fulfill the employers\u2019 needs. That has the benefit of making sure our employers aren\u2019t breaking the law as they try to fill their workforce needs. It makes sure that the people coming across the border are humanely treated, that they\u2019re not kept in the shadows of our society, that they\u2019re able to go back and forth to see their families. See, the card, it\u2019ll have a period of time attached to it. It also means it takes pressure off the border. If somebody is coming here to work with a card, it means they\u2019re not going to have to sneak across the border. It means our border patrol will be more likely to be able to focus on doing their job. Now, it\u2019s very important for our citizens to also know that I don\u2019t believe we ought to have amnesty. I don\u2019t think we ought to reward illegal behavior. There are plenty of people standing in line to become a citizen. And we ought not to crowd these people ahead of them in line. If they want to become a citizen, they can stand in line, too. And here is where my opponent and I differ. In September 2003, he supported amnesty for illegal aliens."}

The American middle-class family isn\u2019t making it right now, Bob. And what the president said about the tax cuts has been wiped out by the increase in health care, the increase in gasoline, the increase in tuitions, the increase in prescription drugs. The fact is, the take-home pay of a typical American family as a share of national income is lower than it\u2019s been since 1929. And the take-home pay of the richest . 1 percent of Americans is the highest it\u2019s been since 1928. Under President Bush, the middle class has seen their tax burden go up and the wealthiest\u2019s tax burden has gone down. Now that\u2019s wrong. Now, with respect to immigration reform, the president broke his promise on immigration reform. He said he would reform it. Four years later he is now promising another plan. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll do: Number one, the borders are more leaking today than they were before 9\/11. The fact is, we haven\u2019t done what we need to do to toughen up our borders, and I will. Secondly, we need a guest-worker program, but if it\u2019s all we have, it\u2019s not going to solve the problem. The second thing we need is to crack down on illegal hiring. It\u2019s against the law in the United States to hire people illegally, and we ought to be enforcing that law properly. And thirdly, we need an earned-legalization program for people who have been here for a long time, stayed out of trouble, got a job, paid their taxes, and their kids are American.

It\u2019s long overdue time to raise the minimum wage. And, America, this is one of those issues that separates the president and myself. We have fought to try to raise the minimum wage in the last years. But the Republican leadership of the House and Senate won\u2019t even let us have a vote on it. We\u2019re not allowed to vote on it. They don\u2019t want to raise the minimum wage. The minimum wage is the lowest minimum wage value it has been in our nation in 50 years. If we raise the minimum wage, which I will do over several years to $7 an hour, 9. 2 million women who are trying to raise their families would earn another $3,800 a year. The president has denied 9. 2 million women $3,800 a year, but he doesn\u2019t hesitate to fight for $136,000 to a millionaire. One percent of America got $89 billion last year in a tax cut, but people working hard, playing by the rules, trying to take care of their kids, family values, that we\u2019re supposed to value so much in America \u2014 I\u2019m tired of politicians who talk about family values and don\u2019t value families. What we need to do is raise the minimum wage. We also need to hold on to equal pay. Women work for 76 cents on the dollar for the same work that men do. That\u2019s not right in America. And we had an initiative that we were working on to raise women\u2019s pay. They\u2019ve cut it off. They\u2019ve stopped it. They don\u2019t enforce these kinds of things. Now, I think that it\u2019s a matter of fundamental right that if we raise the minimum wage, 15 million Americans would be positively affected. We\u2019d put money into the hands of people who work hard, who obey the rules, who play for the American dream. And if we did that, we\u2019d have more consumption ability in America, which is what we need right now in order to kick our economy into gear. I will fight tooth and nail to pass the minimum wage."}

Listen, the No Child Left Behind Act is really a jobs act when you think about it. The No Child Left Behind Act says, \u201cWe\u2019ll raise standards. We\u2019ll increase federal spending. But in return for extra spending, we now want people to measure \u2014 states and local jurisdictions to measure to show us whether or not a child can read or write or add and subtract. \u201c You cannot solve a problem unless you diagnose the problem. And we weren\u2019t diagnosing problems. And therefore just kids were being shuffled through the school. And guess who would get shuffled through? Children whose parents wouldn\u2019t speak English as a first language just move through. Many inner-city kids just move through. We\u2019ve stopped that practice now by measuring early. And when we find a problem, we spend extra money to correct it. I remember a lady in Houston, Texas, told me, \u201cReading is the new civil right,\u201d and she\u2019s right. In order to make sure people have jobs for the 21st century, we\u2019ve got to get it right in the education system, and we\u2019re beginning to close a minority achievement gap now. You see, we\u2019ll never be able to compete in the 21st century unless we have an education system that doesn\u2019t quit on children, an education system that raises standards, an education that makes sure there\u2019s excellence in every classroom."}

I don\u2019t know how you can govern in this country when you look at New York City and you see that 50 percent of the black males there are unemployed, when you see 40 percent of Hispanic children \u2014 of black children in some cities \u2014 dropping out of high school. And yet the president who talks about No Child Left Behind refused to fully fund \u2014 by $28 billion \u2014 that particular program so you can make a difference in the lives of those young people. Now right here in Arizona, that difference would have been $131 million to the state of Arizona to help its kids be able to have better education and to lift the property tax burden from its citizens. The president reneged on his promise to fund No Child Left Behind. He\u2019ll tell you he\u2019s raised the money, and he has.

Our military is overextended. Nine out of 10 active-duty Army divisions are either in Iraq, going to Iraq or have come back from Iraq. One way or the other, they\u2019re wrapped up in it. Now, I\u2019ve proposed adding two active-duty divisions to the armed forces of the United States \u2014 one combat, one support. In addition, I\u2019m going to double the number of Special Forces so that we can fight a more effective war on terror, with less pressure on the National Guard and Reserve. And what I would like to do is see the National Guard and Reserve be deployed differently here in our own country. There\u2019s much we can do with them with respect to homeland security. We ought to be doing that. And that would relieve an enormous amount of pressure. But the most important thing to relieve the pressure on all of the armed forces is frankly to run a foreign policy that recognizes that America is strongest when we are working with real alliances, when we are sharing the burdens of the world by working through our statesmanship at the highest levels and our diplomacy to bring other nations to our side. I\u2019ve said it before, I say it again: I believe the president broke faith with the American people in the way that he took this nation to war. He said he would work through a real alliance. He said in Cincinnati we would plan carefully, we would take every precaution. Well, we didn\u2019t. And the result is our forces today are overextended. The fact is that he did not choose to go to war as a last result. And America now is paying, already $120 billion, up to $200 billion before we\u2019re finished and much more probably. And that is the result of this president taking his eye off of Osama bin Laden."}

And the prosecutions are up by about 68 percent \u2014 I believe \u2014 is the number. Neighborhoods are safer when we crack down on people who commit crimes with guns.

I put people behind bars for the rest of their life. I\u2019ve broken up organized crime. I know something about prosecuting. And most of the law enforcement agencies in America wanted that assault weapons ban. They don\u2019t want to go into a drug bust and be facing an AK-47. I was hunting in Iowa last year with a sheriff from one of the counties there, and he pointed to a house in back of us, and said, \u201cSee the house over? We just did a drug bust a week earlier, and the guy we arrested had an AK-47 lying on the bed right beside him. \u201c Because of the president\u2019s decision today, law enforcement officers will walk into a place that will be more dangerous. Terrorists can now come into America and go to a gun show and, without even a background check, buy an assault weapon today.

And I regret to say that this administration has even blocked steps that could help us move further along. I\u2019ll give you an example. I served on the Small Business Committee for a long time. I was chairman of it once. Now I\u2019m the senior Democrat on it. We used to \u2014 you know, we have a goal there for minority set-aside programs, to try to encourage ownership in the country. They don\u2019t reach those goals. They don\u2019t even fight to reach those goals. They\u2019ve tried to undo them. The fact is that in too many parts of our country, we still have discrimination. And affirmative action is not just something that applies to people of color. Some people have a mistaken view of it in America. It also is with respect to women, it\u2019s with respect to other efforts to try to reach out and be inclusive in our country. I think that we have a long way to go, regrettably. If you look at what\u2019s happened \u2014 we\u2019ve made progress, I want to say that at the same time. During the Clinton years, as you may recall, there was a fight over affirmative action. And there were many people, like myself, who opposed quotas, who felt there were places where it was overreaching. So we had a policy called \u201cMend it, don\u2019t end it. \u201cWe fixed it. And we fixed it for a reason - because there are too many people still in this country who feel the stark resistance of racism, and so we have a distance to travel. As president, I will make certain we travel it. Now, let me just share something. This president is the first president ever, I think, not to meet with the NAACP. This is a president who hasn\u2019t met with the Black Congressional Caucus. This is a president who has not met with the civil rights leadership of our country.

But we ought to have an aggressive effort to make sure people are educated, to make sure when they get out of high school there\u2019s Pell Grants available for them, which is what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve expanded Pell Grants by a million students. Do you realize today in America, we spend $73 billion to help 10 million low- and middle-income families better afford college? That\u2019s the access I believe is necessary, is to make sure every child learns to read, write, add and subtract early, to be able to build on that education by going to college so they can start their careers with a college diploma. I believe the best way to help our small businesses is not only through small-business loans, which we have increased since I\u2019ve been the president of the United States, but to unbundle government contracts so people have a chance to be able to bid and receive a contract to help get their business going. Minority ownership of businesses are up, because we created an environment for the entrepreneurial spirit to be strong. I believe part of a hopeful society is one in which somebody owns something.

More than ever, we need to be united as a country. And, like Franklin Roosevelt, I don\u2019t care whether an idea is a Republican idea or a Democrat idea. I just care whether it works for America and whether it\u2019s going to make us stronger. These are dangerous times. I believe I offer tested, strong leadership that can calm the waters of the troubled world. And I believe that we can together do things that are within the grasp of Americans. We can lift our schools up. We can create jobs that pay more than the jobs we\u2019re losing overseas. We can have health care for all Americans. We can further the cause of equality in our nation. Let me just make it clear - I will never allow any country to have a veto over our security. Just as I fought for our country as a young man, with the same passion I will fight to defend this nation that I love. And, with faith in God and with conviction in the mission of America, I believe that we can reach higher. I believe we can do better. I think the greatest possibilities of our country, our dreams and our hopes, are out there just waiting for us to grab onto them. And I ask you to embark on that journey with me. I ask you for your trust. I ask you for your help. I ask you to allow me the privilege of leading this great nation of ours, of helping us to be stronger here at home and to be respected again in the world and, most of all, to be safer forever.

And yet, because of the hard work of the American people and good policies, this economy is growing. Over the next four years, we\u2019ll make sure the economy continues to grow. We reformed our school system, and now there\u2019s an achievement gap in America that\u2019s beginning to close.

Mr. President, it\u2019s good to be with you again this evening, sir. Cheryl, the president didn\u2019t find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, so he\u2019s really turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception. And the result is that you\u2019ve been bombarded with advertisements suggesting that I\u2019ve changed a position on this or that or the other. Now, the three things they try to say I\u2019ve changed position on are the Patriot Act; I haven\u2019t. I support it. I just don\u2019t like the way John Ashcroft has applied it, and we\u2019re going to change a few things. The chairman of the Republican Party thinks we ought to change a few things. No Child Left Behind Act, I voted for it. I support it. I support the goals. But the president has underfunded it by $28 billion. Right here in St. Louis, you\u2019ve laid off 350 teachers. You\u2019re 150 \u2014 excuse me, I think it\u2019s a little more, about $100 million shy of what you ought to be under the No Child Left Behind Act to help your education system here. So I complain about that. I\u2019ve argued that we should fully funded it. The president says I\u2019ve changed my mind. I haven\u2019t changed my mind: I\u2019m going to fully fund it. So these are the differences. Now, the president has presided over an economy where we\u2019ve lost 1.6 million jobs. The first president in 72 years to lose jobs. I have a plan to put people back to work. That\u2019s not wishy- washy. I\u2019m going to close the loopholes that actually encourage companies to go overseas. The president wants to keep them open. I think I\u2019m right. I think he\u2019s wrong. I\u2019m going to give you a tax cut. The president gave the top 1 percent of income-earners in America, got $89 billion last year, more than the 80 percent of people who earn $100,000 or less all put together. I think that\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s not wishy-washy, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m fighting for, you."}

He said he thought Saddam Hussein was a grave threat, and now he said it was a mistake to remove Saddam Hussein from power. No, I can see why people think that he changes position quite often, because he does. You know, for a while he was a strong supporter of getting rid of Saddam Hussein. He saw the wisdom \u2014 until the Democrat primary came along and Howard Dean, the anti-war candidate, began to gain on him, and he changed positions. I don\u2019t see how you can lead this country in a time of war, in a time of uncertainty, if you change your mind because of politics. He just brought up the tax cut. You remember we increased that child credit by $1,000, reduced the marriage penalty, created a 10 percent tax bracket for the lower-income Americans. That\u2019s right at the middle class. He voted against it. And yet he tells you he\u2019s for a middle- class tax cut. It\u2019s \u2014 you\u2019ve got to be consistent when you\u2019re the president. There\u2019s a lot of pressures.

And obviously we hope that diplomacy works before you ever use force. The hardest decision a president makes is ever to use force. After 9\/11, we had to look at the world differently. After 9\/11, we had to recognize that when we saw a threat, we must take it seriously before it comes to hurt us. In the old days we\u2019d see a threat, and we could deal with it if we felt like it or not. But 9\/11 changed it all. I vowed to our countrymen that I would do everything I could to protect the American people. That\u2019s why we\u2019re bringing Al Qaida to justice. Seventy five percent of them have been brought to justice. That\u2019s why I said to Afghanistan: If you harbor a terrorist, you\u2019re just as guilty as the terrorist. And the Taliban is no longer in power, and Al Qaida no longer has a place to plan. And I saw a unique threat in Saddam Hussein, as did my opponent, because we thought he had weapons of mass destruction. And the unique threat was that he could give weapons of mass destruction to an organization like Al Qaida, and the harm they inflicted on us with airplanes would be multiplied greatly by weapons of mass destruction. And that was the serious, serious threat. So I tried diplomacy, went to the United Nations. But as we learned in the same report I quoted, Saddam Hussein was gaming the oil-for-food program to get rid of sanctions. He was trying to get rid of sanctions for a reason: He wanted to restart his weapons programs. We all thought there was weapons there, Robin. My opponent thought there was weapons there. That\u2019s why he called him a grave threat. I wasn\u2019t happy when we found out there wasn\u2019t weapons, and we\u2019ve got an intelligence group together to figure out why. But Saddam Hussein was a unique threat. And the world is better off without him in power. And my opponent\u2019s plans lead me to conclude that Saddam Hussein would still be in power, and the world would be more dangerous. Thank you, sir."}

Well, let me tell you straight up - I\u2019ve never changed my mind about Iraq. I do believe Saddam Hussein was a threat. I always believed he was a threat. Believed it in 1998 when Clinton was president. I wanted to give Clinton the power to use force if necessary. But I would have used that force wisely, I would have used that authority wisely, not rushed to war without a plan to win the peace. I would have brought our allies to our side. I would have fought to make certain our troops had everybody possible to help them win the mission. This president rushed to war, pushed our allies aside.

King Abdullah of Jordan said just yesterday or the day before you can\u2019t hold elections in Iraq with the chaos that\u2019s going on today. Senator Richard Lugar, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that the handling of the reconstruction aid in Iraq by this administration has been incompetent. Those are the Republican chairman\u2019s words. Senator Hagel of Nebraska said that the handling of Iraq is beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing; it\u2019s in the zone of dangerous. Those are the words of two Republicans, respected, both on the Foreign Relations Committee. Now, I have to tell you, I would do something different. I would reach out to our allies in a way that this president hasn\u2019t. He pushed them away time and again, pushed them away at the U.N., pushed them away individually. Two weeks ago, there was a meeting of the North Atlantic Council, which is the political arm of NATO. They discussed the possibility of a small training unit or having a total takeover of the training in Iraq. Did our administration push for the total training of Iraq? No. Were they silent? Yes. Was there an effort to bring all the allies together around that? No, because they\u2019ve always wanted this to be an American effort. You know, they even had the Defense Department issue a memorandum saying, \u201cDon\u2019t bother applying for assistance or for being part of the reconstruction if you weren\u2019t part of our original coalition.\u201d Now, that\u2019s not a good way to build support and reduce the risk for our troops and make America safer.

I remember when Ronald Reagan was the president; he stood on principle. Somebody called that stubborn. He stood on principle standing up to the Soviet Union, and we won that conflict. Yet at the same time, he was very \u2014 we were very unpopular in Europe because of the decisions he made. I recognize that taking Saddam Hussein out was unpopular. But I made the decision because I thought it was in the right interests of our security. You know, I\u2019ve made some decisions on Israel that\u2019s unpopular.

I believe Palestinians ought to have a state, but I know they need leadership that\u2019s committed to a democracy and freedom, leadership that would be willing to reject terrorism. I made a decision not to join the International Criminal Court in The Hague, which is where our troops could be brought to \u2014 brought in front of a judge, an unaccounted judge.

But you\u2019re absolutely correct, it is a threat, it\u2019s a huge threat. And what\u2019s interesting is, it\u2019s a threat that has grown while the president has been preoccupied with Iraq, where there wasn\u2019t a threat. If he\u2019d let the inspectors do their job and go on, we wouldn\u2019t have 10 times the numbers of forces in Iraq that we have in Afghanistan chasing Osama bin Laden. Meanwhile, while Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons, some 37 tons of what they called yellow cake, the stuff they use to make enriched uranium, while they\u2019re doing that, North Korea has moved from one bomb maybe, maybe, to four to seven bombs. For two years, the president didn\u2019t even engage with North Korea, did nothing at all, while it was growing more dangerous, despite the warnings of former Secretary of Defense William Perry, who negotiated getting television cameras and inspectors into that reactor. We were safer before President Bush came to office. Now they have the bombs and we\u2019re less safe. So what do we do? We\u2019ve got to join with the British and the French, with the Germans, who\u2019ve been involved, in their initiative. We\u2019ve got to lead the world now to crack down on proliferation as a whole. But the president\u2019s been slow to do that, even in Russia. At his pace, it\u2019s going to take 13 years to reduce and get ahold of all the loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union. I\u2019ve proposed a plan that can capture it and contain it and clean it within four years. And the president is moving to the creation of our own bunker- busting nuclear weapon. It\u2019s very hard to get other countries to give up their weapons when you\u2019re busy developing a new one. I\u2019m going to lead the world in the greatest counterproliferation effort. And if we have to get tough with Iran, believe me, we will get tough."}

He keeps talking about, \u201cLet the inspectors do their job.\u201d It\u2019s naive and dangerous to say that. That\u2019s what the Duelfer report showed. He was deceiving the inspectors. Secondly, of course we\u2019ve been involved with Iran. I fully understand the threat. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing what he suggested we do: Get the Brits, the Germans and the French to go make it very clear to the Iranians that if they expect to be a party to the world to give up their nuclear ambitions. We\u2019ve been doing that. Let me talk about North Korea. It is naive and dangerous to take a policy that he suggested the other day, which is to have bilateral relations with North Korea. Remember, he\u2019s the person who\u2019s accusing me of not acting multilaterally. He now wants to take the six-party talks we have \u2014 China, North Korea, South Korea, Russia, Japan and the United States \u2014 and undermine them by having bilateral talks. That\u2019s what President Clinton did. He had bilateral talks with the North Koreans. And guess what happened? He didn\u2019t honor the agreement. He was enriching uranium. That is a bad policy. Of course, we\u2019re paying attention to these. It\u2019s a great question about Iran. That\u2019s why in my speech to the Congress I said: There\u2019s an \u201cAxis of Evil,\u201d Iraq, Iran and North Korea, and we\u2019re paying attention to it. And we\u2019re making progress."}

I hear there\u2019s rumors on the Internets (sic) that we\u2019re going to have a draft. We\u2019re not going to have a draft, period. The all- volunteer army works. It works particularly when we pay our troops well. It works when we make sure they\u2019ve got housing, like we have done in the last military budgets. An all-volunteer army is best suited to fight the new wars of the 21st century, which is to be specialized and to find these people as they hide around the world. We don\u2019t need mass armies anymore. One of the things we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve taken the \u2014 we\u2019re beginning to transform our military. And by that I mean we\u2019re moving troops out of Korea and replacing them with more effective weapons. We don\u2019t need as much manpower on the Korean Peninsula to keep a deterrent. In Europe, we have massed troops as if the Soviet Union existed and was going to invade into Europe, but those days are over with. And so we\u2019re moving troops out of Europe and replacing it with more effective equipment. So to answer your question is, we\u2019re withdrawing, not from the world, we\u2019re withdrawing manpower so they can be stationed here in America, so there\u2019s less rotation, so life is easier on their families and therefore more likely to be \u2014 we\u2019ll be more likely to be able to keep people in the all-volunteer army. One of the more important things we\u2019re doing in this administration is transformation. There are some really interesting technologies. For instance, we\u2019re flying unmanned vehicles that can send real- time messages back to stations in the United States. That saves manpower, and it saves equipment. It also means that we can target things easier and move more quickly, which means we need to be lighter and quicker and more facile and highly trained. Now, forget all this talk about a draft. We\u2019re not going to have a draft so long as I am the president."}

The president \u2014 and this is one of the reasons why I am very proud in this race to have the support of General John Shalikashvili, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Admiral William Crowe, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; General Tony McPeak, who ran the air war for the president\u2019s father and did a brilliant job, supporting me; General Wes Clark, who won the war in Kosovo, supporting me; because they all \u2014 and General Baca, who was the head of the National Guard, supporting me. Why? Because they understand that our military is overextended under the president. Our Guard and reserves have been turned into almost active duty. You\u2019ve got people doing two and three rotations. You\u2019ve got stop-loss policies, so people can\u2019t get out when they were supposed to. You\u2019ve got a back-door draft right now. And a lot of our military are underpaid. These are families that get hurt. It hurts the middle class. It hurts communities, because these are our first responders. And they\u2019re called up. And they\u2019re over there, not over here. Now, I\u2019m going to add 40,000 active duty forces to the military, and I\u2019m going to make people feel good about being safe in our military, and not overextended, because I\u2019m going to run a foreign policy that actually does what President Reagan did, President Eisenhower did, and others.

I\u2019ve asked in my security briefings why that is, and I can\u2019t go into all the answers, et cetera, but let me say this to you. This president and his administration have told you and all of us it\u2019s not a question of when, it\u2019s a question of \u2014 excuse me \u2014 not a question of if, it\u2019s a question of when. We\u2019ve been told that. The when I can\u2019t tell you. Between the World Trade Center bombing in, what was it, 1993 or so, and the next time was five years, seven years. These people wait. They\u2019ll plan. They plot. I agree with the president that we have to go after them and get them wherever they are. I just think I can do that far more effectively, because the most important weapon in doing that is intelligence. You\u2019ve got to have the best intelligence in the world. And in order to have the best intelligence in the world to know who the terrorists are and where they are and what they\u2019re plotting, you\u2019ve got to have the best cooperation you\u2019ve ever had in the world. Now, to go back to your question, Nikki, we\u2019re not getting the best cooperation in the world today. We\u2019ve got a whole bunch of countries that pay a price for dealing with the United States of America now. I\u2019m going to change that. And I\u2019m going to put in place a better homeland security effort. Look, 95 percent of our containers coming into this country are not inspected today. When you get on an airplane, your bag is X- rayed, but the cargo hold isn\u2019t X-rayed. Do you feel safer? This president in the last debate said, \u201cWell, that would be a big tax gap if we did that.\u201d Ladies and gentlemen, it\u2019s his tax plan. He chose a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans over getting that equipment out into the homeland as fast as possible. We have bridges and tunnels that aren\u2019t being secured, chemical plants, nuclear plants that aren\u2019t secured, hospitals that are overcrowded with their emergency rooms. If we had a disaster today, could they handle it? This president chose a tax cut over homeland security. Wrong choice."}

It\u2019s also a curious thing for him to say since right after 1993 he voted to cut the intelligence budget by $7.5 billion. The best way to defend America in this world we live in is to stay on the offense. We got to be right 100 percent of the time here at home, and they got to be right once. And that\u2019s the reality. And there\u2019s a lot of good people working hard. We\u2019re doing the best we possibly can to share information. That\u2019s why the Patriot Act was important. The Patriot Act is vital, by the way. It\u2019s a tool that law enforcement now uses to be able to talk between each other. My opponent says he hadn\u2019t changed his position on it. No, but he\u2019s for weakening it. I don\u2019t think my opponent has got the right view about the world to make us safe; I really don\u2019t. First of all, I don\u2019t think he can succeed in Iraq. And if Iraq were to fail, it\u2019d be a haven for terrorists, and there would be money and the world would be much more dangerous. I don\u2019t see how you can win in Iraq if you don\u2019t believe we should be there in the first place.

Now, it may very well be here in December you\u2019ll hear me say, I think there\u2019s a safe way to do it. There are other ways to make sure drugs are cheaper. One is to speed up generic drugs to the marketplace, quicker. Pharmaceuticals were using loopholes to keep brand \u2014 brand drugs in place, and generics are much less expensive than brand drugs. And we\u2019re doing just that. Another is to pass \u2014 to get our seniors to sign up to these drug discount cards, and they\u2019re working. Wanda Blackmore I met here from Missouri, the first time she bought drugs with her drug discount card, she paid $1.14, I think it was, for about $10 worth of drugs. These cards make sense. And, you know, in 2006 seniors are going to get prescription drug coverage for the first time in Medicare. Because I went to Washington to fix problems. Medicare \u2014 the issue of Medicare used to be called \u201cMediscare.\u201d People didn\u2019t want to touch it for fear of getting hurt politically. I wanted to get something done.

Doctors practice defensive medicine because of all the frivolous lawsuits that cost our government $28 billion a year. And finally, he said he\u2019s going to have a novel health care plan. You know what it is? The federal government is going to run it. It\u2019s the largest increase in federal government health care ever. And it fits with his philosophy. That\u2019s why I told you about the award he won from the National Journal. That\u2019s what liberals do. They create government-sponsored health care. Maybe you think that makes sense.

We have a deficit because this country went into a recession. You might remember the stock market started to decline dramatically six months before I came to office, and then the bubble of the 1990s popped. And that cost us revenue. That cost us revenue. Secondly, we\u2019re at war. And I\u2019m going to spend what it takes to win the war, more than just $120 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan. We\u2019ve got to pay our troops more. We have. We\u2019ve increased money for ammunition and weapons and pay and homeland security. I just told this lady over here we spent \u2014 went from $10 billion to $30 billion to protect the homeland. I think we have an obligation to spend that kind of money. And plus, we cut taxes for everybody. Everybody got tax relief, so that they get out of the recession. I think if you raise taxes during a recession, you head to depression. I come from the school of thought that says when people have more money in their pocket during economic times, it increases demand or investment. Small businesses begin to grow, and jobs are added. We found out today that over the past 13 months, we\u2019ve added 1.9 million new jobs in the last 13 months. I proposed a plan, detailed budget, that shows us cutting the deficit in half by five years. And you\u2019re right, I haven\u2019t vetoed any spending bills, because we work together. Non-homeland, non-defense discretionary spending was raising at 15 percent a year when I got into office. And today it\u2019s less than 1 percent, because we\u2019re working together to try to bring this deficit under control. Like you, I\u2019m concerned about the deficit. But I am not going to shortchange our troops in harm\u2019s way. And I\u2019m not going to run up taxes, which will cost this economy jobs. Thank you for your question."}

They knew how to ask the American people for the right things. One percent of America, the highest one percent of income earners in America, got $89 billion of tax cut last year. One percent of America got more than the 80 percent of America that earned from $100,000 down. The president thinks it\u2019s more important to fight for that top 1 percent than to fight for fiscal responsibility and to fight for you. I want to put money in your pocket.

I can remember being in upstate New York talking to FBI agents that helped bust a Lackawanna cell up there. And they told me they could not have performed their duty, the duty we all expect of them, if they did not have the ability to communicate with each other under the Patriot Act."}

Fox the other day in New Hampshire, who\u2019s suffering from Parkinson\u2019s, and he wants us to do stem cell, embryonic stem cell. And this fellow stood up, and he was quivering. His whole body was shaking from the nerve disease, the muscular disease that he had. And he said to me and to the whole hall, he said, \u201cYou know, don\u2019t take away my hope, because my hope is what keeps me going.\u201d Chris Reeve is a friend of mine. Chris Reeve exercises every single day to keep those muscles alive for the day when he believes he can walk again, and I want him to walk again. I think we can save lives. Now, I think we can do ethically guided embryonic stem-cell research. We have 100,000 to 200,000 embryos that are frozen in nitrogen today from fertility clinics. These weren\u2019t taken from abortion or something like that. They\u2019re from a fertility clinic. And they\u2019re either going to be destroyed or left frozen. And I believe if we have the option, which scientists tell us we do, of curing Parkinson\u2019s, curing diabetes, curing, you know, some kind of a, you know, paraplegic or quadriplegic or, you know, a spinal cord injury, anything, that\u2019s the nature of the human spirit.

To destroy life to save life is \u2014 it\u2019s one of the real ethical dilemmas that we face. There is going to be hundreds of experiments off the 22 lines that now exist that are active, and hopefully we find a cure. But as well, we need to continue to pursue adult stem-cell research.

I wouldn\u2019t pick a judge who said that the Pledge of Allegiance couldn\u2019t be said in a school because it had the words \u201cunder God\u201d in it. I think that\u2019s an example of a judge allowing personal opinion to enter into the decision-making process as opposed to a strict interpretation of the Constitution. Another example would be the Dred Scott case, which is where judges, years ago, said that the Constitution allowed slavery because of personal property rights. That\u2019s a personal opinion. That\u2019s not what the Constitution says. The Constitution of the United States says we\u2019re all \u2014 you know, it doesn\u2019t say that. It doesn\u2019t speak to the equality of America.

First of all, I cannot tell you how deeply I respect the belief about life and when it begins. I\u2019m a Catholic, raised a Catholic. I was an altar boy. Religion has been a huge part of my life. It helped lead me through a war, leads me today. But I can\u2019t take what is an article of faith for me and legislate it for someone who doesn\u2019t share that article of faith, whether they be agnostic, atheist, Jew, Protestant, whatever. I can\u2019t do that. But I can counsel people. I can talk reasonably about life and about responsibility. I can talk to people, as my wife Teresa does, about making other choices, and about abstinence, and about all these other things that we ought to do as a responsible society. But as a president, I have to represent all the people in the nation. And I have to make that judgment. Now, I believe that you can take that position and not be pro- abortion, but you have to afford people their constitutional rights. And that means being smart about allowing people to be fully educated, to know what their options are in life, and making certain that you don\u2019t deny a poor person the right to be able to have whatever the constitution affords them if they can\u2019t afford it otherwise. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s important. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s important for the United States, for instance, not to have this rigid ideological restriction on helping families around the world to be able to make a smart decision about family planning. You\u2019ll help prevent AIDS. You\u2019ll help prevent unwanted children, unwanted pregnancies. You\u2019ll actually do a better job, I think, of passing on the moral responsibility that is expressed in your question. And I truly respect it."}

My answer is, we\u2019re not going to spend taxpayers\u2019 money on abortion. This is an issue that divides America, but certainly reasonable people can agree on how to reduce abortions in America. I signed the partial-birth \u2014 the ban on partial-birth abortion. It\u2019s a brutal practice. It\u2019s one way to help reduce abortions. My opponent voted against the ban. I think there ought to be parental notification laws. He\u2019s against them. I signed a bill called the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. In other words, if you\u2019re a mom and you\u2019re pregnant and you get killed, the murderer gets tried for two cases, not just one. My opponent was against that. These are reasonable ways to help promote a culture of life in America. I think it is a worthy goal in America to have every child protected by law and welcomed in life. I also think we ought to continue to have good adoption law as an alternative to abortion. And we need to promote maternity group homes, which my administration has done.

It\u2019s a very important event, and they\u2019ve done a superb job of putting it together. It\u2019s important to look at all of our developments in Iraq within the broader context of the global war on terror. And, after 9\/11, it became clear that we had to do several things to have a successful strategy to win the global war on terror, specifically that we had to go after the terrorists wherever we might find them, that we also had to go after state sponsors of terror, those who might provide sanctuary or safe harbor for terror. And we also then finally had to stand up democracies in their stead afterwards, because that was the only way to guarantee that these states would not again become safe harbors for terror or for the development of deadly weapons. Concern about Iraq specifically focused on the fact that Saddam Hussein had been, for years, listed on the state sponsor of terror, that they he had established relationships with Abu Nidal, who operated out of Baghdad; he paid $25,000 to the families of suicide bombers; and he had an established relationship with Al Qaida. Specifically, look at George Tenet, the CIA director\u2019s testimony before the Committee on Foreign Relations two years ago when he talked about a 10-year relationship. The effort that we\u2019ve mounted with respect to Iraq focused specifically on the possibility that this was the most likely nexus between the terrorists and weapons of mass destruction. The biggest threat we faced today is the possibility of terrorists smuggling a nuclear weapon or a biological agent into one of our own cities and threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans. What we did in Iraq was exactly the right thing to do. If I had it to recommend all over again, I would recommend exactly the same course of action. The world is far safer today because Saddam Hussein is in jail, his government is no longer in power. And we did exactly the right thing."}

I have not suggested there\u2019s a connection between Iraq and 9\/11, but there\u2019s clearly an established Iraqi track record with terror. And the point is that that\u2019s the place where you\u2019re most likely to see the terrorists come together with weapons of mass destruction, the deadly technologies that Saddam Hussein had developed and used over the years. Now, the fact of the matter is, the big difference here, Gwen, is they are not prepared to deal with states that sponsor terror. They\u2019ve got a very limited view about how to use U.S. military forces to defend America. We heard Senator Kerry say the other night that there ought to be some kind of global test before U.S. troops are deployed preemptively to protect the United States. That\u2019s part of a track record that goes back to the 1970s when he ran for Congress the first time and said troops should not be deployed without U.N. approval. Then, in the mid-\u201980s, he ran on the basis of cutting most of our major defense programs. In 1991, he voted against Desert Storm. It\u2019s a consistent pattern over time of always being on the wrong side of defense issues. A little tough talk in the midst of a campaign or as part of a presidential debate cannot obscure a record of 30 years of being on the wrong side of defense issues. And they give absolutely no indication, based on that record, of being wiling to go forward and aggressively pursue the war on terror with a kind of strategy that will work, that will defeat our enemies and will guarantee that the United States doesn\u2019t again get attacked by the likes of Al Qaida."}

We\u2019ve actively and aggressively pursued him. We\u2019ve captured or killed thousands of Al Qaida in various places around the world and especially in Afghanistan. We\u2019ll continue to very aggressively pursue him, and I\u2019m confident eventually we\u2019ll get him. The key to success in Afghanistan has been, again, to go in and go after the terrorists, which we\u2019ve done, and also take down the Taliban regime which allowed them to function there, in effect sponsors, if you will, of the Al Qaida organization. John Edwards, two and a half years ago, six months after we went into Afghanistan announced that it was chaotic, the situation was deteriorating, the warlords were about to take over. Here we are, two and a half years later, we\u2019re four days away from a democratic election, the first one in history in Afghanistan. We\u2019ve got 10 million voters who have registered to vote, nearly half of them women. That election will put in place a democratically elected government that will take over next December. We\u2019ve made enormous progress in Afghanistan, in exactly the right direction, in spite of what John Edwards said two and a half years ago. He just got it wrong. The fact is, as we go forward in Afghanistan, we will pursue Osama bin Laden and the terrorists as long as necessary. We\u2019re standing up Afghan security forces so they can take on responsibility for their own security. We\u2019ll keep U.S. forces there \u2014 we have about 16,000 there today \u2014 as long as necessary, to assist the Afghans in terms of dealing with their security situation. But they\u2019re making significant progress. We have President Karzai, who is in power. They have done wonders writing their own constitution for the first time ever. Schools are open. Young girls are going to school. Women are going to vote. Women are even eligible to run for office. This is major, major progress. There will be democracy in Afghanistan, make no doubt about it. Freedom is the best antidote to terror."}

When you include the Iraqi security forces that have suffered casualties, as well as the allies, they\u2019ve taken almost 50 percent of the casualties in operations in Iraq, which leaves the U.S. with 50 percent, not 90 percent. With respect to the cost, it wasn\u2019t $200 billion. You probably weren\u2019t there to vote for that. But $120 billion is, in fact, what has been allocated to Iraq. The rest of it\u2019s for Afghanistan and the global war on terror. The allies have stepped forward and agreed to reduce and forgive Iraqi debt to the tune of nearly $80 billion by one estimate. That, plus $14 billion they promised in terms of direct aid, puts the overall allied contribution financially at about $95 billion, not to the $120 billion we\u2019ve got, but, you know, better than 40 percent. So your facts are just wrong, Senator. You also have a situation where you talk about credibility. It\u2019s awfully hard to convey a sense of credibility to allies when you voted for the war and then you declared: Wrong war, wrong place, wrong time. You voted for the war, and then you voted against supporting the troops when they needed the equipment, the fuel, the spare parts and the ammunition and the body armor. You\u2019re not credible on Iraq because of the enormous inconsistencies that John Kerry and you have cited time after time after time during the course of the campaign. Whatever the political pressures of the moment requires, that\u2019s where you\u2019re at.

We need to battle them overseas so we don\u2019t have to battle them here at home. I\u2019m not challenging John Kerry\u2019s patriotism. I said in my acceptance speech in New York City at the Republican convention that we respected his service in Vietnam, and I got applause for that. We\u2019ve never criticized his patriotism. What we\u2019ve questioned is his judgment. And his judgment\u2019s flawed, and the record\u2019s there for anybody who wants to look at it. In 1984, when he ran for the Senate he opposed, or called for the elimination of a great many major weapons systems that were crucial to winning the Cold War and are important today to our overall forces. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and occupied it in 1990 and \u201991, he stood up on the floor of the Senate and voted against going in to liberate Kuwait and push Saddam Hussein back to Iraq. The problem we have is that, if you look at his record, he doesn\u2019t display the qualities of somebody who has conviction. And with respect to this particular operation, we\u2019ve seen a situation in which, first, they voted to commit the troops, to send them to war, John Edwards and John Kerry, then they came back and when the question was whether or not you provide them with the resources they needed \u2014 body armor, spare parts, ammunition \u2014 they voted against it. I couldn\u2019t figure out why that happened initially. And then I looked and figured out that what was happening was Howard Dean was making major progress in the Democratic primaries, running away with the primaries based on an anti-war record. So they, in effect, decided they would cast an anti-war vote and they voted against the troops. Now if they couldn\u2019t stand up to the pressures that Howard Dean represented, how can we expect them to stand up to Al Qaida?"}

Basically, it\u2019s an echo. You made the comment that the Gulf War coalition in \u201991 was far stronger than this. No. We had 34 countries then; we\u2019ve got 30 today. We\u2019ve got troops beside us. It\u2019s hard, after John Kerry referred to our allies as a coalition of the coerced and the bribed, to go out and persuade people to send troops and to participate in this process. You end up with a situation in which \u2014 talk about demeaning. In effect, you demean the sacrifice of our allies when you say it\u2019s the wrong war, wrong place, wrong time, and oh, by the way, send troops. Makes no sense at all. It\u2019s totally inconsistent. There isn\u2019t a plan there. Our most important ally in the war on terror, in Iraq specifically, is Prime Minister Allawi. He came recently and addressed a joint session of Congress that I presided over with the speaker of the House. And John Kerry rushed out immediately after his speech was over with, where he came and he thanked America for our contributions and our sacrifice and pledged to hold those elections in January, went out and demeaned him, criticized him, challenged his credibility.

And, Gwen, at the time, I was talking specifically about this question of unilateral sanctions. What happens when we impose unilateral sanctions is, unless there\u2019s a collective effort, then other people move in and take advantage of the situation and you don\u2019t have any impact, except to penalize American companies. We\u2019ve got sanctions on Iran now. We may well want to go to the U.N. Security Council and ask for even tougher sanctions if they don\u2019t live up to their obligations under the initial \u2014 International Atomic Energy Agency Non-Proliferation Treaty. We dealt with Iran differently than we have Iraq partly because Iran has not yet, as Iraq did, violated 12 years of resolutions by the U.N. Security Council. We\u2019re working with the Brits and the Germans and the French, who\u2019ve been negotiating with the Iranians. We recently were actively involved in a meeting with the board of governors in the International Atomic Energy Agency. And as I say, there will be a follow-up meeting in November to determine whether or not Iran\u2019s living up to their commitments and obligations. And if they aren\u2019t, my guess is then the board of governors will recommend sending the whole matter to the U.N. Security Council for the application of the international sanctions, which I think would be exactly the right way to go. We\u2019re addressing North Korea on a similar basis, working with the Chinese, the South Koreans, the Japanese and others to try to bring them around. One of the great by-products, for example, of what we did in Iraq and Afghanistan is that five days after we captured Saddam Hussein, Moammar Gadhafi in Libya came forward and announced that he was going to surrender all of his nuclear materials to the United States, which he has done. This was one of the biggest sources of proliferation in the world today in terms of the threat that was represented by that. The suppliers network that provided that, headed by Mr. A.Q. Khan, has been shut down. We\u2019ve made major progress in dealing here with a major issue with respect to nuclear proliferation. And we\u2019ll continue to press very hard on the North Koreans and the Iranians as well."}

In respect to Israel and Palestine, Gwen, the suicide bombers, in part, were generated by Saddam Hussein, who paid $25,000 to the families of suicide bombers. I personally think one of the reasons that we don\u2019t have as many suicide attacks today in Israel as we\u2019ve had in the past is because Saddam is no longer in business. We\u2019ve been strong supporters of Israel. The president stepped forward and put in place a policy basically that said we will support the establishment of two states. First president ever to say we\u2019ll establish and support a Palestinian state nextdoor to Israelis. But first, there has to be an interlocutor you can trust and deal with.

We\u2019ve, of course, been through a difficult recession, and then the aftermath of 9\/11, where we lost over a million jobs after that attack. But we think the key is to address some basic, fundamental issues that the president\u2019s already working on. I think probably the most successful thing we can do with respect to ending poverty is to get people jobs. There\u2019s no better antidote to poverty than a good, well-paying job that allows somebody to take care of their own family. To do that, we have to make America the best place in the world to do business. And that means we\u2019ve got to deal effectively with tax policy. We\u2019ve got to reduce the litigation costs that are built into our society. We\u2019ve got to provide the adequate medical care and make certain that we can, in fact, create the opportunities that are vital to that process. I\u2019d zero in, in particular, on education. I think the most important thing we can do is have a first-class public school system. I\u2019m a product of public schools. And the president, his first legislative priority was the No Child Left Behind Act. It was the first piece of legislation we introduced. We got it passed that first summer on a bipartisan basis. We even had Ted Kennedy on board for the effort. And it does several things. It establishes high standards. It, at the same time, sets up a system of testing with respect to our school system, so we can establish accountability to parents and make certain that they understand how well their students are doing. And they have the opportunity to move students out of poorly performing schools to good schools. It strikes me that that is absolutely the heart of what needs to be done from the standpoint of education. It\u2019s also important, as we go forward in the next term, we want to be able to take what we\u2019ve done for elementary education and move it into the secondary education. It\u2019s working. We\u2019ve seen reports now of a reduction in the achievement gap between majority students and minority students. We\u2019re making significant progress."}

We think that\u2019s the wrong way to go. There\u2019s a fundamental difference of opinion here. They talk about the top bracket and going after only those people in the top bracket. Well, the fact of the matter is a great many of our small businesses pay taxes under the personal income taxes rather than the corporate rate. And about 900,000 small businesses will be hit if you do, in fact, do what they want to do with the top bracket. That\u2019s not smart because seven out of 10 new jobs in America are created by small businesses. You do not want to tax them. It\u2019s a bad idea to increase the burden on those folks. The senator himself said, during the course of the primaries, that the Kerry plan would drive us deeper into deficit. Those were the senator\u2019s words about his running-mate. The fact of the matter is, the president and I will go forward to make the tax cuts permanent. That\u2019s good policy. That\u2019s what we ought to do.

We think we badly need tort reform. I was in Minnesota the other day, where I visited an aircraft manufacturing plant. It\u2019s a great success story. This is a company that started 20 years ago with nothing. Today they\u2019re the second- leading producer of piston-driven aircraft in the country. He told me that if it weren\u2019t for the increased cost of his liability insurance, in this case product liability, he could hire 200 more people in his factory. We\u2019ve built into the system enormous costs as a result of our practice with respect to litigation. We have to find ways to get a handle on it. He mentioned Medicare up 17 percent, somehow that that was something we caused. No. The 17 percent increase in Medicare premiums was the direct result of a statute adopted in 1997. John Kerry voted for it. It establishes the formula for Part B of Medicare that says, in effect, it has to cover 25 percent of the cost of the program. And the reason the money had to go into the trust fund was to make certain that we could cover those eligible for benefits. While you were in private practice in law and as a senator, you had the advantage of a special tax loophole, Subchapter S corporation, which you set up so you could avoid paying $600,000 in Medicare taxes that would have gone into the fund. And it\u2019s those kinds of loopholes that necessitate a premium increase under the law that was enacted in 1997, supported by John Kerry."}

The drug savings \u2014 drug discount card that\u2019s now available saves an estimated 15 percent to 30 percent off the cost of prescription drugs for senior citizens.

In some parts of the world, we\u2019ve got the entire, sort of, productive generation has been eliminated as a result of AIDS, all except for old folks and kids \u2014 nobody to do the basic work that runs an economy. The president has been deeply concerned about it. He has moved and proposed and gotten through the Congress authorization for $15 billion to help in the international effort, to be targeted in those places where we need to do everything we can, through a combination of education as well as providing the kinds of medicines that will help people control the infection. Here in the United States, we\u2019ve made significant progress. I have not heard those numbers with respect to African- American women. I was not aware that it was \u2014 that they\u2019re in epidemic there, because we have made progress in terms of the overall rate of AIDS infection, and I think primarily through a combination of education and public awareness as well as the development, as a result of research, of drugs that allow people to live longer lives even though they are infected \u2014 obviously we need to do more of that."}

Well, I think the important thing in picking a vice president probably varies from president to president. Different presidents approach it in different ways. When George Bush asked me to sign on, it obviously wasn\u2019t because he was worried about carrying Wyoming. We got 70 percent of the vote in Wyoming, although those three electoral votes turned out to be pretty important last time around. What he said he wanted me to do was to sign on because of my experience to be a member of the team, to help him govern, and that\u2019s exactly the way he\u2019s used me. And I think from the perspective of the nation, it\u2019s worked in our relationship, in this administration. I think it\u2019s worked in part because I made it clear that I don\u2019t have any further political aspirations myself. And I think that\u2019s been an advantage. I think it allows the president to know that my only agenda is his agenda. I\u2019m not worried about what some precinct committeemen in Iowa were thinking of me with respect to the next round of caucuses of 2008. It\u2019s a very significant responsibility when you consider that at a moment\u2019s notice you may have to take over as president of the United States and make all of those decisions. It\u2019s happened several times in our history. And I think that probably is the most important consideration in picking a vice president, somebody who could take over."}

Well, in some respects, I think, probably there are more similarities than there are differences in our personal story. I don\u2019t talk about myself very much, but I\u2019ve heard Senator Edwards, and as I listen to him, I find some similarities. I come from relatively modest circumstances. My grandfather never even went to high school. I\u2019m the first in my family to graduate from college. I carried a ticket in the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers for six years. I\u2019ve been laid off, been hospitalized without health insurance. So I have some idea of the problems that people encounter. So I think the personal stories are, in some respects, surprisingly similar. With respect to how we\u2019ve spent our careers, I obviously made a choice for public service. And I\u2019ve been at it for a good long time now, except for those periods when we lost elections. And that goes with the turf, as well, too. I\u2019m absolutely convinced that the threat we face now, the idea of a terrorist in the middle of one of our cities with a nuclear weapon, is very real and that we have to use extraordinary measures to deal with it. I feel very strongly that the significance of 9\/11 cannot be underestimated. It forces us to think in new ways about strategy, about national security, about how we structure our forces and about how we use U.S. military power. Some people say we should wait until we are attacked before we use force. I would argue we\u2019ve already been attacked. We lost more people on 9\/11 than we lost at Pearl Harbor. And I\u2019m a very strong advocate of a very aggressive policy of going after the terrorists and those who support terror."}

We had some success early on, I think, in No Child Left Behind, when we, in fact, had broad, bipartisan support. We had a lot of support for the Patriot Act, when we passed that on a bipartisan basis. Now we\u2019re seeing objection to that by the other side. All I know is to continue to try to work it. It\u2019s a disappointment, in a sense, that I remember from my earlier service when things worked much differently, when, in fact, some of my best friends in the Congress were people I worked with, like Tom Foley, who was a majority leader and later speaker of the House. One of my strongest allies in Congress when I was secretary of defense was Jack Murtha, a Democrat who is chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. We used to be able to do more together on a bipartisan basis than seems possible these days. I\u2019m not sure exactly why. I think, in part, it may be the change in the majority-minority status in the Senate has been difficult for both sides to adjust to. And the Senate, of course, has been very evenly divided, 50-50, then 51-49, then 49-51 the other way. We\u2019ll keep working at it. I think it\u2019s important for us to try. I believe that it is essential for us to do everything we can to garner as much support from the other side of the aisle as possible. We\u2019ve had support \u2014 we had our keynote address at our convention was delivered by Zell Miller. So there are some Democrats who agree with our approach. And hopefully in a second term, we\u2019ll see an improvement along those lines."}

The fact of the matter is, the most important and significant change in health care in the last several years was the Medicare reform bill this year. It\u2019s the most sweeping change in 40 years. Medicare used to pay for heart bypass surgery but didn\u2019t pay for the prescription drugs that might allow you to avoid it. The fact is that when that came up, Senator Kerry and Senator Edwards voted against it. It\u2019ll provide prescription drug benefits to 40 million senior citizens. It\u2019s a very, very significant piece of legislation."}

It\u2019s been a privilege to serve as your vice president these last four years and to work alongside President Bush to put our economy on an upward path. We\u2019ve cut taxes, added 1.7 million new jobs in the last year, and we\u2019ll continue to provide opportunities for business and for workers. We won\u2019t be happy until every American who wants to work can find a job. We believe that all Americans ought to have access to available \u2014 to medical care and that they ought to have access to the finest schools in the world. We\u2019ll do everything we can to preserve Social Security and to make certain that it\u2019s there for future generations. I\u2019ve worked for four presidents and watched two others up close, and I know that there\u2019s no such thing as a routine day in the Oval Office. We saw on 9\/11 that the next president \u2014 next decision a president has to make can affect the lives of all of us. Now we find ourselves in the midst of a conflict unlike any we\u2019ve ever known, faced with the possibility that terrorists could smuggle a deadly biological agent or a nuclear weapon into the middle of one of our own cities. That threat \u2014 and the presidential leadership needed to deal with it \u2014 is placing a special responsibility on all of you who will decide on November 2nd who will be our commander in chief. The only viable option for winning the war on terrorism is the one the president has chosen, to use the power of the United States to aggressively go after the terrorists wherever we find them and also to hold to account states that sponsor terror. Now that we\u2019ve captured or killed thousands of Al Qaida and taken down the regimes of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban, it\u2019s important that we stand up democratically elected governments as the only guarantee that they\u2019ll never again revert to terrorism or the production of deadly weapons. This is the task of our generation. And I know firsthand the strength the president brings to it. The overall outcome will depend upon the ability of the American people and the strong leadership of the president to meet all the challenges that we\u2019ll face in the days and years ahead. I\u2019m confident we can do it."}

I believe America is safest and strongest when we are leading the world and we are leading strong alliances. I\u2019ll never give a veto to any country over our security.

I think that\u2019s wrong, and I think we can do better. I have a better plan for homeland security. I have a better plan to be able to fight the war on terror by strengthening our military, strengthening our intelligence, by going after the financing more authoritatively, by doing what we need to do to rebuild the alliances, by reaching out to the Muslim world, which the president has almost not done, and beginning to isolate the radical Islamic Muslims, not have them isolate the United States of America. I know I can do a better job in Iraq. I have a plan to have a summit with all of the allies, something this president has not yet achieved, not yet been able to do to bring people to the table. We can do a better job of training the Iraqi forces to defend themselves, and I know that we can do a better job of preparing for elections.

First of all, he made the misjudgment of saying to America that he was going to build a true alliance, that he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through the inspections. In fact, he first didn\u2019t even want to do that. And it wasn\u2019t until former Secretary of State Jim Baker and General Scowcroft and others pushed publicly and said you\u2019ve got to go to the U.N., that the president finally changed his mind \u2014 his campaign has a word for that \u2014 and went to the United Nations. Now, once there, we could have continued those inspections. We had Saddam Hussein trapped. He also promised America that he would go to war as a last resort. Those words mean something to me, as somebody who has been in combat. \u201cLast resort.\u201d You\u2019ve got to be able to look in the eyes of families and say to those parents, \u201cI tried to do everything in my power to prevent the loss of your son and daughter.\u201d I don\u2019t believe the United States did that. And we pushed our allies aside. And so, today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the cost - $200 billion \u2014 $200 billion that could have been used for health care, for schools, for construction, for prescription drugs for seniors, and it\u2019s in Iraq. And Iraq is not even the center of the focus of the war on terror. The center is Afghanistan, where, incidentally, there were more Americans killed last year than the year before; where the opium production is 75 percent of the world\u2019s opium production; where 40 to 60 percent of the economy of Afghanistan is based on opium; where the elections have been postponed three times. The president moved the troops, so he\u2019s got 10 times the number of troops in Iraq than he has in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is. Does that mean that Saddam Hussein was 10 times more important than Osama bin Laden \u2014 than, excuse me, Saddam Hussein more important than Osama bin Laden? I don\u2019t think so."}

They passed the resolution that said, \u201cDisclose, disarm, or face serious consequences.\u201d I believe, when an international body speaks, it must mean what it says. Saddam Hussein had no intention of disarming. Why should he? He had 16 other resolutions and nothing took place. As a matter of fact, my opponent talks about inspectors. The facts are that he was systematically deceiving the inspectors. That wasn\u2019t going to work. That\u2019s kind of a pre-September 10th mentality, the hope that somehow resolutions and failed inspections would make this world a more peaceful place. He was hoping we\u2019d turn away.

He doesn\u2019t want U.S. leadership, however, to send mixed signals, to not stand with the Iraqi people. He believes, like I believe, that the Iraqis are ready to fight for their own freedom. They just need the help to be trained. There will be elections in January. We\u2019re spending reconstruction money. And our alliance is strong. That\u2019s the plan for victory. And when Iraq if free, America will be more secure."}

And he rushed the war in Iraq without a plan to win the peace. Now, that is not the judgment that a president of the United States ought to make. You don\u2019t take America to war unless have the plan to win the peace. You don\u2019t send troops to war without the body armor that they need. I\u2019ve met kids in Ohio, parents in Wisconsin places, Iowa, where they\u2019re going out on the Internet to get the state-of-the-art body gear to send to their kids. Some of them got it for a birthday present. I think that\u2019s wrong. Humvees \u2014 10,000 out of 12,000 Humvees that are over there aren\u2019t armored.

And we got weapons of mass destruction crossing the border every single day, and they\u2019re blowing people up. And we don\u2019t have enough troops there."}

KERRY (MA), DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE","Moderators":"JIM LEHRER","Speaker":"KERRY","Text":"Jim, let me tell you exactly what I\u2019ll do. And there are a long list of thing. First of all, what kind of mixed message does it send when you have $500 million going over to Iraq to put police officers in the streets of Iraq, and the president is cutting the COPS program in America? What kind of message does it send to be sending money to open firehouses in Iraq, but we\u2019re shutting firehouses who are the first- responders here in America. The president hasn\u2019t put one nickel, not one nickel into the effort to fix some of our tunnels and bridges and most exposed subway systems. That\u2019s why they had to close down the subway in New York when the Republican Convention was there. We hadn\u2019t done the work that ought to be done. The president \u2014 95 percent of the containers that come into the ports, right here in Florida, are not inspected. Civilians get onto aircraft, and their luggage is X-rayed, but the cargo hold is not X- rayed. Does that make you feel safer in America? This president thought it was more important to give the wealthiest people in America a tax cut rather than invest in homeland security. Those aren\u2019t my values. I believe in protecting America first. And long before President Bush and I get a tax cut \u2014 and that\u2019s who gets it \u2014 long before we do, I\u2019m going to invest in homeland security and I\u2019m going to make sure we\u2019re not cutting COPS programs in America and we\u2019re fully staffed in our firehouses and that we protect the nuclear and chemical plants. The president also unfortunately gave in to the chemical industry, which didn\u2019t want to do some of the things necessary to strengthen our chemical plant exposure. And there\u2019s an enormous undone job to protect the loose nuclear materials in the world that are able to get to terrorists. That\u2019s a whole other subject, but I see we still have a little bit more time. Let me just quickly say, at the current pace, the president will not secure the loose material in the Soviet Union \u2014 former Soviet Union for 13 years. I\u2019m going to do it in four years. And we\u2019re going to keep it out of the hands of terrorists."}

It\u2019s like a huge tax gap. Anyway, that\u2019s for another debate. My administration has tripled the amount of money we\u2019re spending on homeland security to $30 billion a year. My administration worked with the Congress to create the Department of Homeland Security so we could better coordinate our borders and ports. We\u2019ve got 1,000 extra border patrol on the southern border; want 1,000 on the northern border. We\u2019re modernizing our borders. We spent $3.1 billion for fire and police, $3.1 billion. We\u2019re doing our duty to provide the funding. But the best way to protect this homeland is to stay on the offense. You know, we have to be right 100 percent of the time. And the enemy only has to be right once to hurt us. There\u2019s a lot of good people working hard. And by the way, we\u2019ve also changed the culture of the FBI to have counterterrorism as its number one priority. We\u2019re communicating better. We\u2019re going to reform our intelligence services to make sure that we get the best intelligence possible. The Patriot Act is vital \u2014 is vital that the Congress renew the Patriot Act which enables our law enforcement to disrupt terror cells. But again, I repeat to my fellow citizens, the best way to protection is to stay on the offense."}

KERRY (MA), DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE","Moderators":"JIM LEHRER","Speaker":"BUSH","Text":"Let me first tell you that the best way for Iraq to be safe and secure is for Iraqi citizens to be trained to do the job. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019ve got 100,000 trained now, 125,000 by the end of this year, 200,000 by the end of next year. That is the best way. We\u2019ll never succeed in Iraq if the Iraqi citizens do not want to take matters into their own hands to protect themselves. I believe they want to. Prime Minister Allawi believes they want to. And so the best indication about when we can bring our troops home \u2014 which I really want to do, but I don\u2019t want to do so for the sake of bringing them home; I want to do so because we\u2019ve achieved an objective \u2014 is to see the Iraqis perform and to see the Iraqis step up and take responsibility. And so, the answer to your question is - When our general is on the ground and Ambassador Negroponte tells me that Iraq is ready to defend herself from these terrorists, that elections will have been held by then, that their stability and that they\u2019re on their way to, you know, a nation that\u2019s free; that\u2019s when. And I hope it\u2019s as soon as possible. But I know putting artificial deadlines won\u2019t work. My opponent at one time said, \u201cWell, get me elected, I\u2019ll have them out of there in six months.\u201d You can\u2019t do that and expect to win the war on terror. My message to our troops is, \u201cThank you for what you\u2019re doing. We\u2019re standing with you strong. We\u2019ll give you all the equipment you need. And we\u2019ll get you home as soon as the mission\u2019s done, because this is a vital mission.\u201d A free Iraq will be an ally in the war on terror, and that\u2019s essential. A free Iraq will set a powerful example in the part of the world that is desperate for freedom. A free Iraq will help secure Israel. A free Iraq will enforce the hopes and aspirations of the reformers in places like Iran. A free Iraq is essential for the security of this country."}

You know, it\u2019s interesting. When I was in a rope line just the other day, coming out here from Wisconsin, a couple of young returnees were in the line, one active duty, one from the Guard. And they both looked at me and said: We need you. You\u2019ve got to help us over there. Now I believe there\u2019s a better way to do this. You know, the president\u2019s father did not go into Iraq, into Baghdad, beyond Basra. And the reason he didn\u2019t is, he said \u2014 he wrote in his book \u2014 because there was no viable exit strategy. And he said our troops would be occupiers in a bitterly hostile land. That\u2019s exactly where we find ourselves today. There\u2019s a sense of American occupation. The only building that was guarded when the troops when into Baghdad was the oil ministry. We didn\u2019t guard the nuclear facilities. We didn\u2019t guard the foreign office, where you might have found information about weapons of mass destruction. We didn\u2019t guard the borders. Almost every step of the way, our troops have been left on these extraordinarily difficult missions. I know what it\u2019s like to go out on one of those missions when you don\u2019t know what\u2019s around the corner. And I believe our troops need other allies helping. I\u2019m going to hold that summit. I will bring fresh credibility, a new start, and we will get the job done right."}

I believe that we have to win this. The president and I have always agreed on that. And from the beginning, I did vote to give the authority, because I thought Saddam Hussein was a threat, and I did accept that intelligence. But I also laid out a very strict series of things we needed to do in order to proceed from a position of strength. Then the president, in fact, promised them. He went to Cincinnati and he gave a speech in which he said, \u201cWe will plan carefully. We will proceed cautiously. We will not make war inevitable. We will go with our allies.\u201d He didn\u2019t do any of those things. They didn\u2019t do the planning. They left the planning of the State Department in the State Department desks. They avoided even the advice of their own general. General Shinsheki, the Army chief of staff, said you\u2019re going to need several hundred thousand troops. Instead of listening to him, they retired him. The terrorism czar, who has worked for every president since Ronald Reagan, said, \u201cInvading Iraq in response to 9\/11 would be like Franklin Roosevelt invading Mexico in response to Pearl Harbor.\u201d That\u2019s what we have here. And what we need now is a president who understands how to bring these other countries together to recognize their stakes in this. They do have stakes in it. They\u2019ve always had stakes in it. The Arab countries have a stake in not having a civil war. The European countries have a stake in not having total disorder on their doorstep. But this president hasn\u2019t even held the kind of statesman-like summits that pull people together and get them to invest in those states. In fact, he\u2019s done the opposite. He pushed them away. When the Secretary General Kofi Annan offered the United Nations, he said, \u201cNo, no, we\u2019ll go do this alone.\u201d To save for Halliburton the spoils of the war, they actually issued a memorandum from the Defense Department saying, \u201cIf you weren\u2019t with us in the war, don\u2019t bother applying for any construction.\u201d That\u2019s not a way to invite people."}

You can\u2019t expect to build an alliance when you denigrate the contributions of those who are serving side by side with American troops in Iraq. Plus, he says the cornerstone of his plan to succeed in Iraq is to call upon nations to serve. So what\u2019s the message going to be: \u201cPlease join us in Iraq. For a grand diversion. Join us for a war that is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time?\u201d I know how these people think. I deal with them all the time. I sit down with the world leaders frequently and talk to them on the phone frequently. They\u2019re not going to follow somebody who says, \u201cThis is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d They\u2019re not going to follow somebody who says this is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time. They\u2019re not going to follow somebody whose core convictions keep changing because of politics in America. And finally, he says we ought to have a summit. Well, there are summits being held. Japan is going to have a summit for the donors; $14 billion pledged. And Prime Minister Koizumi is going to call countries to account, to get them to contribute.

First of all, we all know that in his state of the union message, he told Congress about nuclear materials that didn\u2019t exist. We know that he promised America that he was going to build this coalition. I just described the coalition. It is not the kind of coalition we were described when we were talking about voting for this. The president said he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through that full process. He didn\u2019t. He cut if off, sort of arbitrarily. And we know that there were further diplomatic efforts under way. They just decided the time for diplomacy is over and rushed to war without planning for what happens afterwards. Now, he misled the American people in his speech when he said we will plan carefully. They obviously didn\u2019t. He misled the American people when he said we\u2019d go to war as a last resort. We did not go as a last resort. And most Americans know the difference. Now, this has cost us deeply in the world. I believe that it is important to tell the truth to the American people. I\u2019ve worked with those leaders the president talks about, I\u2019ve worked with them for 20 years, for longer than this president. And I know what many of them say today, and I know how to bring them back to the table.

We need to be smarter about now we wage a war on terror. We need to deny them the recruits. We need to deny them the safe havens. We need to rebuild our alliances. I believe that Ronald Reagan, John Kennedy, and the others did that more effectively, and I\u2019m going to try to follow in their footsteps."}

There\u2019s only 25 percent of the people in there. They can\u2019t have an election right now. The president\u2019s not getting the job done.

I didn\u2019t say I would bring troops out in six months. I said, if we do the things that I\u2019ve set out and we are successful, we could begin to draw the troops down in six months. And I think a critical component of success in Iraq is being able to convince the Iraqis and the Arab world that the United States doesn\u2019t have long-term designs on it. As I understand it, we\u2019re building some 14 military bases there now, and some people say they\u2019ve got a rather permanent concept to them. When you guard the oil ministry, but you don\u2019t guard the nuclear facilities, the message to a lot of people is maybe, \u201cWow, maybe they\u2019re interested in our oil.\u201d Now, the problem is that they didn\u2019t think these things through properly. And these are the things you have to think through. What I want to do is change the dynamics on the ground. And you have to do that by beginning to not back off of the Fallujahs and other places, and send the wrong message to the terrorists. You have to close the borders. You\u2019ve got to show you\u2019re serious in that regard. But you\u2019ve also got to show that you are prepared to bring the rest of the world in and share the stakes. I will make a flat statement - The United States of America has no long-term designs on staying in Iraq. And our goal in my administration would be to get all of the troops out of there with a minimal amount you need for training and logistics as we do in some other countries in the world after a war to be able to sustain the peace. But that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to win the peace, by rapidly training the Iraqis themselves. Even the administration has admitted they haven\u2019t done the training, because they came back to Congress a few weeks ago and asked for a complete reprogramming of the money. Now what greater admission is there, 16 months afterwards. \u201cOops, we haven\u2019t done the job. We have to start to spend the money now. Will you guys give us permission to shift it over into training?\u201d"}

Let me say \u2014 I certainly hope so. Before I was sworn in, the policy of this government was to have bilateral negotiations with North Korea. And we signed an agreement with North Korea that my administration found out that was not being honored by the North Koreans. And so I decided that a better way to approach the issue was to get other nations involved, just besides us. And in Crawford, Texas, Jiang Zemin and I agreed that the nuclear-weapons-free peninsula, Korean Peninsula, was in his interest and our interest and the world\u2019s interest. And so we began a new dialogue with North Korea, one that included not only the United States, but now China. And China\u2019s a got a lot of influence over North Korea, some ways more than we do. As well, we included South Korea, Japan and Russia. So now there are five voices speaking to Kim Jong Il, not just one. And so if Kim Jong Il decides again to not honor an agreement, he\u2019s not only doing injustice to America, he\u2019d be doing injustice to China, as well. And I think this will work. It\u2019s not going to work if we open up a dialogue with Kim Jong Il. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what he wants. He wants to unravel the six- party talks, or the five-nation coalition that\u2019s sending him a clear message. On Iran, I hope we can do the same thing, continue to work with the world to convince the Iranian mullahs to abandon their nuclear ambitions. We worked very closely with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Great Britain, who have been the folks delivering the message to the mullahs that if you expect to be part of the world of nations, get rid of your nuclear programs. The IAEA is involved. There\u2019s a special protocol recently been passed that allows for inspections. I hope we can do it. And we\u2019ve got a good strategy."}

If they weren\u2019t willing to work a deal, then we could have put sanctions together. The president did nothing. With respect to North Korea, the real story - We had inspectors and television cameras in the nuclear reactor in North Korea. Secretary Bill Perry negotiated that under President Clinton. And we knew where the fuel rods were. And we knew the limits on their nuclear power. Colin Powell, our secretary of state, announced one day that we were going to continue the dialog of working with the North Koreans. The president reversed it publicly while the president of South Korea was here. And the president of South Korea went back to South Korea bewildered and embarrassed because it went against his policy. And for two years, this administration didn\u2019t talk at all to North Korea. While they didn\u2019t talk at all, the fuel rods came out, the inspectors were kicked out, the television cameras were kicked out. And today, there are four to seven nuclear weapons in the hands of North Korea. That happened on this president\u2019s watch.

They\u2019ve got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing. And that\u2019s going to require more than is on the table today. I also believe that it is \u2014 one of the reasons we can\u2019t do it is we\u2019re overextended. Ask the people in the armed forces today. We\u2019ve got Guards and Reserves who are doing double duties. We\u2019ve got a backdoor draft taking place in America today: people with stop-loss programs where they\u2019re told you can\u2019t get out of the military; nine out of our 10 active duty divisions committed to Iraq one way or the other, either going, coming or preparing. So this is the way the president has overextended the United States. That\u2019s why, in my plan, I add two active duty divisions to the United States Army, not for Iraq, but for our general demands across the globe. I also intend to double the number of special forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect fighting the terrorists around the world. And if we do that, then we have the ability to be able to respond more rapidly. But I\u2019ll tell you this, as president, if it took American forces to some degree to coalesce the African Union, I\u2019d be prepared to do it because we could never allow another Rwanda. It\u2019s a moral responsibility for us and the world."}

We have committed $200 million worth of aid. We\u2019re the leading donor in the world to help the suffering people there. We will commit more over time to help. We were very much involved at the U.N. on the sanction policy of the Bashir government in the Sudan. Prior to Darfur, Ambassador Jack Danforth had been negotiating a north-south agreement that we would have hoped would have brought peace to the Sudan. I agree with my opponent that we shouldn\u2019t be committing troops. We ought to be working with the African Union to do so \u2014 precisely what we did in Liberia. We helped stabilize the situation with some troops, and when the African Union came, we moved them out. My hope is that the African Union moves rapidly to help save lives. And fortunately the rainy season will be ending shortly, which will make it easier to get aid there and help the long-suffering people there."}

There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. My concerns about the senator is that, in the course of this campaign, I\u2019ve been listening very carefully to what he says, and he changes positions on the war in Iraq. He changes positions on something as fundamental as what you believe in your core, in your heart of hearts, is right in Iraq. You cannot lead if you send mixed messages. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our troops. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our allies. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to the Iraqi citizens. And that\u2019s my biggest concern about my opponent. I admire his service.

I wrote a book about it several years ago \u2014 six, seven years ago \u2014 called \u201cThe New War,\u201d which saw the difficulties of this international criminal network. And back then, we intercepted a suitcase in a Middle Eastern country with nuclear materials in it. And the black market sale price was about $250 million. Now, there are terrorists trying to get their hands on that stuff today. And this president, I regret to say, has secured less nuclear material in the last two years since 9\/11 than we did in the two years preceding 9\/11. We have to do this job. And to do the job, you can\u2019t cut the money for it. The president actually cut the money for it. You have to put the money into it and the funding and the leadership. And part of that leadership is sending the right message to places like North Korea. Right now the president is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunker-busting nuclear weapons. The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons. It doesn\u2019t make sense. You talk about mixed messages. We\u2019re telling other people, \u201cYou can\u2019t have nuclear weapons,\u201d but we\u2019re pursuing a new nuclear weapon that we might even contemplate using. Not this president.

And we\u2019re going to get the job of containing all of that nuclear material in Russia done in four years. And we\u2019re going to build the strongest international network to prevent nuclear proliferation. This is the scale of what President Kennedy set out to do with the nuclear test ban treaty.

And that\u2019s why proliferation is one of the centerpieces of a multi-prong strategy to make the country safer. My administration started what\u2019s called the Proliferation Security Initiative. Over 60 nations involved with disrupting the trans-shipment of information and\/or weapons of mass destruction materials. And we\u2019ve been effective. We busted the A.Q. Khan network. This was a proliferator out of Pakistan that was selling secrets to places like North Korea and Libya. We convinced Libya to disarm. It\u2019s a central part of dealing with weapons of mass destruction and proliferation. I\u2019ll tell you another way to help protect America in the long run is to continue with missile defenses.

It sort of brought home the transition to democracy that Russia was trying to make. I regret what\u2019s happened in these past months. And I think it goes beyond just the response to terror. Mr. Putin now controls all the television stations. His political opposition is being put in jail.

But we have a different set of convictions about how we make our country stronger here at home and respected again in the world.

I believe we can be successful. I\u2019m not talking about leaving. I\u2019m talking about winning. And we need a fresh start, a new credibility, a president who can bring allies to our side. I also have a plan to win the war on terror, funding homeland security, strengthening our military, cutting our finances, reaching out to the world, again building strong alliances. I believe America\u2019s best days are ahead of us because I believe that the future belongs to freedom, not to fear. That\u2019s the country that I\u2019m going to fight for.

I would like to thank Governor Bush for participating, and I would like to say I\u2019m happy to be here with Tipper and our family. I have actually not questioned Governor Bush\u2019s experience. I have questioned his proposals. And here is why. I think this is a very important moment for our country. We have achieved extraordinary prosperity. And in this election, America has to make an important choice. Will we use our prosperity to enrich not just the few, but all of our families? I believe we have to make the right and responsible choices. If I\u2019m entrusted with the presidency, here are the choices that I will make. I will balance the budget every year. I will pay down the national debt. I will put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox and protect them. And I will cut taxes for middle-class families. I believe it\u2019s important to resist the temptation to squander our surplus. If we make the right choices, we can have a prosperity that endures and enriches all of our people. If I\u2019m entrusted with the presidency, I will help parents and strengthen families because, you know, if we have prosperity that grows and grows, we still won\u2019t be successful unless we strengthen families by, for example, ensuring that children can always go to schools that are safe. By giving parents the tools to protect their children against cultural pollution. I will make sure that we invest in our country and our families. And I mean investing in education, health care, the environment, and middle-class tax cuts and retirement security. That is my agenda and that is why I think that it\u2019s not just a question of experience."}

One-quarter of the surplus for important projects, and I want to send one-quarter of the surplus back to the people who pay the bills. I want everybody who pays taxes to have their tax rates cut. And that stands in contrast to my worthy opponent\u2019s plan, which will increase the size of government dramatically. His plan is three times larger than President Clinton\u2019s proposed plan eight years ago. It is a plan that will have 200 new programs \u2014 expanded programs and creates 20,000 new bureaucrats.

I said that his tax cut plan, for example, raises the question of whether it\u2019s the right choice for the country. And let me give you an example of what I mean. Under Governor Bush\u2019s tax cut proposal, he would spend more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of the new spending that he proposes for education, health care, prescription drugs and national defense all combined. Now, I think those are the wrong priorities. Now, under my proposal, for every dollar that I propose in spending for things like education and health care, I will put another dollar into middle class tax cuts. And for every dollar that I spend in those two categories, I\u2019ll put $2 toward paying down the national debt. I think it\u2019s very important to keep the debt going down and completely eliminate it. And I also think it\u2019s very important to go to the next stage of welfare reform. Our country has cut the welfare rolls in half. I fought hard from my days in the Senate and as vice president to cut the welfare rolls and we\u2019ve moved millions of people in America into good jobs. But it\u2019s now time for the next stage of welfare reform, and include fathers and not only mothers."}

People need to know that over the next ten years it is going to be $25 trillion of revenue that comes into our treasurey and we anticipate spending $21 trillion. And my plan say why don\u2019t we pass 1.3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills? Surely we can afford 5% of the $25 trillion that are coming into the treasury to the hard working people that pay the bills. There is a difference of opinion. My opponent thinks the government \u2014 the surplus is the government\u2019s money. That\u2019s not what I think. I think it\u2019s the hard-working people of America\u2019s money and I want to share some of that money with you so you have more money to build and save and dream for your families. It\u2019s a difference of opinion. It\u2019s a difference between government making decisions for you and you getting more of your money to make decisions for yourself."}

I know that. The governor used the phrase phony numbers, but if you look at the plan and add the numbers up, these numbers are correct. He spends more money for tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of his new spending proposals for health care, prescription drugs, education and national defense all combined. I agree that the surplus is the American people\u2019s money, it\u2019s your money. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t think we should give nearly half of it to the wealthiest 1%, because the other 99% have had an awful lot to do with building the surplus in our prosperity."}
{"Title":"October 3, 2000 Transcript","Debate":"The First Gore-Bush Presidential Debate","Date":970531200000,"Participants":"Gore-Bush","Moderators":"MODERATOR","Speaker":"BUSH","Text":"Actually what I\u2019ve said, Jim. I\u2019ve said that eight years ago they campaigned on prescription drugs for seniors. And four years ago they campaigned on getting prescription drugs for seniors. And now they\u2019re campaigning on getting prescription drugs for seniors. It seems like they can\u2019t get it done. Now, they may blame other folks, but it\u2019s time to get somebody in Washington who is going to work with both Republicans and Democrats to get some positive things done when it comes to our seniors. And so what I\u2019ve said is that there\u2019s been some missed opportunities. They\u2019ve had a chance. They\u2019ve had a chance to form consensus. I\u2019ve got a plan on Medicare, for example, that\u2019s a two-stage plan that says we\u2019ll have immediate help for seniors and what I call immediate Helping Hand, a $48 billion program. But I also want to say to seniors, if you\u2019re happy with Medicare the way it is, fine, you can stay in the program. But we\u2019re going to give you additional choices like they give federal employees in the federal employee health plan. They have a variety of choices to choose, so should seniors. And my point has been, as opposed to politicizing an issue like Medicare, in other words, holding it up as an issue, hoping somebody bites it and try to clobber them over the head with it for political purposes, this year, in the year 2000, it\u2019s time to get it done once and for all. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been critical about the administration for. Same with Social Security. I think there was a good opportunity to bring Republicans and Democrats together to reform the Social Security system so seniors will never go without. Those on Social Security today will have their promise made, but also to give younger workers the option at their choice of being able to manage some of their own money in the private sector to make sure there\u2019s a Social Security system around tomorrow. There are a lot of young workers at our rallies we go to that when they hear I\u2019ll trust them at their option to be able to manage, under certain guidelines, some of their own money to get a better rate of return so that they\u2019ll have a retirement plan in the future, they begin to nod their heads and they want a different attitude in Washington."}
{"Title":"October 3, 2000 Transcript","Debate":"The First Gore-Bush Presidential Debate","Date":970531200000,"Participants":"Gore-Bush","Moderators":"MODERATOR","Speaker":"GORE","Text":"Well, Jim, under my plan all seniors will get prescription drugs under Medicare. The governor has described Medicare as a government HMO. It\u2019s not, and let me explain the difference. Under the Medicare prescription drug proposal I\u2019m making, here is how it works, you go to your own doctor. Your doctor chooses your prescription. No HMO or insurance company can take those choices away from you. Then you go to your own pharmacy. You fill the prescription and Medicare pays half the cost. If you\u2019re in a very poor family or if you have very high costs, Medicare will pay all the costs, a $25 premium, and much better benefits than you can possibly find in the private sector. Now here is the contrast. 95% of all seniors would get no help whatsoever under my opponent\u2019s plan for the first four or five years. Now, one thing I don\u2019t understand, Jim, is why is it that the wealthiest 1% get their tax cuts the first year, but 95% of seniors have to wait four to five years before they get a single penny?"}
{"Title":"October 3, 2000 Transcript","Debate":"The First Gore-Bush Presidential Debate","Date":970531200000,"Participants":"Gore-Bush","Moderators":"MODERATOR","Speaker":"BUSH","Text":"I guess my answer to that is the man is running on Medi-scare. Trying to frighten people in the voting booth. It\u2019s just not the way I think and it\u2019s not my intentions and not my plan. I want all seniors to have prescription drugs in Medicare. We need to reform Medicare. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been opportunity to do so but this administration has failed to do it. And so seniors will have not only a Medicare plan where the poor seniors will have prescription drugs paid for, but there will be a variety of options. The current system today has meant a lot for a lot of seniors, and I really appreciate the intentions of the current system as I mentioned. If you\u2019re happy with the system you can stay in it. But there are a lot of procedures that haven\u2019t kept up in Medicare with the current times. No prescription drug benefits, no drug therapy, no preventative medicines, no vision care. We need to have a modern system to help seniors, and the idea of supporting a federally controlled 132,000-page document bureaucracy as being a compassionate way for seniors, and the only compassionate source of care for seniors is not my vision. I believe we ought to give seniors more options. I believe we ought to make the system work better. I know this. I know it will require a different kind of leader to go to Washington to say to both Republicans and Democrats, let\u2019s come together. You\u2019ve had your chance, Vice President, you\u2019ve been there for eight years and nothing has been done. My point is, is that my plan not only trusts seniors with options, my plan sets aside $3.4 trillion for Medicare over the next ten years. My plan also says it requires a new approach in Washington, D.C. It\u2019s going to require somebody who can work across the partisan divide."}
{"Title":"October 3, 2000 Transcript","Debate":"The First Gore-Bush Presidential Debate","Date":970531200000,"Participants":"Gore-Bush","Moderators":"MODERATOR","Speaker":"GORE","Text":"If I could respond to that. Under my plan I will put Medicare in an iron clad lockbox and prevent the money from being used for anything other than Medicare. The governor has declined to endorse that idea even though the Republican as well as Democratic leaders in Congress have endorsed it. I would be interested to see if he would say this evening he\u2019ll put Medicare in a lockbox. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think he will because under his plan if you work out the numbers \u00c2 $100 billion comes out of Medicare just for the wealthiest 1% in the tax cut. Now here is the difference. Some people who say the word reform actually mean cuts. Under the governor\u2019s plan, if you kept the same fee for service that you have now under Medicare, your premiums would go up by between 18% and 47%, and that is the study of the Congressional plan that he\u2019s modeled his proposal on by the Medicare actuaries. Let me give you one quick example. There is a man here tonight named George McKinney from Milwaukee. He\u2019s 70 years old, has high blood pressure, his wife has heart trouble. They have an income of $25,000 a year. They can\u2019t pay for their prescription drugs and so they\u2019re some of the ones that go to Canada regularly in order to get their prescription drugs. Under my plan, half of their costs would be paid right away. Under Governor Bush\u2019s plan, they would get not one penny for four to five years and then they would be forced to go into an HMO or to an insurance company and ask them for coverage, but there would be no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the terms and conditions."}

The federal government should take no more than a third of anybody\u2019s check. But I also dropped the bottom rate from 15% to 10%. Because by far the vast majority of the help goes to people at the bottom end of the economic ladder. If you\u2019re a family of four in Massachusetts, making $50,000, you get a 50% cut in the federal income taxes you pay. It\u2019s from $4000 to about $2000.

{"Title":"October 3, 2000 Transcript","Debate":"The First Gore-Bush Presidential Debate","Date":970531200000,"Participants":"Gore-Bush","Moderators":"MODERATOR","Speaker":"GORE","Text":"Excellent question. And here is the simple difference. My plan has not only a short-term component, but also a long-term component. And it focuses not only on increasing the supply, which I think we have to do, but also on working on the consumption side. Now, in the short-term we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price from OPEC when they want to raise the price. And in the long-term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy. And domestic sources that are cleaner and better. And I\u2019m proposing a plan that will give tax credits and tax incentives for the rapid development of new kinds of cars and trucks and buses and factories and boilers and furnaces that don\u2019t have as much pollution, that don\u2019t burn as much energy, and that help us get out on the cutting edge of the new technologies that will create millions of new jobs. Because, when we sell these new products here, we\u2019ll then be able to sell them overseas. There is a ravenous demand for them overseas. Now, another big difference is Governor Bush is proposing to open up some of our most precious environmental treasures, like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for the big oil companies to go in and start producing oil there. I think that is the wrong choice. It would only give us a few months\u2019 worth of oil and the oil wouldn\u2019t start flowing for many years into the future. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a fair price to pay to destroy precious parts of America\u2019s environment. We have to bet on the future and move beyond the current technologies to have a whole new generation of more efficient, cleaner, energy technology."}
{"Title":"October 3, 2000 Transcript","Debate":"The First Gore-Bush Presidential Debate","Date":970531200000,"Participants":"Gore-Bush","Moderators":"MODERATOR","Speaker":"BUSH","Text":"It\u2019s an issue I know a lot about. I was a small oil person for a while in west Texas. This is an administration that\u2019s had no plan. And all of a sudden the results of having no plan have caught up with America. First and foremost we have to fully fund LIHEAP which is a way to help low income folks, particularly here in the east to pay for high fuel bills. Secondly, we need an active exploration program in America. The only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home. You bet I want to open up a small part of Alaska. When that field is online it will produce one million barrels a day. Today we import one million barrels from Saddam Hussein. I would rather that a million come from our own hemisphere, our own country as opposed to Saddam Hussein. I want to build more pipelines to move natural gas throughout this hemisphere. I want to develop the coal resources in America. Have clean coal technologies. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got abundant supplies of energy here in America and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d better get after it, we better start exploring it or otherwise we\u2019ll be in deep trouble in the future because of our dependency upon foreign sources of crude."}

I\u2019m for doing something both on the supply side and production side and on the consumption side. Let me say, that I found one thing in Governor Bush\u2019s answer that we certainly agree on, and that\u2019s the low income heating assistance program. I commend you for supporting that. I worked to get $400 million just a couple of weeks ago. And to establish a permanent home heating oil reserve here in the northeast. Now, as for the proposals that I\u2019ve worked for for renewables and conservation and efficiencies and new technologies. The fact is for the last few years in the Congress, we\u2019ve faced a lot of opposition to them. They\u2019ve only approved about 10% of the agenda I\u2019ve helped to send up there. I think we need to get serious about this energy crisis, both in the Congress and in the White House, and if you entrust me with the presidency, I will tackle this problem and focus on new technologies that will make us less dependent on big oil or foreign oil."}

Secondly the difference is we need to explore at home. And the vice president doesn\u2019t believe in exploration in Alaska. There\u2019s a lot of shut-in gas that we need to be moving out of Alaska by pipeline. There\u2019s an interesting issue up in the northwest as well. Do we remove dams that produce hydroelectric energy? I\u2019m against removing dams in the northwest. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know where the vice president stands but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a renewable energy source of energy. We need to keep that in line. I was in coal country in West Virginia yesterday. There is an abundant supply of coal in America. I know we can do a better job of clean coal technologies. I\u2019m going to ask the Congress for $2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal technologies in the world. My answer to you is in the short-term we need to get after it here in America. We need to explore our resources and we need to develop our reservoirs of domestic production. We also need to have a hemispheric energy policy where Canada, Mexico and the United States come together. I brought this up recently with Vincent Fox the newly elected president in Mexico, he\u2019s a man I know from Mexico. I talked to him about how best to expedite the exploration of natural gas in Mexico and transport it up to the United States so we become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil. This is a major problem facing America. The administration did not deal with it. It\u2019s time for a new administration to deal with the energy problem."}

I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and I\u2019m worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions. This is a very important topic and it\u2019s a very sensitive topic, because a lot of good people disagree on the issue. I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America. Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country. Life of the unborn. As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life. I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America. What I do believe is that we can find good, common ground on issues of parental consent or parental notification. I know we need to ban partial birth abortions. This is a place where my opponent and I have strong disagreement. I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America. This is an issue that will require a new attitude. We\u2019ve been battling over abortion for a long period of time. Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life. Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors to \u2014 to allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors. Surely we can work together to create a cultural life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbor\u2019s life with a gun will understand that that\u2019s not the way America is meant to be. Surely we can find common ground to reduce the number of abortions in America. As to the drug itself, I mentioned I was disappointed.

They determined it was medically safe for the women who use that drug. This is indeed a very important issue.

That\u2019s not the main issue. The main issue is whether or not the Roe v. Wade decision is going to be overturned. I support a woman\u2019s right to choose. My opponent does not. It is important because the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court. And Governor Bush has declared to the anti-choice groups that he will appoint justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who are known for being the most vigorous opponents of a woman\u2019s right to choose. Here is the difference. He trusts the government to order a woman to do what it thinks she ought to do. I trust women to make the decisions that affect their lives, their destinies and their bodies.

A lot of questions are first impression, and these questions that have been seen many times come up in a new context and so \u2014 but, you know, this is a very important issue.

His opponent, Kostunica, has won the election. It\u2019s overwhelming. Milosevic\u2019s government refuses to release the vote count. There\u2019s now a general strike going on. They\u2019re demonstrating. I think we should support the people of Serbia and Yugoslavia, as they call the Serbia plus Montenegro, and put pressure in every way possible to recognize the lawful outcome of the election. The people of Serbia have acted very bravely in kicking this guy out of office. Now he is trying to not release the votes and then go straight to a so-called runoff election without even announcing the results of the first vote. Now, we\u2019ve made it clear, along with our allies, that when Milosevic leaves, then Serbia will be able to have a more normal relationship with the rest of the world. That is a very strong incentive that we\u2019ve given them to do the right thing. Bear in mind also, Milosevic has been indicted as a war criminal and he should be held accountable for his actions. Now, we have to take measured steps because the sentiment within Serbia is, for understandable reasons, against the United States because their nationalism \u2014 even if they don\u2019t like Milosevic, they still have some feelings lingering from the NATO action there. So we have to be intelligent in the way we go about it. But make no mistake about it, we should do everything we can to see that the will of the Serbian people expressed in this extraordinary election is done. And I hope that he\u2019ll be out of office very shortly."}

As the vice president is. It\u2019s time for the man to go. It means that the United States must have a strong diplomatic hand with our friends in NATO. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to make sure our alliances are as strong as they possibly can be to keep the pressure on Mr. Milosevic. But this will be an interesting moment for the Russians to step up and lead as well. Be a wonderful time for the Russians to step into the Balkans and convince Mr. Milosevic that it\u2019s in his best interest and his country\u2019s best interest to leave office. The Russians have a lot of sway in that part of the world. We would like to see the Russians use that sway to encourage democracy to take hold. It\u2019s an encouraging election.

Bear in mind that we have a lot of sanctions in force against Serbia right now. And the people of Serbia know that they can escape all those sanctions if this guy is turned out of power. Now, I understand what the governor has said about asking the Russians to be involved, and under some circumstances that might be a good idea. But being as they have not yet been willing to recognize Kostunica as the lawful winner of the election, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s right for us to invite the president of Russia to mediate this \u2014 this dispute there because we might not like the results that comes out of that. They currently favor going forward with a runoff election. I think that\u2019s the wrong thing. I think the governor\u2019s instinct is not necessarily bad because we have worked with the Russians in a constructive way in Kosovo, for example, to end the conflict there. But I think we need to be very careful in the present situation before we invite the Russians to play the lead role in mediating."}

That would be a time to seriously consider the use of force. Secondly, whether or not the mission was clear. Whether or not it was a clear understanding as to what the mission would be. Thirdly, whether or not we were prepared and trained to win. Whether or not our forces were of high morale and high standing and well-equipped. And finally, whether or not there was an exit strategy. I would take the use of force very seriously. I would be guarded in my approach. I don\u2019t think we can be all things to all people in the world. I think we\u2019ve got to be very careful when we commit our troops. The vice president and I have a disagreement about the use of troops. He believes in nation building. I would be very careful about using our troops as nation builders. I believe the role of the military is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place. So I would take my responsibility seriously. And it starts with making sure we rebuild our military power. Morale in today\u2019s military is too low. We\u2019re having trouble meeting recruiting goals. We met the goals this year, but in the previous years we have not met recruiting goals. Some of our troops are not well-equipped. I believe we\u2019re overextended in too many places. And therefore I want to rebuild the military power. It starts with a billion dollar pay raise for the men and women who wear the uniform. A billion dollars more than the president recently signed into law. It\u2019s to make sure our troops are well-housed and well-equipped. Bonus plans to keep some of our high-skilled folks in the services and a commander in chief who clearly sets the mission. The mission is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place."}

First of all \u00c2 I want to make it clear, our military is the strongest, best-trained, best-equipped, best-led fighting force in the world and in the history of the world. Nobody should have any doubt about that, least of all our adversaries or potential adversaries. If you entrust me with the presidency, I will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure our forces stay the strongest in the world. In fact, in my ten-year budget proposal I\u2019ve set aside more than twice as much for this purpose as Governor Bush has in his proposal. Now, I think we should be reluctant to get involved in someplace in a foreign country. But if our national security is at stake, if we have allies, if we\u2019ve tried every other course, if we\u2019re sure military action will succeed, and if the costs are proportionate to the benefits, we should get involved. Now, just because we don\u2019t want to get involved everywhere doesn\u2019t mean we should back off anywhere it comes up. I disagree with the proposal that maybe only when oil supplies are at stake that our national security is at risk. I think that there are situations like in Bosnia or Kosovo where there\u2019s a genocide, where our national security is at stake there."}

A recent poll was taken among 1,000 enlisted personnel, as well as officers, over half of whom will leave the service when their time of enlistment is up. The captains are leaving the service. There is a problem. And it\u2019s going to require a new commander in chief to rebuild the military power. The other day I was honored to be flanked by Colin Powell and General Norman Schwartzkopf recently stood by me side and agreed with me. They said even if we are the strongest if we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do something if we don\u2019t have a clear vision of the military, if we don\u2019t stop extending our troops all around the world and nation building missions, then we\u2019re going to have a serious problem coming down the road, and I\u2019m going to prevent that. I\u2019m going to rebuild our military power. It\u2019s one of the major priorities of my administration."}

When I was a young man, I volunteered for the Army. I served my country in Vietnam. My father was a senator who strongly opposed the Vietnam War. I went to college in this great city, and most of my peers felt against the war as I did. But I went anyway because I knew if I didn\u2019t, somebody else in the small town of Carthage, Tennessee, would have to go in my place. I served for eight years in the House of Representatives and I served on the Intelligence Committee, specialized in looking at arms control. I served for eight years in the United States Senate and served on the Armed Services Committee. For the last eight years I\u2019ve served on the National Security Council, and when the conflict came up in Bosnia, I saw a genocide in the heart of Europe with the most violent war on the continent of Europe since World War II. Look, that\u2019s where World War I started in the Balkans. My uncle was a victim of poisonous gas there. Millions of Americans saw the results of that conflict. We have to be willing to make good, sound judgments. Incidentally, I know the value of making sure our troops have the latest technology. The governor has proposed skipping the next generation of weapons. I think that\u2019s a big mistake, because I think we have to stay at the cutting edge."}

Whether or not one makes decisions based on sound principles or whether or not you rely upon polls and focus groups on how to decide what the course of action is. We have too much polling and focus groups going on in Washington today. We need decisions made on sound principles. I\u2019ve been the governor of a big state. I think one of the hallmarks of my relationship in Austin, Texas, is that I\u2019ve had the capacity to work with both Republicans and Democrats. I think that\u2019s an important part of leadership. I think what it means to build consensus. I\u2019ve shown I know how to do so.

When I was in the United States Senate I worked with former President Bush, your father. I was one of only a few Democrats in the Senate to support the Persian Gulf War.

This is a very important moment in the history of our country. Look, we\u2019ve got the biggest surpluses in all of American history. The key question that has to be answered in this election is will we use that prosperity wisely in a way that benefits all of our people and doesn\u2019t go just to the few. Almost half of all the tax cut benefits, as I said under Governor Bush\u2019s plan, go to the wealthiest 1%. I think we have to make the right and responsible choices. I think we have to invest in education, protecting the environment, health care, a prescription drug benefit that goes to all seniors, not just to the poor, under Medicare, not relying on HMOs and insurance companies. I think that we have to help parents and strengthen families by dealing with the kind of inappropriate entertainment material that families are just heart sick that their children are exposed to. I think we\u2019ve got to have welfare reform taken to the next stage. I think that we have got to balance the budget every single year, pay down the national debt and, in fact, under my proposal the national debt will be completely eliminated by the year 2012. I think we need to put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox. The governor will not put Medicare in a lockbox. I don\u2019t think it should be used as a piggy bank for other programs. I think it needs to be moved out of the budget and protected. I\u2019ll veto anything that takes money out of Social Security or Medicare for anything other than Social Security or Medicare. Now, the priorities are just very different. I\u2019ll give you a couple of examples. For every new dollar that I propose for spending on health care, Governor Bush spends $3 for a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%. Now, for every dollar that I propose to spend on education, he spends $5 on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%. Those are very clear differences."}

There\u2019s differences. Under Vice President Gore\u2019s plan, he is going to grow the federal government in the largest increase since Lyndon Baines Johnson in 1965. We\u2019re talking about a massive government, folks. We\u2019re talking about adding to or increasing 200 programs, 20,000 new bureaucrats. Imagine how many IRS agents it is going to take to be able to figure out his targeted tax cut for the middle class that excludes 50 million Americans. There is a huge difference in this campaign. He says he\u2019s going to give you tax cuts. 50 million of you won\u2019t receive it. He said in his speech he wants to make sure the right people get tax relief. That\u2019s not the role of a president to decide right and wrong. Everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief. After my plan is in place, the wealthiest Americans will pay a higher percentage of taxes then they do today, the poorest of Americans, six million families, won\u2019t pay any tax at all. It\u2019s a huge difference. A difference between big exploding federal government that wants to think on your behalf and a plan that meets priorities and liberates working people to be able to make decisions on your own."}

Secondly, if you\u2019re a family of four making $50,000 in Massachusetts, you get a 50% tax cut. Let me give you one example. The Strunk family in Allentown, Pennsylvania, I campaigned with them the other day. They make $51,000 combined income, they pay about $3500 in taxes. Under my plan, they get $1800 of tax relief. Under Vice President Gore\u2019s plan, they get $145 of tax relief. Now you tell me who stands on the side of the fence. You ask the Strunks whose plan makes more sense. There is a difference of opinion. He would rather spend the family\u2019s $1800 and I would rather the Strunks spend their own money."}

And if you just add the numbers up, he still hasn\u2019t denied it, he spends more money on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1% than all his new proposals for prescription drugs, healthcare, education, and national defense combined. Now those are the wrong priorities. $665 billion over ten years for the wealthiest 1%. As I said, almost 30% of it goes to Americans that make more than $1 million per year. Every middle class family is eligible for a tax cut under my proposal. Let me give you some specific examples. I believe college tuition up to $10,000 per year ought to be tax deductible so middle-class families can choose to send their children to college. I believe all senior citizens should be able to choose their own doctors and get prescription drugs from their own pharmacists with Medicare paying half the bill. I believe parents ought to be able to make more choices need more public and charter school choice to send their kids always to a safe school. We need to make education the number one priority in our country and treat teachers like the professionals that they are. And that\u2019s why I have made it a number one priority in my budget, not a tax cut for the wealthy."}

If you\u2019re a single mother making $22,000 a year and you have two children, under this tax code, for every additional dollar you make, you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making more than $200,000 a year, and that is not right. My plan drops the rate from 15% to 10% and increases the child credit from $500 to $1,000 to make the code more fair for everybody, not just a few, not just a handful.

Let me give you a story about public education, if I might. It\u2019s about Kipp Academy in Houston, Texas. A charter school run by some people from Teach For America. Young folks saying I\u2019m going to do something good for my country. I want to teach. A guy named Michael runs the school. It is a school full of so-called at-risk children. It\u2019s how we unfortunately label certain children. Basically it means they can\u2019t learn. It\u2019s a school of strong discipline and high standards. It\u2019s one of the best schools in Houston. Here are the key ingredients. High expectations, strong accountabily. What Michael says, don\u2019t put all these rules on us, just let us teach and hold us accountable for every grade. That\u2019s what we do. And as a result, these mainly Hispanic youngsters are some of the best learners in Houston, Texas. That\u2019s my vision for public education all around America. Many of you viewers don\u2019t know, but Laura and I sent our girls to public school. They went to Austin High School. And many of the public schools are meeting the call. But, unfortunately, a lot of schools are trapping children in schools that just won\u2019t teach and won\u2019t change. Here is the role of the federal government. One is to change Head Start to a reading program. Two is to say if you want to access reading money, you can do so. The goal is for every single child to learn to Read. there must by K-2 diagnostic teaching tools, teacher training money, available. Three, we have to consolidate the federal programs to free districts to free the schools and encourage innovators like Michael. Let them reach out beyond the confines of the current structure to recruit teach-for-the-children type teachers. Four, we\u2019re going to say if you receive federal money, measure third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grade. Show us if they are learning to read, write, add and subtract and if so there will be bonus plans. But if not, instead of continuing to subsidize failure, the money will go to \u2014 the federal money will go to the parents for public school or charter school or tutorial or Catholic school. What I care about is children. And so does Michael Feinberg. And you know what? It can happen in America with the right kind of leadership."}

Every school and every school district, have every state test the children. I\u2019ve also proposed a voluntary national test in the fourth grade and eighth grade, and a form of testing the governor has not endorsed. I think that all new teachers ought to be tested in the subjects that they teach. We\u2019ve got to recruit 100,000 new teachers. And I have budgeted for that. We\u2019ve got to reduce the class size so that the student who walks in has more one-on-one time with the teacher. We ought to have universal pre-school and we ought to make college tuition tax deductible, up to $10,000 a year. I would like to tell you a quick story. I got a letter today as I left Sarasota, Florida. I\u2019m here with a group of 13 people from around the country who helped me prepare. We had a great time. Two days ago we ate lunch at a restaurant. The guy that served us lunch gave me a letter today. His name is Randy Ellis. He has a 15-year-old daughter named Caley, who is in Sarasota High School. Her science class was supposed to be for 24 students. She\u2019s the 36th student in that classroom. They sent me a picture of her in the classroom. They can\u2019t squeeze another desk in for her, so she has to stand during class.

You must say that if you receive money you must show us whether or not children are learning to read and write and add and subtract. That\u2019s the difference. You may claim you\u2019ve got mandatory testing but you don\u2019t, Mr. Vice President. That\u2019s a huge difference. Testing is the cornerstone of reform. You know how I know? Because it\u2019s the cornerstone of reform in the State of Texas. Republicans and Democrats came together and said what can we do to make our public education the best in the country? We\u2019ve done a long way working together to do so. The cornerstone is to have strong accountability in return for money and in return for flexibility. We\u2019re going to ask you to show us whether or not \u2014 we ask you to post the results on the Internet. We encourage parents to take a look at the comparative results of schools. We have a strong charter school movement that I signed the legislation to get started in the State of Texas. I believe if we find poor children trapped in schools that won\u2019t teach, we need to free the parents. We need to expand education savings accounts.

I think the governor may not have heard what I said clearly. The voluntary national testing is in addition to the mandatory testing that we require of states. All schools, all school districts, students themselves, and required teacher testing, which goes a step farther than Governor Bush has been willing to go. Here are a couple of differences, though, Jim. Governor Bush is in favor of vouchers which take taxpayer money away from public schools and give them to private schools that are not accountable for how the money is used and don\u2019t have to take all applicants. Now, private schools play a great role in our society. All of our children have gone to both public schools and private schools. But I don\u2019t think private schools should have a right to take taxpayer money away from public schools at a time when Caley Ellis is standing in that classroom. Let me give you another example. I went to a school in Dade County, Florida where the facilities are so overcrowded the children have to eat lunch in shifts with the first shift for lunch starting at 9:30 in the morning. Look, this is a funding crisis all around the country. There are fewer parents of school-age children as a percentage of the voting population and there is the largest generation of students ever. We\u2019re in an information age when learning is more important than ever. 90% of our kids go to public schools. We have to make it the number one priority. Modernize our schools, reduce class size, recruit new teachers, give every child a chance to learn with one-on-one time in a quality \u2014 high-quality, safe school. If it\u2019s a failing school, shut it down and reopen it under a new principal with a turnaround team of specialists the way Governor Jim Hunt does in North Carolina. Here is another difference. The governor, if it\u2019s a failing school, would leave the children in that failing school for three years and then give a little bit of money to the parents, a down payment on a down payment for private school tuition, and pretend that that would be enough for them to go out and go to a private school. It\u2019s an illusion."}

But it was a calculated risk that paid off. Now, I could probably give you some other examples of decisions over the last 24 years. I have been in public service for 24 years, Jim. And throughout all that time the people I have fought for have been the middle-class families, and I have been willing to stand up to powerful interests like the big insurance companies, the drug companies, the HMOs, the oil companies. They have good people and they play constructive roles sometimes, but sometimes they get too much power. I cast my lot with the people even when it means that you have to stand up to some powerful interests who are trying to turn the \u2014 the policies and the laws to their advantage. You can see it in this campaign. The big drug companies support Governor Bush\u2019s prescription drug proposal.

We end up being problem solvers. We come up with practical, common sense solutions for problems that we\u2019re confronted with.

I have had a chance to work with him and Alan Greenspan and others on the crisis following the collapse of the Mexican peso. When the Asian financial crisis raised the risk of world-wide recession that could affect our economy, And now, of course, the euro\u2019s value has been dropping, but seems to be under control. But it started for me in the last eight years when I had the honor of casting the tie-breaking vote to end the old economic plan here at home and put into place a new economic plan that has helped us to make some progress, 22 million new jobs, the greatest prosperity ever.

It\u2019s their ingenuity, I agree with that. But you know, they were working pretty hard eight years ago. And now they had ingenuity eight years ago. The difference is we\u2019ve got a new policy. And instead of concentrating on tax cuts mostly for the wealthy, we want \u2014 I want tax cuts for the middle-class families and I want to continue the prosperity and make sure that it enriches not just a few but all of our families. We have gone from the biggest deficits to the biggest surpluses. We have gone from a triple-dip recession during the previous 12 years to a tripling of the stock market. Instead of a high unemployment, we have the lowest African-American and Latin American unemployment rates in history and 22 million new jobs. It\u2019s not good enough. Too many people have been left behind. We have got to do much more. The key is job training, education, investments in health care and education, environment, retirement security. And incidentally, we have got to preserve Social Security. I\u2019m totally opposed to diverting one out of every six dollars out of the Social Security trust fund, as the Governor has proposed, into the stock market. I want new incentives for savings and investment for the young couples who are working hard so they can save and invest on their own on top of Social Security, not at the expense of Social Security, as the governor proposes."}
{"Title":"October 3, 2000 Transcript","Debate":"The First Gore-Bush Presidential Debate","Date":970531200000,"Participants":"Gore-Bush","Moderators":"MODERATOR","Speaker":"BUSH","Text":"Two points. One, a lot of folks are still waiting for that 1992 middle-class tax cut. I remember the vice president saying, \u201cJust give us a chance to get up there, we\u2019re going to make sure you get tax cuts.\u201d It didn\u2019t happen. Now he\u2019s having to say that again. They\u2019ve had their chance to deliver a tax cut to you. Secondly, the surest way to bust this economy is to increase the role and size of the federal budget. The Senate Budget Committee did a study of the vice president\u2019s expenditures. It\u2019s been projected that they could conceivably bust the budget by $900 billion. That means he\u2019ll either have to raise your taxes by $900 billion or go into the Social Security surplus for $900 billion. This is a plan that is going to increase the bureaucracy by 20,000 people. His targeted tax cut is so detailed, so much fine print that it is going to require numerous IRS agents. We need somebody to simplify the code, to be fair, to continue prosperity by sharing some of the surplus with the people who pay the bills, particularly those at the bottom end of the economic ladder."}
{"Title":"October 3, 2000 Transcript","Debate":"The First Gore-Bush Presidential Debate","Date":970531200000,"Participants":"Gore-Bush","Moderators":"MODERATOR","Speaker":"GORE","Text":"If I could respond, Jim.

Now, as for 20,000 new bureaucrats, as you call them, you know, the size of the federal government will go down in a Gore administration. In the reinventing government program you just look at the numbers. It is 300,000 people smaller today than it was eight years ago. Now, the fact is you\u2019re going to have a hard time convincing folks that we were a whole lot better off eight years ago than we are today. But that\u2019s not the question. The question is, will we be better off four years from now than we are today? And as for the surest way to threaten our prosperity, having a $1.9 trillion tax cut, almost half of which goes to the wealthy, and a $1 trillion Social Security privatization proposal is the surest way to put our budget into deficit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c raise interest rates and put our prosperity at risk."}

I\u2019m not going to be a picker and chooser. What is fair is everybody who pays taxes ought to get relief."}
{"Title":"October 3, 2000 Transcript","Debate":"The First Gore-Bush Presidential Debate","Date":970531200000,"Participants":"Gore-Bush","Moderators":"MODERATOR","Speaker":"GORE","Text":"I do disagree. Because if we can keep our prosperity going, if we can continue balancing the budget and paying down the debt, then the strong economy keeps generating surpluses. Here is my plan. I will keep Social Security in a lockbox and that pays down the national debt. And the interest savings I would put right back into Social Security. That extends the life of Social Security for 55 years. Now, I think that it\u2019s very important to understand that cutting benefits under Social Security means that people like Winifred Skinner from Des Moines, Iowa, who is here, would really have a much harder time. Because there are millions of seniors who are living almost hand to mouth. And you talk about cutting benefits. I don\u2019t go along with it. I am opposed to it. I\u2019m also opposed to a plan that diverts 1 out of every $6 away from the Social Security Trust Fund. Social Security is a trust fund that pays the checks this year with the money that is paid into Social Security this year. The governor wants to divert 1 out of every $6 off into the stock market, which means that he would drain a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund in this generation over the next ten years, and Social Security under that approach would go bankrupt within this generation. His leading advisor on this plan actually said that would be okay, because then the Social Security Trust Fund could start borrowing. It would borrow up to $3 trillion. Now, Social Security has never done that. And I don\u2019t think it should do that. I think it should stay in a lockbox, and I\u2019ll tell you this. I will veto anything that takes money out of Social Security for privatization or anything else other than Social Security."}

He puts no real assets into the Social Security system. The revenues exceed the expenses in Social Security until the year 2015 which means all retirees are going to get the promises made. For those of you who he wants to scare into the voting booth to vote for him, hear me loud and clear. A promise made will be a promise kept. You bet we want to allow younger workers to take some of their own money. That\u2019s the difference of opinion. The vice president thinks it\u2019s the government\u2019s money. The payroll taxes are your money. You ought to put it in prudent, safe investments so that $1 trillion over the next ten years grows to be $3 trillion. The money stays within the Social Security system. It\u2019s a part of the Social Security system. He claims it will be out of Social Security. It\u2019s your money, it\u2019s a part of your retirement benefit. It\u2019s a fundamental difference between what we believe. I want you to have your own asset that you can call your own. That you can pass on from one generation to the next. I want to get a better rate of return for your own money than the paltry 2% that the current Social Security Trust gets today. Mr. Greenspan I thought missed an opportunity to say there\u2019s a third way, and that is to get a better rate of return on the Social Security monies coming into the trust. There is $2.3 trillion of surplus that we can use to make sure that younger workers have a Social Security plan in the future. If we\u2019re smart and if we trust workers and if we understand the power of the compounding rate of interest."}

I give a new incentive for younger workers to save their own money and invest their own money, but not at the expense of Social Security, on top of Social Security. My plan is Social Security plus. The governor\u2019s plan is Social Security minus. Your future benefits would be cut by the amount that\u2019s diverted into the stock market. If you make bad investments, that\u2019s too bad. But even before then the problem hits because the money contributed to Social Security this year is an entitlement. That\u2019s how it works. And the money is used to pay the benefits for seniors this year. If you cut the amount going in 1 out of every $6, then you have to cut the value of each check by 1 out of every $6 unless you come up with the money from somewhere else. I would like to know from the governor \u2014 I know we\u2019re not supposed to ask each other questions \u2014 but I\u2019d be interested in knowing, does that trillion dollars come from the trust fund, or does it come from the rest of the budget?"}

That is what it is. You leave future generations with tremendous IOUs. It\u2019s time to have a leader that doesn\u2019t put off tomorrow what we should do today. It\u2019s time to have somebody to step up and say look, let\u2019s let younger workers take some of their own money and under certain guidelines invest it in the private markets. The safest of federal investments yields 4%. That\u2019s twice the amount of rate of return than the current Social Security Trust. It\u2019s a fundamental difference of opinion here, folks. Younger worker after younger worker hears my call that says I trust you. And you know what, the issue is changing. Seniors now understand that the promise made will be a promise kept, but younger workers now understand we better have a government that trusts them and that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do."}

And anybody who thinks I\u2019m just saying it, it will be the first bill I send to the Congress. I want you to know I care passionately about this and I will fight until it becomes law."}

Mine is I want to empower people in their own lives. I also want to go to Washington to get some positive things done. It is going to require a new spirit. A spirit of cooperation. It will require the ability of a Republican president to reach out across the partisan divide and to say to Democrats, let\u2019s come together to do what is right for America. It\u2019s been my record as Governor of Texas, it will be how I conduct myself if I\u2019m fortunate enough to earn your vote as President of the United States. I want to finally get something done on Medicare. I want to make sure prescription drugs are available for all seniors. And I want seniors to have additional choices when it comes to choosing their health care plans. I want to finally get something done on Social Security. I want to make sure the seniors have the promise made will be a promise kept, but I want younger workers to be able to manage some of their own money, some of their own payroll taxes in the private sector under certain guidelines to get a better rate of return on your own money. I want to rebuild our military to keep the peace. I want to have a strong hand when it comes to the United States in world affairs. I don\u2019t want to try to put our troops in all places at all times. I don\u2019t want to be the world\u2019s policeman, I want to be the world\u2019s peacemaker by having a military of high morale and a military that is well-equipped. I want anti-ballistic missile systems to protect ourselves and our allies from a rogue nation that may try to hold us hostage or blackmail our allies and friends. I want to make sure the education system fulfills its hope and promise. I\u2019ve had a strong record of working with Democrats and Republicans in Texas to make sure no child is left behind. I understand the limited role of the federal government, but it could be a constructive role when it comes to reform, by insisting that there be a strong accountability systems. My intentions are to earn your vote and earn your confidence. I\u2019m asking for your vote. I want you to be on my team. And for those of you working, thanks from the bottom of my heart. For those of you making up your mind, I would be honored to have your support."}

We\u2019re at a fork in the road. We have this incredible prosperity, but a lot of people have been left behind. And we have a very important decision to make. Will we use the prosperity to enrich all of our families and not just a few? One important way of looking at this is to ask who are you going to fight for? Throughout my career in public service, I have fought for the working men and women of this country, middle-class families. Why? Because you are the ones who have the hardest time paying taxes, the hardest time making ends meet. You are the ones who are making car payments and mortgage payments and doing right by your kids. And a lot of times there are powerful forces that are against you. Make no mistake about it, they do have undue influence in Washington, D.C. and it makes a difference if you have a president who will fight for you. I know one thing about the position of president, it\u2019s the only position in our Constitution that is filled by an individual who is given the responsibility to fight not just for one state or one district or the well-connected or wealthy, but to fight for all of the people, including especially those who most need somebody who will stand up and take on whatever powerful forces might stand in the way. There is a woman named Winifred Skinner here tonight from Iowa. I mentioned her earlier. She\u2019s 79 years old. She has Social Security. I\u2019m not going to cut her benefits or support any proposal that would. She gets a small pension, but in order to pay for her prescription drug benefits, she has to go out seven days a week several hours a day picking up cans. She came all the way from Iowa in a Winnebago with her poodle in order attend here tonight. I want to tell her, I\u2019ll fight for a prescription drug benefit for all seniors and fight for the people of this country for a prosperity that benefits all."}

I think this is an extraordinarily important decision we\u2019ll make on November 7th. We\u2019re really going to choose between what I consider to be an old way of governing ourselves of high levels of spending, high taxes, ever more intrusive bureaucracy or a new course, a new era, if you will. And Governor Bush and I want to offer that new course of action. With respect to the surplus, Bernie, we have to make some kind of forecast. We can\u2019t make 12-month decisions in this business. We\u2019re talking about the kinds of fundamental changes in programs and government that are going to affect people\u2019s lives for the next 25 or 30 years. And while it may be a little risky in some respects from an economic standpoint to try to forecast surpluses, I think we have to make some planning assumption to proceed. We care a great deal about the issues at stake here. One of the difficulties we have, frankly, for the last eight years we ignored a lot of these problems. We haven\u2019t moved aggressively on Social Security, on Medicare. There are important issues out there that need to be resolved. It\u2019s important for us to get on with that business. That\u2019s what Governor Bush and I want to do."}

Our desire is to find ways to reform our educational system, to return it to its former glory. I\u2019m a product of public schools, my family, wife and daughters all went to public schools. We believe very much in the public school system. But if you look at where we are from the standpoint of the nation, recent exams. For example, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, an independent testing service, shows there\u2019s been no progress on reading scores in the last eight years. Almost no progress on math. The achievement gap between minority and non-minority students is as big as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever been. We\u2019ve had a significant increase in spending for education nationwide, but it has produced almost no positive results. That\u2019s unacceptable from our standpoint. If you look at it and think about it, we now have in our most disadvantaged communities, 70% of our fourth graders can\u2019t read at the basic level of understanding. We\u2019ve graduated 15 million kids from high school in the last few years who can\u2019t read at a significant level. They are permanently sentenced to a lifetime of failure. What we want to do is to change that. We think we know how to do it. Governor Bush has done it in Texas. We want to emphasize local control so that people here in Danville, KY decide what is best for their kids. We want to insist on high standards. One of the worst things we can do is fail to establish high standards, in effect to say to a youngster because of their ethnic background or income level, we don\u2019t have the same kind of expectations from you that we have from everybody else. We want accountability. We have to test every child every year to know whether or not we\u2019re making progress with respect to achieving those goals and objectives. We think it\u2019s extraordinarily important. Probably the single most important issue in this campaign. Governor Bush has made it clear that when he\u2019s elected this will be his number one priority as a legislative measure to submit to the Congress."}

If you look at our proposal, we take half of the projected surplus and set it aside for Social Security. Over $2.4 trillion. We take roughly a fourth of it for other urgent priorities such as Medicare reform and education, several of these other key programs we want to support. And we take roughly one-fourth of it and return it in the form of a tax cut to the American taxpayer. We think it\u2019s extraordinarily important to do that. It is a fundamental difference between our two approaches. If you look, frankly, by our numbers and the numbers of the Senate Budget Committee, which has totaled up all the promises that Vice President Gore has made during the course of the campaign, they are some $900 billion in spending over and above that surplus already and we still have a month to go in the campaign. The fact is that the program that we put together we think is very responsible. Suggestion that somehow all of it is going for tax cuts isn\u2019t true. Another way to look at it is over the course of the next ten years we\u2019ll collect roughly $25 trillion in revenue. We want to take about 5% of that and return that to the American taxpayer in the form of tax relief. We have the highest level of taxation now we\u2019ve had since World War II. The average American family is paying about 40% in federal, state and local taxes. We think it is appropriate to return to the American people so that they can make choices themselves in how that money ought to be spent; whether on education, retirement or on paying their bills. It is their choice and it is their prerogative. We want to give them the opportunity to make those kinds of choices for themselves and we think this is a totally reasonable approach."}

We have made progress in recent years, but I think we have a ways to go. It\u2019s not just about the differential with respect to women. If you look at our opponent\u2019s tax proposal, they discriminate between stay-at-home moms with children that they take care of themselves and those who go to work or who, in fact, have their kids taken care of outside the home. You, in effect, as a stay-at-home mom get no tax advantage under the Gore tax plan as contrasted with the Bush proposal. It provides tax relief for absolutely everybody who pays taxes. It\u2019s important to understand the things we\u2019re trying to change and address in the course of the campaign and what our agenda is for the future, our plans are for the future, focus very much about giving as much control as we can to individual Americans, be they men or women, be they single or married, as much control as possible over their own lives, especially in the area of taxation. We want to make certain that the American people have the ability to keep more of what they earn and then they can get to decide how to spend it. The proposal we have from Al Gore, basically, doesn\u2019t do that. It in effect lays out some 29 separate tax credits. If you live your life the way they want you to live your life, if you behave in a certain way, you qualify for a tax credit and at that point you get some relief. Bottom line, though, is 50 million American taxpayers out there get no advantages at all out of the Gore tax proposal, whereas under the Bush plan everybody who pays taxes will get tax relief."}

Governor Bush and I have emphasized while, while we are clearly both pro-life, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we believe. We want to reduce the incidence of abortion on our society. Many on the pro-choice side have said the same thing. Even Bill Clinton has advocated reducing abortion to make it as rare as possible. With respect to the question of RU-486, we believe that \u2014 of course, that it\u2019s recently been approved by the FDA. That really was a question of whether or not it was safe to be used by women. They didn\u2019t address the sort of the question of whether or not there should or should not be abortion in the society so much as evaluate that particular drug. What we would like to be able to do is to look for ways to reach across the divide between the two points of view and find things that we can do together to reduce the incidence of abortion. Such things as promoting adoption as an alternative. Encouraging parental notification. And we also think banning the horrific practice of partial birth abortions is an area where there could be agreement. Congress has twice passed by overwhelming margins, a significant number of votes from both parties, the ban on partial birth abortions. Twice it\u2019s been vetoed by Bill Clinton and Al Gore. We would hope eventually they would recognize that\u2019s not a good position for them to be in. With respect to the RU-486 proposal, at this stage I haven\u2019t looked in particular at that particular piece of legislation. Governor Bush made it clear the other night he did not anticipate that he would be able to go in and direct the FDA to reverse course on that particular issue, primarily because the decision they made was on the drug, not the question of whether or not it would support abortion."}

I hope it marks the end of Milosevic. I think probably more than anything else it\u2019s a victory for the Serbian people. They\u2019ve taken to the streets to support their democracy, to support their vote. In some respects this is a continuation of a process that began ten years ago all across eastern Europe and has only now arrived in Serbia. We saw it in Germany, we saw it in Rumania, we saw it in Czechoslovakia, as the people of eastern Europe rose up and made their claim for freedom. And I think we all admire that. I think with respect to how this process has been managed most recently, we want to do everything we can to support Mr. Milosevic\u2019s departure. Certainly, though, that would not involve committing U.S. troops. I do think it\u2019s noteworthy that there appears to be an effort underway to get the Russians involved. I noted the other night, for example, Tuesday night at the debate in Boston, Governor Bush suggested exactly that we ought to try to get the Russians involved to exercise some leverage over the Serbians. It\u2019s now clear from the press that, in fact, that\u2019s exactly what they were doing. It\u2019s \u2014 Governor Bush was correct in his assessment and his recommendation. He has supported the administration on Kosovo. He lobbied actively against passage of the Byrd-Warner provision which would have set a specific deadline, one he felt was too soon, for forcing the U.S. troops out. He\u2019s been supportive of the policy that we\u2019ve seen with respect to Yugoslavia. And I think he deserves a lot of credit for that. I would go beyond that. I think this is an opportunity for the United States to test President Putin of Russia. That in fact now is the time we ought to find out whether he\u2019s committed to democracy. Whether or not he\u2019s willing to support the forces of freedom and democracy diplomatically there in the area of eastern Europe. And it\u2019s a test for him whether he represents the old guard in the Soviet Union. One of the most important challenges we face as a nation is how we manage that process of integrating those 150 million eastern Europeans into the security and economic framework of Europe."}

There may be occasion when it\u2019s appropriate to use them in a peacekeeping role, but I think the role ought to be limited, there ought to be a time limit on it. The reason we have a military is to be able to fight and win wars. And to maintain with sufficient strength so that would-be adversaries are deterred from ever launching a war in the first place. I think that the administration has, in fact, in this area failed in a major responsibility. We\u2019ve seen a reduction in our forces far beyond anything that was justified by the end of the Cold War. At the same time we\u2019ve seen a rapid expansion of our commitments around the world as troops have been sent hither and yon. There was testimony before the Joint Chiefs of Staff before the Armed Services Committee that pointed out a lot of these problems. For example General Mike Ryan of the Air Force with 40% fewer aircraft, he\u2019s now undertaking three times as many deployments on a regular basis as he had to previously. We\u2019re overcommitted and underresourced. This has had some other unfortunate effects. I saw a letter the other day from a young captain stationed in Fort Bragg, a graduate of West Point in \u201995 getting ready to get out of the service because he\u2019s only allowed to train with his troops when fuel is available for the vehicles and only allowed to fire their weapons twice a year. He\u2019s concerned that if he had to send them into combat it would mean lives lost. That is a legitimate concern, this is a very important area. The fact that the U.S. military is worse off today than it was eight years ago. Major responsibility for us in the future, a high priority for myself and Governor Bush to rebuild the U.S. military and to give them the resources they need to do the job we ask them to do for us and give them good leadership."}

I would like a chance to elaborate further, if I might. The facts are dramatically different. I\u2019m not attacking the military, Joe. I have enormous regard for the men and women of the U.S. military. I had the privilege of working with them for the four years I was the Secretary of Defense. No one has a higher regard than I do for them. It\u2019s irresponsible to suggest we shouldn\u2019t have this debate, that we should ignore what is a major, major concern. If you have friends and relatives serving in the U.S. military, you know there\u2019s a problem. If you look at the data that\u2019s available, 40% of our Army helicopters are not combat ready. The combat readiness level in the Air Force dropped from 85% to 65%. Significant problems of retention. The important thing for us to remember is that we\u2019re a democracy and we\u2019re defended by volunteers. Everybody out there tonight wearing the uniform, standing on guard to protect the United States is there because they volunteered to put on a uniform. When we don\u2019t give them the spare parts they need, when we don\u2019t give our pilots the flying hours they need to maintain their proficiency, when we don\u2019t give them the kind of leadership that spells out what their mission is and let\u2019s them know why they\u2019re putting their lives at risk, then we undermine that morale. That\u2019s an extraordinarily valuable trust. There is no more important responsibility for a President of the United States than his role as Commander in Chief, and the obligation he undertakes on behalf o fall of us when he decides when to send our young men and women to war. When we send them without the right kind of training, when we send them poorly equipped or with equipment that\u2019s old and broken down, we put their lives at risk. We will suffer more casualties in the next conflict if we don\u2019t look to those basic fundamental problems now. With all due respect this administration has a bad track record in this regard, and it\u2019s available for anybody who wants to look at the record and wants to talk to our men and women in uniform, and wants to spend time with the members of the Joint Chiefs, wants to look at readiness levels and other \u2014 other indicators. Final point, the issue of procurement is very important because we\u2019re running now off the buildup of the investment we made during the Reagan years. As that equipment gets old, it has to be replaced. We\u2019ve taken money out of the procurement budget to support other ventures. We have not been investing in the future of the U.S. military."}

Numerous administrations going back certainly to World War II have had to wrestle with the problem of what should happen to the Middle East. We made significant breakthroughs, I think, at the end of the Bush administration because of the Gulf War. In effect, we had joined together with Arab allies and done enormous damage to the Iraqi armed forces. Iraq was the biggest military threat to Israel. By virtue of the end of the Cold War, the Soviets were no longer a factor. They used to fish in troubled waters whenever they had the opportunity in the Middle East. With the end of the Soviet Union, the implosion of the empire, that created a vacuum if you will, and made it easier for us to operate there. We were able to, I think, reassure both Arabs and Israelis would play a major role there. We have the ability and the will to deploy forces if we had to, to engage in military operations to help our friends and oppose our foes. We were able to convene them in a conference. The first time Arab and Israelis sat down face-to-face and began this process of trying to move the peace process forward. I think also a lot of credit goes to some great men like Yitzak Rabin. His tragic passing was of great consequence, a great tragedy for everybody who cares about peace in the Middle East. He was a man who had the military stature to be able to confidently persuade the Israelis to take risks for peace. I think Barak has tried to same thing. I hope that we can get this resolved as soon as possible. My guess is the next administration is going to be the one that is going to have to come to grips with the current state of affairs there. I think it\u2019s very important that we have an administration where we have a president with firm leadership who has the kind of track record of dealing straight with people, of keeping his word so friends and allies both respect us and our adversaries fear us."}

We\u2019ll have to see if that happens. The thing about Iraq, of course, was at the end of the war we had pretty well decimated their military. We had put them back in the box, so to speak. We had a strong international coalition raid against them, effective economic sanctions, and a very robust inspection regime was in place under the U.N. auspices and it was able to do a good job of stripping out the capacity to build weapons of mass destruction, the work he had been doing that had not been destroyed during the war in biological and chemical agents, as well as a nuclear program. Unfortunately now we find ourselves in a situation where that started to fray on us, where the coalition now no longer is tied tightly together. Recently the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, two Gulf States, have reopened diplomatic relations with Baghdad. The Russians and French are flying commercial airliners back into Baghdad and thumbing their nose at the international sanctions regime, and of course U.N. inspectors have been kicked out and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been absolutely no response. . We\u2019re in a situation today where our posture with Iraq is weaker than it was at the end of the war. It\u2019s unfortunate. I also think it\u2019s unfortunate we find ourselves in a position where we don\u2019t know for sure what might be transpiring inside Iraq. I certainly hope he\u2019s not regenerating that kind of capability, but if he were, if in fact Saddam Hussein were taking steps to try to rebuild nuclear capability or weapons of mass destruction, you would have to give very serious consideration to military action to \u2014 to stop that activity. I don\u2019t think you can afford to have a man like Saddam Hussein with nuclear weapons in the Middle East."}

My assessment is that there is no comprehensive energy policy today. That as a nation, we are in trouble because the administration has not addressed these issues. We have the prospects of brownouts in California. We have a potential home heating oil crisis in the northeast. We have gasoline price rises in various other places. For years now the administration has talked about reducing our dependence on foreign sources of oil, but they haven\u2019t done it. In fact, we\u2019ve gone exactly in the opposite direction. We have the lowest rate of domestic production of oil now in 46 years. You have to go back to 1954 to find a time when we produced as little oil as we do today. Our imports are at an all-time record high. In June we imported almost 12 million barrels of oil a day. That means we are more subject to the wide fluctuations and swings in price. We have other problems. We don\u2019t have refinery capacity. We haven\u2019t built a new refinery in this country for over ten years. They\u2019re operating at 96% or 97% capacity. Even with more crude available they\u2019re probably not going to be able to do very much by way of producing additional home heating oil for this winter. We have a growing problem with our growing dependence on foreign sources of energy. That will allways be the case but we ought to be able to shift the trend and begin to move it in the right direction. We need to do a lot more about generating the capacity for power here at home. We need to get on with the business and we think we can do it very safely in an environmentally sound manner. We don\u2019t think we ought to buy into this false choice that somehow we cannot develop energy resources without being cautious with the environment. We can. We have the technology to do it and we ought to do it. We do support the low income energy assistance program. We think it\u2019s important that senior citizens don\u2019t suffer this winter, but we need to get on to the business of having a plan to develop our domestic energy resources in producing more supplies, and this administration hasn\u2019t produced them."}

We set aside a part of Wyoming, nearly a million acres of wilderness that ought to be separate and not be developed. We think that was important. There are a lot of areas around the country where Governor Bush and I support restraint. For example we support the moratorium on drilling off the coast of California, but there are places where we think we ought to go forward and develop those resources. The Arctic National Wildlife Reserve is one of them. It\u2019s on the north slope right next to Prudhoe Bay. The infrastructure is there to be able to deliver that product to market. We think we can do it given today\u2019s technology in a way that will not damage the environment, will not permanently marr the countryside at all, and so what we\u2019re looking for with respect to environmental policy and energy policy is balance. We do have to make choices, we recognize that. The way you phrased the question, frankly I welcome because it shows, in fact, we are trying to pursue a balanced approach and the suggestion that somehow all we care about is energy development isn\u2019t true. But we do have to get on with developing those resources or we\u2019re going to find ourselves ever more dependent on foreign sources. We\u2019re going to find that the fact that we don\u2019t have an energy policy out there is one of the major storm clouds on the horizon for our economy. I think if you look for something that could develop, some problem that could arise, that might, in fact, jeopardize our continuing prosperity, it\u2019s the possibility that we might find ourselves without adequate supplies of energy in the future. And there would be no quicker way to shut down our economy than that."}

The Social Security system is in trouble. It\u2019s been a fantastic program and has been there for 65 years that has provided benefits for senior citizens over that period of time. For my parents. It means a great deal to millions of Americans. And Governor Bush and I want to make absolutely certain that the first thing we do is guarantee the continuation of those payments, those benefits and keep those promises that were made. But if you look down the road, you say you\u2019re 30 years old today, and I have two daughters about that age. They seriously question whether or not there will be any system left for them. That\u2019s because the demographics that work out there, it\u2019s almost an iron law. They know how many people there are, when they reach retirement, we know when the baby boom generation is coming along, how long they will live after that, it will drive the system into bankruptcy unless we reform and deal with it. The reform we would like to offer is to allow our young people to begin to take a portion of the payroll tax, 2% of it, and invest it in a personal retirement account. That does several things. First of all, it gives them a stake in the Social Security system. That becomes their property. They own it. They can pass it on to their kids if they want. They don\u2019t have that kind of equity in Social Security today. Secondly, we can generate a higher return off that investment than you get in the existing system. Today you get about a 2% return of what you pay into Social Security. We think we can generate at least 6%. At least three times what we\u2019re able to get now. And long-term by generating a bigger return, we\u2019ll put additional funds into the system that will help us survive that crunch that is otherwise going to hit in the future. Bottom line is there\u2019s a choice here. With respect to Al Gore and Joe\u2019s plan, they don\u2019t reform Social Security. They add another huge obligation on top of it that future generations will have to pay. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t touch the basic system itself. They don\u2019t reform it and don\u2019t save it. We have a plan to do that and a plan to give our young people a choice and more control over their own lives."}

First of all, I agree with your assessment. I\u2019ve been out of Washington for the last eight years and spent the last five years running a company global concern. And been out in the private sector building a business, hiring people, creating jobs. I have a different perspective on Washington than I had when I was there in the past. I\u2019m proud of my service for 25 years, but also proud I had the opportunity to go out and get a different experience. And you\u2019re absolutely right. People are fed up. They\u2019ve had enough with the bickering and the partisanship that seems to characterize the debate that goes on in the nation\u2019s capital. I\u2019ve seen it done differently though. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen it in Texas. I\u2019ve watched George Bush. And one of the reasons I was eager to sign on when he asked me to become his running mate is because I\u2019ve been so tremendously impressed with what he\u2019s done as the Governor of Texas. He came in when he had a legislature completely controlled by the other party. He managed to reach across partisan lines and unite republicans, and democrats and independents and put them to work to achieve good things for the State of Texas. Partly because he didn\u2019t point the finger of blame looking for scapegoats he was quick to share the credit. He ended up, as a result of that activity of his first term, having the top Democrat in the state, Bob Bulloch, endorse George Bush for reelection. It\u2019s possible to change the tone. It is possible to get people to work together and to begin to focus on achieving results. I think it will take new leadership. I don\u2019t think you can do it, with all due respect to Al Gore, with somebody who spent all the last 24 years in that Washington environment and who campaigns on the basis of castigating others, pointing the finger of blame at others in terms of blaming business or various groups for failings. I think you have to be able to reach out and work together and build coalitions. I think George W. Bush has done it in Texas and can do it at the national level."}

Social Security problem\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been addressed. The educational problem has not been addressed. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had eight years of talk but no action. They\u2019ve been in a position of responsibility in the White House. The powerful interests, if you will, in Washington, D.C. and been unable to work with others. Medicare is a good example. The Breaux Commission, a good effort at a bipartisan solution for Medicare whether you bought or didn\u2019t buy the answer that was generated, the fact is the administration set it up and pulled the plug on it because they would rather have an issue, not a solution. They haven\u2019t lead from a bipartisan standpoint and I think Al Gore\u2019s record isn\u2019t very good."}

I try hard to put myself in that position and imagine what it would be like, but I\u2019ve always been part of the majority, never part of a minority group. It has to be a horrible experience. The sense of anger and frustration and rage that go with knowing that the only reason you were stopped, the only reason you were arrested, was because of the color of your skin would make me extraordinarily angry, and I\u2019m not sure how I would respond. I think that we have to recognize that while we\u2019ve made enormous progress in the U.S. in racial relations and come a great long way, we still have a very long way to go. We still have not only the problems we\u2019re talking about here tonight in terms of the problems you mentioned in profiling, but beyond that, we still have an achievement gap in education, income differentials, differences in life span. We still have, I think, a society that \u2014 where we haven\u2019t done enough yet to live up to that standard that we\u2019d all like to live up to. I think in terms of equality of opportunity, that we judge people as individuals. As Martin Luther King said, we ought to judge people on the content of their character instead of the color of their skin. I would hope we can continue to make progress int that regard in the years ahead."}

The fact of the matter is we live in a free society, and freedom means freedom for everybody. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to choose, and we shouldn\u2019t be able to choose and say you get to live free and you don\u2019t. That means people should be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to enter into. It\u2019s no one\u2019s business in terms of regulating behavior in that regard. The next step then, of course, is the question you ask of whether or not there ought to be some kind of official sanction of the relationships or if these relationships should be treated the same as a traditional marriage. That\u2019s a tougher problem. That\u2019s not a slam dunk. The fact of the matter is that it is regulated by the states. I think different states are likely to come to different conclusions, and that\u2019s appropriate. I don\u2019t think there should necessarily be a federal policy in this area. I try to be open minded about it as much as I can and tolerant of those relationships. And like Joe, I\u2019m also wrestling with the extent to which there ought to be legal sanction of those relationships. I think we ought to do everything we can to tolerate and accommodate whatever kind of relationships people want to enter into."}

I think the areas that I would bring are the things that Governor Bush emphasized when he picked me. That I have been White House Chief of Staff and ran the White House under President Ford. Spent ten years in the House, eight of that in the leadership. Served as Secretary of Defense, and then had significant experience in the private sector. I think that where there are differences between Joe and myself in terms of background and experience, I clearly have spent a lot of time in executive positions running large organizations both in private business as well as in government. And that is a set of qualifications that Governor Bush found attractive when he selected me. I\u2019ll leave it at that."}

Let\u2019s see if I can put them in those terms. Joe established an outstanding record, I thought, in his work on this whole question of violence in the media. And the kinds of materials that were being peddled to our children. And many of us on the Republican side admired him for that. There is, I must say, the view now that having joined with Al Gore on the ticket on the other side, that the depth of conviction that we had admired before isn\u2019t quite as strong as it was, perhaps, in the past. The temptation on the one hand to criticize the activities of the industry, as was pointed out recently in the Federal Trade Commission where they\u2019re taking clearly material meant for adults and selling it to our children, while at the same time they are participating in fundraising events with some of the people responsible for that activity has been a source of concern for many of us. We were especially disturbed, Joe, at a recent fundraiser you attended where there was a comedian that got up and criticized George Bush\u2019s religion. I know you\u2019re not responsible for having uttered any words of criticism of his religion. My concern would be, frankly, that you haven\u2019t been as \u2014 as consistent as you had been in the past. That a lot of your good friends like Bill Bennett and others of us who had admired your firmness of purpose over the years have felt that you\u2019re not quite the crusader for that cause that you once were."}

I\u2019ve enjoyed the debate this evening. And thank the folks here at the Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done a tremendous job of making this possible. This is a very important decision you\u2019re going to make on November 7. We have a fundamental choice between whether or not we continue with our old ways of big government, high taxes and ever more intrusive bureaucracy, or whether we take a new course for a new era. Governor Bush and I want to pursue the new course. We want to reform the Social Security system to guarantee benefits will be there for our retired folks, as well as make it possible for our young people to invest a portion of their payroll tax into a retirement account that they\u2019ll control and give them greater control over their own lives. We want to reform the Medicare system to make certain the benefits are there for our senior citizens, but also to provide prescription drug coverage for them and give them a range of choices in terms of the kind of insurance we have. We want to reform the education system. We want to restore our public schools to the greatness they once represented so that every parent has the opportunity to choose what is best for their child and so that every child has an opportunity to share in the American dream. We also want to reform the tax code. We think it\u2019s very important now that we have a surplus, that a portion of that surplus go back to the people who earned it. It\u2019s not the government\u2019s money, it\u2019s your money. You\u2019re entitled to it, and we would like to see to it that we provide tax relief for everybody who pays taxes. Finally, we think it\u2019s very important to rebuild the U.S. military. The military is in trouble. The trends are in the wrong direction. The finest men and women in uniform that you\u2019ll find anyplace in the world but they deserve our support. They deserve the resources that we need to provide for them and they deserve good leadership. George Bush is the man to do this. I\u2019ve seen him do it in Texas. What we need is to be able to reach across the aisle. Put together coalitions of Republicans and Democrats and build the kinds of coalitions that will get something done, finally, in Washington. George Bush is good man, an honorable man, a man of great integrity. He will make a first rate president."}

First question is what\u2019s in the best interests of the United States? What\u2019s in the best interests of our people? When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question. Is it in our nation\u2019s interests? Peace in the Middle East is in our nation\u2019s interests. Having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nation\u2019s interests. Strong relations in Europe is in our nation\u2019s interest. I\u2019ve thought a lot about what it means to be the president. I also understand that an administration is not one person, but an administration is dedicated citizens who are called by the president to serve the country, to serve a cause greater than self, and so I\u2019ve thought about an administration of people who represent all America, but people who understand my compassionate and conservative philosophy. I haven\u2019t started naming names except for one person, and that\u2019s Mr. Richard Cheney who I thought did a great job the other night. He\u2019s a vice presidential nominee who represents \u2014 I think people got to see why I picked him. He\u2019s man of solid judgment and he\u2019s going to be a person to stand by my side. One of the things I\u2019ve done in Texas is I\u2019ve been able to put together a good team of people. I\u2019ve been able to set clear goals. The goals ought to be an education system that leaves no child behind, Medicare for our seniors, a Social Security system that\u2019s safe and secure, foreign policy that\u2019s in our nation\u2019s interest, and a strong military, and then bring people together to achieve those goals. That\u2019s what a Chief Executive Officer does. So I\u2019ve thought long and hard about the honor of being the President of the United States."}
{"Title":"October 11, 2000 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Second Gore-Bush Presidential Debate","Date":971222400000,"Participants":"Gore-Bush","Moderators":"MODERATOR","Speaker":"GORE","Text":"Yes, Jim. I\u2019ve thought a lot about that particular question, and I see our greatest national strength coming from what we stand for in the world. I see it as a question of values. It is a great tribute to our founders that 224 years later this nation is now looked to by the peoples on every other continent and the peoples from every part of this earth as a kind of model for what their future could be. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans. It\u2019s really true, even the ones that sometimes shake their fists at us. As soon as they have a change that allows the people to speak freely, they\u2019re wanting to develop some kind of blueprint that will help them be like us more, freedom, free markets, political freedom. So I think first and foremost our power ought to be wielded to in ways that form a more perfect union. The power of example is America\u2019s greatest power in the world. And that means, for example, standing up for human rights. It means addressing the problems of injustice and inequity, along the lines of race and ethnicity here at home, because in all these other places around the world where they\u2019re having these terrible problems, when they feel hope, it is often because they see in us a reflection of their potential. So we\u2019ve got to enforce our civil rights laws. We\u2019ve got to deal with things like racial profiling. And we have to keep our military strong. We have the strongest military, and I\u2019ll do whatever is necessary, if I\u2019m president, to make sure that it stays that way. But our real power comes, I think, from our values."}

I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll look at us with envy. It really depends upon how our nation conducts itself in foreign policy. If we\u2019re an arrogant nation, they\u2019ll resent us. If we\u2019re a humble nation, but strong, they\u2019ll welcome us. And it\u2019s \u2014 our nation stands alone right now in the world in terms of power, and that\u2019s why we have to be humble. And yet project strength in a way that promotes freedom. So I don\u2019t think they ought to look at us in any way other than what we are. We\u2019re a freedom-loving nation and if we\u2019re an arrogant nation they\u2019ll view us that way, but if we\u2019re a humble nation they\u2019ll respect us."}

I agree with that. I think that one of the problems that we have faced in the world is that we are so much more powerful than any single nation has been in relationship to the rest of the world than at any time in history, that I know about, anyway. That there is some resentment of U.S. power. So I think that the idea of humility is an important one. But I think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world. We have to protect our capacity to push forward what America\u2019s all about. That means not only military strength and our values, it also means keeping our economy strong. You know, in the last, or two decades ago, it was routine for leaders of foreign countries to come over here and say you guys have got to do something about these horrendous deficits because it\u2019s causing tremendous problems for the rest of the world, and we were lectured to all the time. The fact that we have the strongest economy in history today is not good enough. We need to do more.

We do have an obligation, but we can\u2019t be all things to all people. We can help build coalitions but we can\u2019t put our troops all around the world. We can lend money but we have to do it wisely. We shouldn\u2019t be lending money to corrupt officials. So we got to be guarded in our generosity."}
{"Title":"October 11, 2000 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Second Gore-Bush Presidential Debate","Date":971222400000,"Participants":"Gore-Bush","Moderators":"MODERATOR","Speaker":"GORE","Text":"The first priority has to be on ending the violence, dampening down the tensions that have arisen there. We need to call upon Syria to release the three Israeli soldiers who have been captured. We need to insist that Arafat send out instructions to halt some of the provocative acts of violence that have been going on. I think that we also have to keep a weather eye toward Saddam Hussein because he is taking advantage of this situation to once again make threats, and he needs to understand that he\u2019s not only dealing with Israel, he is dealing \u2014 he\u2019s dealing with us if he is making the kind of threats that he\u2019s talking about there. The use of diplomacy in this situation has already, well, it goes hour-by-hour and day-by-day now. It\u2019s a very tense situation there. But in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there. It\u2019s too much to hope that this is going to continue, but I do hope that it will continue. Our country has been very active with regular conversations with the leaders there. And we just have to take it day-to-day right now. But one thing I would say where diplomacy is concerned, Israel should feel absolutely secure about one thing. Our bonds with Israel are larger than agreements or disagreements on some details of diplomatic initiatives. They are historic, they are strong, and they are enduring. And our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shepherd."}

Like the vice president, I call on Chairman Arafat to have his people pull back to make the peace. I think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the Middle East. I want everybody to know should I be the president Israel\u2019s going to be our friend. I\u2019m going to stand by Israel. Secondly, that I think it\u2019s important to reach out to moderate Arab nations, like Jordan and Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. It\u2019s important to be friends with people when you don\u2019t need each other so that when you do there\u2019s a strong bond of friendship. And that\u2019s going to be particularly important in dealing not only with situations such as now occurring in Israel, but with Saddam Hussein. The coalition against Saddam has fallen apart or it\u2019s unraveling, let\u2019s put it that way. The sanctions are being violated. We don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s developing weapons of mass destruction. He better not be or there\u2019s going to be a consequence should I be the president. But it\u2019s important to have credibility and credibility is formed by being strong with your friends and resolute in your determination. One of the reasons why I think it\u2019s important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace to be able to say to the Saddam Hussein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of the world or the Iranians, don\u2019t dare threaten our friends. It\u2019s also important to keep strong ties in the Middle East, credible ties, because of the energy crisis we\u2019re now in. After all, a lot of the energy is produced from the Middle East, and so I appreciate what the administration is doing. I hope to get a sense of should I be fortunate to be the president how my administration will react to the Middle East."}

And if we throw away that ability to serve as an honest broker, then we have thrown \u2014 we will have thrown away a strategic asset that\u2019s important not only to us but also to Israel."}

I know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations. But the fact is that that\u2019s the situation that was left when I got there. And we have maintained the sanctions. Now I want to go further. I want to give robust support to the groups that are trying to overthrow Saddam Hussein, and I know there are allegations that they\u2019re too weak to do it, but that\u2019s what they said about the forces that were opposing Milosevic in Serbia, and you know, the policy of enforcing sanctions against Serbia has just resulted in a spectacular victory for democracy just in the past week, and it seems to me that having taken so long to see the sanctions work there, building upon the policy of containment that was successful over a much longer period of time against the former Soviet Union in the communist block, seems a little early to declare that we should give up on the sanctions. I know the governor\u2019s not necessarily saying that but, you know, all of these flights that have come in, all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime, I\u2019m told, except for three where they notified, and they\u2019re trying to break out of the box, there\u2019s no question about it.

I thought he made the right decision to do so. I didn\u2019t think he necessarily made the right decision to take land troops off the table right before we committed ourselves offensively, but nevertheless, it worked. The administration deserves credit for having made it work. It is important for NATO to have it work. It\u2019s important for NATO to be strong and confident and to help keep the peace in Europe. And one of the reasons I felt so strongly that the United States needed to participate was because of our relations with NATO, and NATO is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future. Now, there\u2019s more work to do. Remains to be seen, however, whether or not there\u2019s going to be a political settlement in Kosovo, and I certainly hope there is one. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m on record as saying at some point in time I hope our European friends become the peacekeepers in Bosnia and in the Balkans. I hope that they put the troops on the ground so that we can withdraw our troops and focus our military on fighting and winning war."}

When I was in the senate before I became vice president I was pushing for stronger action against Milosevic. He caused the death of so many people. He was the last communist party boss there and then he became a dictator that by some other label he was still essentially a communist dictator. And unfortunately now he is trying to reassert himself in Serbian politics. Already just today the members of his political party said that they were going to ignore the orders of the new president of Serbia, and that they question his legitimacy, and he\u2019s still going to try to be actively involved. He is an indicted war criminal. He should be held accountable. Now, I did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier, and maybe I have heard, maybe I have heard the previous statements wrong, Governor. In some of the discussions we\u2019ve had about when it\u2019s appropriate for the U.S. to use force around the world, at times the standards that you\u2019ve laid down have given me the impression that if it\u2019s something like a genocide taking place or what they called ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, that that alone would not be, that that wouldn\u2019t be the kind of situation that would cause you to think that the U.S. ought to get involved with troops. Now, have to be other factors involved for me to want to be involved. But by itself, that to me can bring into play a fundamental American strategic interest because I think it\u2019s based on our values. Now, have I got that wrong?"}

If I think it\u2019s in our nation\u2019s strategic interest I\u2019ll commit troops. I thought it was in our strategic interests to keep Milosevic in check because of our relations in NATO, and that\u2019s why I took the position I took. I think it\u2019s important for NATO to be strong and confident. I felt like unchecked Milosevic would harm NATO, and so it depends on the situation, Mr. Vice President."}

I think our troops ought to be used to fight and win war. I think our troops ought to be used to help overthrow the dictator when it\u2019s in our best interests.

It was a horrible situation, no one liked to see it on our TV screens, but it\u2019s a case where we need to make sure we have an early warning system in place in places where there could be ethnic cleansing and genocide the way we saw it there in Rwanda. And that\u2019s a case where we need to use our influence to have countries in Africa come together and help deal with the situation. The administration, seems like we\u2019re having a great love fest tonight, but the administration made the right decision on training Nigerian troops for situations just such as this in Rwanda, and so I thought they made the right decision not to send U.S. troops into Rwanda."}

Fine. We did, actually, send troops into Rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures. My wife Tipper, who is here, actually went on a military plane with General Sholicatchvieli on one of those flights. But I think in retrospect we were too late getting in there. We could have saved more lives if we had acted earlier. But I do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason, Jim. One of the criteria that I think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military forces. If we tried everything else, if we have allies. In the Balkans we have allies, NATO, ready, willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden. In Africa we did not. Now, we have tried \u2014 our country has tried to create an Africa crisis response team there, and we\u2019ve met some resistance. We have had some luck with Nigeria, but in Sierra Leon, and now that Nigeria has become a democracy, and we hope it stays that way, then maybe we can build on that. But because we had no allies and because it was very unclear that we could actually accomplish what we would want to accomplish about putting military forces there, I think it was the right thing not to jump in, as heartbreaking as it was, but I think we should have come in much quicker with the humanitarian mission."}

And we\u2019ve got to do a lot of work in Africa to promote democracy and trade, and there are some \u2014 Vice President mentioned Nigeria is a fledgling democracy. We have to work with Nigeria. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important continent. But there\u2019s got to be priorities, and Middle East is a priority for a lot of reasons, as is Europe and the Far East, our own hemisphere. And those are my four top priorities should I be the president, not to say we won\u2019t be engaged nor work hard to get other nations to come together to prevent atrocity. I thought the best example of a way to handle the situation was East Timor when we provided logistical support to the Australians, support that only we can provide. I thought that was a good model. But we can\u2019t be all things to all people in the world, Jim. And I think that\u2019s where maybe the vice president and I begin to have some differences. I\u2019m worried about overcommitting our military around the world. I want to be judicious in its use. You mentioned Haiti. I wouldn\u2019t have sent troops to Haiti. I didn\u2019t think it was a mission worthwhile. It was a nation building mission, and it was not very successful. It cost us billions, a couple billions of dollars, and I\u2019m not so sure democracy is any better off in Haiti than it was before."}

I would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of American troops overseas. I think we have to be very reticent about that. But look, Jim, the world is changing so rapidly. The way I see it, the world is getting much closer together. Like it or not, we are now \u2014 the United States is now the natural leader of the world. All these other countries are looking to us. Now, just because we cannot be involved everywhere, and shouldn\u2019t be, doesn\u2019t mean that we should shy away from going in anywhere. Now, both of us are kind of, I guess, stating the other\u2019s position in a maximalist extreme way, but I think there is a difference here. This idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century, World War II. During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States. The lesson was that in the aftermath of World War I, we kind of turned our backs and left them to their own devices and they brewed up a lot of trouble that quickly became World War II. And acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did. We got intimately involved in building NATO and other structures there. We still have lots of troops in Europe. And what did we do in the late \u201940\u2019s and \u201950\u2019s and \u201960\u2019s? We were nation building. And it was economic. But it was also military. And the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there. We had civil administrators come in to set up their ways of building their towns back."}

I think one of the lessons in between World War I and World War II is we let our military atrophy. And we can\u2019t do that. We\u2019ve got to rebuild our military. But one of the problems we have in the military is we\u2019re in a lot of places around the world. And I mentioned one, and that\u2019s the Balkans. I would very much like to get our troops out of there. I recognize we can\u2019t do it now, nor do I advocate an immediate withdrawal. That would be an abrogation of our agreement with NATO. No one is suggesting that. But I think it ought to be one of our priorities to work with our European friends to convince them to put troops on the ground. And there is an example. Haiti is another example. Now there are some places where I think \u2014 you know, I\u2019ve supported the administration in Columbia. I think it\u2019s important for us to be training Columbians in that part of the world. The hemisphere is in our interest to have a peaceful Columbia. But \u2014"}

And when it gets overextended, morale drops. I strongly believe we need to have a military presence in the Korean peninsula, not only to keep the peace in the peninsula, but to keep regional stability. And I strongly believe we need to keep a presence in NATO, but I\u2019m going to be judicious as to how to use the military. It needs to be in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear, and the extra strategy obvious."}

I certainly don\u2019t disagree that we ought to get our troops home from places like the Balkans as soon as we can, as soon as the mission is complete. That\u2019s what we did in Haiti. There are no more than a handful of American military personnel in Haiti now. And Haitians have their problems, but we gave them a chance to restore democracy. That\u2019s really about all we can do. But if you have a situation like that right in our backyard with chaos about to break out and flotillas forming to come across the water, and all kinds of violence there, right in one of our neighboring countries there, then I think that we did the right thing there. And as for this idea of nation building, the phrase sounds grandiose. And, you know, we can\u2019t be \u2014 we can\u2019t allow ourselves to get overextended. I certainly agree with that. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve supported building up our capacity. I\u2019ve devoted in the budget I\u2019ve proposed, as I said last week, more than twice as much as the governor has proposed. I think that it\u2019s in better shape now than he generally does. We\u2019ve had some disagreements about that. He said that two divisions would have to report not ready for duty, and that\u2019s not what the joint chiefs say. But there\u2019s no doubt that we have to continue building up readiness and military strength. And we have to also be very cautious in the way we use our military."}

I believe we ought to have foreign aid, but I don\u2019t think we ought to just have foreign aid for the sake of foreign aid. I think foreign aid needs to be used to encourage markets and reform. I think a lot of times we just spend aid and say we feel better about it and it ends up being spent the wrong way, and there\u2019s some pretty egregious examples recently. One being Russia, where we had IMF loans that ended up in the pockets of a lot of powerful people and didn\u2019t help the nation. I think the IMF has got a role in the world, but I don\u2019t want to see the IMF out there as a way to say to world bankers, if you make a bad loan, we\u2019ll bail you out. It needs to be available for emergency situations. I thought the President did the right thing with Mexico and was very strongly supportive of the administration in Mexico. But I don\u2019t think the IMF ought to be a stop loss for people who ought to be able to evaluate risks themselves. So I\u2019ll look at every place where we\u2019re investing money. I just want to make sure the return is good."}

I think there need to be reforms in the IMF. I\u2019ve generally supported it, but I\u2019ve seen them make some calls that I thought were highly questionable. And I think that there\u2019s a general agreement in many parts of the world now that there ought to be changes in the IMF. The World Bank I think is generally doing a better job, but I think one of the big issues here that doesn\u2019t get nearly enough attention is the issue of corruption. The governor mentioned it earlier. I\u2019ve worked on this issue. It\u2019s an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies, like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials, that\u2019s one of the worst forms of it. And we have got to again lead by example and help these other countries that are trying to straighten out their situations find the tools in order to do it. I just think, Jim, that this is an absolutely unique period in world history. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coming together, as I said, they\u2019re looking to us. And we have a fundamental choice to make. Are we going to step up to the plate as a nation the way we did after World War II, the way that generation of heroes said okay, the United States is going to be the leader. And the world benefitted tremendously from the courage that they showed in those post-war years. I think that in the aftermath of the Cold War, it\u2019s time for us to do something very similar, to step up to the plate, to provide the leadership on the environment, leadership to make sure the world economy keeps moving in the right direction. Again, that means not running big deficits here and not squandering our surplus. It means having intelligent decisions that keep our prosperity going and shepherds that economic strength so that we can provide that leadership role."}

I\u2019m not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say this is the way it\u2019s got to be. We can help. And maybe it\u2019s just our difference in government, the way we view government. I want to empower the people. I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s the role of the United States to walk into a country and say, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we do it this way, so should you.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d I think we can help. I know we\u2019ve got to encourage democracy in the marketplaces. But take Russia, for example. We went into Russia, we said here is some IMF money, and it ended up in Viktor Chemomyrdin\u2019s pocket, and others, and yet we played like there was reform. The only people that are going to reform Russia are Russia. They\u2019re going to have to make the decision themselves. Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and\/or entities invest capital, there\u2019s a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy. But Russia has to make the decision. We can work with them on security matters, for example, but it\u2019s their call to make. So I\u2019m not exactly sure where the vice president is coming from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we do it this way, so should you.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Now, we trust freedom. We know freedom is a powerful, powerful, powerful force, much bigger than the United States of America, as we saw recently in the Balkans. But maybe I misunderstand where you\u2019re coming from, Mr. Vice President, but I think the United States must be humble and must be proud and confident of our values, but humble in how we treat nations that are figuring out how to chart their own course."}

The only thing an executive order can accomplish is to ban it in federal law enforcement agencies, but I would also support a law in the Congress that would have the effect of doing the same thing. I just \u2014 I think that racial profiling is a serious problem. I remember when the stories first came out about the stops in New Jersey by the highway patrol there. And I know it\u2019s been going on a long time. In some ways this is just a new label for something that has been going on for years. But I have to confess that it was the first time that I really focused on it in a new way. And I was surprised at the extent of it. And I think we\u2019ve now got so many examples around the country that we really have to find ways to end this. Imagine what it \u2014 what it is like for someone to be singled out unfairly, unjustly, and feel the unfair force of law simply because of race or ethnicity. Now, that runs counter to what the United States of America is all about at our core. And it\u2019s not an easy problem to solve. But if I am entrusted with the presidency, it will be the first Civil Rights Act of the 21st century."}

That\u2019s just flat wrong, and that\u2019s not what America is all about. And so we ought to do everything we can to end racial profiling. One of my concerns, though, is I don\u2019t want to federalize the local police forces. I want to \u2014 obviously in the egregious cases we need to enforce civil rights law, but we need to make sure that internal affairs divisions at the local level do their job and be given a chance to do their job. I believe in local control of governments, and obviously if they don\u2019t there needs to be a consequence at the federal level. But it\u2019s very important that we not overstep our bounds and I think most people \u2014 most police officers are good, dedicated, honorable citizens who are doing their job, putting their lives at risk who aren\u2019t bigoted or aren\u2019t prejudiced. I don\u2019t think they ought to be held guilty. But I do think we need to find out where racial profiling occurs and do something about it and say to the local folks, get it done. And if you can\u2019t, there will be a federal consequence."}

And I also agree that most police officers, of course, are doing a good job and hate this practice also. I talked to an African-American police officer in Springfield, Massachusetts not long ago who raised this question and said that in his opinion one of the biggest solutions is in the training. And not only the training in police procedures, but human relations. And I think that racial profiling is part of a larger issue of how we deal with race in America. And as for singling people out because of race, you know, James Byrd was singled out because of his race in Texas. And other Americans have been singled out because of their race or ethnicity. And that\u2019s why I think we can embody our values by passing a hate crimes law. I think these crimes are different. I think they\u2019re different because they\u2019re based on prejudice and hatred, which gives rise to crimes that have not just a single victim, but they\u2019re intended to stigmatize and dehumanize a whole group of people."}

And guess what? The three men who murdered James Byrd, guess what\u2019s going to happen to them? They\u2019re going to be put to death. A jury found them guilty. It\u2019s going to be hard to punish them any worse after they get put to death. And it\u2019s the right cause. It\u2019s the right decision. Secondly, there is other forms of racial profiling that goes on in America. Arab-Americans are racially profiled in what is called secret evidence. People are stopped, and we have to do something about that. My friend, Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, is pushing a law to make sure that Arab-Americans are treated with respect. So racial profiling isn\u2019t just an issue at local police forces. It\u2019s an issue throughout our society. And as we become a diverse society, we\u2019re going to have to deal with it more and more. I believe, though \u2014 I believe, as sure as I\u2019m sitting here, that most Americans really care. They\u2019re tolerant people. They\u2019re good, tolerant people. It\u2019s the very few that create most of the crises, and we just have to find them and deal with them."}

In public education when we just move children through the schools. My friend, Phyllis Hunter, is here. She had one of the greatest lines of all lines. She said, reading is the new civil right. She\u2019s right. And to make sure our society is as hopeful as it possibly can be, every single child in America must be educated. I mean every child. It starts with making sure every child learns to read. K-2 diagnostic testing so we know whether or not there\u2019s a deficiency. Curriculum that works and phonics needs to be an integral part of our reading curriculum. Intensive reading laboratories, teacher retraining. I mean, there needs to be a wholesale effort against racial profiling, which is illiterate children. We can do better in our public schools. We can close an achievement gap, and it starts with making sure we have strong accountability, Jim. One of the cornerstones of reform, and good reform, is to measure. Because when you measure you can ask the question, do they know? Is anybody being profiled? Is anybody being discriminated against? It becomes a tool, a corrective tool. And I believe the federal government must say that if you receive any money, any money from the federal government for disadvantaged children, for example, you must show us whether or not the children are learning. And if they are, fine. And if they\u2019re not, there has to be a consequence. And so to make sure we end up getting rid of basic structural prejudice is education. There is nothing more prejudiced than not educating a child."}

But that having been said, I believe that \u2014 well, first of all, let me say that the governor and I agree on some things where this subject is concerned. I will not do anything to affect the rights of hunters or sportsmen. I think that homeowners have to be respected and their right to have a gun if they wish to. The problem I see is that there are too many guns getting into the hands of children, and criminals, and people who, for whatever reason, some kind of history of stalking or domestic abuse really should not be able to get guns. I think these assault weapons are a problem. So I favor closing the gun show loophole. In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to close it, but then the majority in the House of Representatives went the other way. That\u2019s still pending. If we could get agreement on that, maybe they could pass that in the final days of this Congress. I think we ought to restore the three-day waiting period under the Brady Law. I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively. Some of the restrictions that have been placed by the Congress in the last couple of years. I think \u2014 in the last few years I think have been unfortunate. I think that we ought to make all schools gun free. Have a gun-free zone around every school in this country. I think that measures like these are important. Child safety trigger locks on a mandatory basis, and others."}
{"Title":"October 11, 2000 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Second Gore-Bush Presidential Debate","Date":971222400000,"Participants":"Gore-Bush","Moderators":"MODERATOR","Speaker":"BUSH","Text":"Well, it starts with enforcing law. When you say loud and clear to somebody if you\u2019re going to carry a gun illegally, we\u2019re going to arrest you. If you\u2019re going to sell a gun illegally, you need to be arrested. If you commit a crime with a gun, there needs to be absolute certainty in the law. And that means that the local law enforcement officials need help at the federal level. Programs like Project Exile where the federal government intensifies arresting people who illegally use guns. And we haven\u2019t done a very good job of that at the federal level recently. And I\u2019m going to make it a priority. Secondly, I don\u2019t think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldn\u2019t have them. That\u2019s why I support instant background checks at gun shows. One of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not. In Texas I tried to do something innovative. There\u2019s a lot of talk about trigger locks being on guns sold in the future. I support that. But I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come and get one for free. So we\u2019re distributing in our State of Texas for free. I think we ought to raise the age at which a juvenile can carry a handgun from 18 to 21. I disagree with the vice president on this issue. He is for registration of guns. I think the only people that are going to show up to register or get a license \u2014 I guess licensing like a driver\u2019s license for a gun, the only people that are going to show up are law-abiding citizens. The criminal is not going to show up and say hey, give me my I.D. card. It\u2019s the law-abiding citizens who will do that.

And the \u201cLos Angeles Times\u201d spent a lot of ink going into that. But I am not for doing anything that would affect hunters or sportsmen, rifles, shotguns, existing handguns. I do think that sensible gun safety measures are warranted now. Look, this is the year \u2014 this is in the aftermath of Columbine, and Paducah, and all the places in our country where the nation has been shocked by these weapons in the hands of the wrong people. The woman who bought the guns for the two boys who did that killing at Columbine said that if she had had to give her name and fill out a form there, she would not have bought those guns. That conceivably could have prevented that tragedy."}

Let me say something about Columbine. Listen, we\u2019ve got gun laws. He says we ought to have gun-free schools. Everybody believes that. I\u2019m sure every state in the union has got them. You can\u2019t carry a gun into a school. And there ought to be a consequence when you do carry a gun into a school. But Columbine spoke to a larger issue. It\u2019s really a matter of culture. It\u2019s a culture that somewhere along the line we\u2019ve begun to disrespect life. Where a child can walk in and have their heart turned dark as a result of being on the Internet and walk in and decide to take somebody else\u2019s life? So gun laws are important, no question about it, but so is loving children, and character education classes, and faith-based programs being a part of after-school programs. Some desperate child needs to have somebody put their arm around them and say, we love you. So there\u2019s a \u2014 this is a society that \u2014 of ours that\u2019s got to do a better job of teaching children right from wrong. And we can enforce law. But there seems to be a lot of preoccupation on \u2014 not certainly only in this debate, but just in general on law. But there\u2019s a larger law. Love your neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself. And that\u2019s where our society must head if we\u2019re going to be a peaceful and prosperous society."}

And if I\u2019m elected president, I will do something about that. But I think that we \u2014 I think we have to start with better parenting. But I don\u2019t think that we can ignore the role played by guns. I mean, the fact is that there \u2014 even though no state wants them, there are guns in some schools. And the reason it\u2019s so difficult for schools to control that is because in recent years there has been a flood of cheap handguns that are so widely available that kids are finding ways to get ahold of them. And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands."}

We believe in tough love. We say, if you get caught carrying a gun, you\u2019re automatically detained. And that\u2019s what needs to happen. We\u2019ve got laws.

For those what I think we need to do is to develop an investment-type vehicle that would be an incentive for them to invest, like medical savings accounts with rollover capacity. In other words, you say to a youngster, it will be in your financial interest to start saving for future illness, but for the working folks that do want to have health care that can\u2019t afford it, a couple of things we need to do. One, we need more community health centers. I\u2019ve developed \u2014 put out money in my budget to expand community health centers all around the country. These are places where people can get primary care. Secondly \u2014 and they\u2019re good. They\u2019re very important parts of the safety net of health care. Secondly, that you get a $2,000 rebate from the government if you\u2019re a family of $30,000 or less \u2014 it scales down as you get higher \u2014 that you can use to purchase health care in the private markets. It will be a huge down payment for a pretty darn good system. If you allow \u2014 also allow \u2014 convince states to \u2014 allow states to allow the mother to match some of the children\u2019s health insurance money with it, the pool purchasing power. And to make health care more affordable, allow business associations like the National Federal of Independent Business or the Chamber of Commerce or the National Restaurant Association to write association plans across jurisdictional lines so that small businesses have got the capacity to have national pooling to drive the cost of insurance down. I think that\u2019s the very best way to go. It empowers people, it trusts people, it makes \u2014 and it\u2019s a practical way to encourage people to purchase health care insurance."}

I want a smaller and smarter government. I have been in charge of this reinventing government streamlining project that\u2019s reduced the size of government by more than 300,000 people in the last several years. And the budget plan that I\u2019ve put out, according to the \u201cLos Angeles Times\u201d again, the way these things are typically measured as a percentage of the GDP, will bring government spending down to the lowest level in 50 years. So I want to proceed carefully to cover more people. But I think we should start by greatly expanding the so-called child health insurance or CHIP program to give health insurance to every single child in this country. I think it\u2019s intolerable that we have so many millions of children without any health insurance. So it\u2019s one of my top priorities. Now, I know that we have some disagreements on this. And I\u2019m sorry to tell you that, you know, there is a record here. And Texas ranks 49th out of the 50 states in health care \u2014 in children with health care. 49th for women with health care, and 50th for families with health care. So it is a priority for me. I guarantee you. I\u2019m not aware of any program \u2014 well, I\u2019ll just leave it at that. I think it ought to be a top priority."}

Secondly, we spend $4.7 billion a year on the uninsured in the State of Texas. Our rate of uninsured, the percentage of uninsured in Texas has gone down, while the percentage of uninsured in America has gone up. Our CHIPS program got a late start because our government meets only four months out of every two years, Mr. Vice President. It may come as a shock for somebody who has been in Washington for so long. But actually limited government can work in the second largest state in the union. And therefore Congress passes the bill after our session in 1997 ended, we passed an enabling legislation in 1999. We\u2019ve signed up over 110,000 children to the CHIPS program. For comparable states our size, we\u2019re signing them up as fast as any other state. You can quote all the numbers you want, but I\u2019m telling you we care about our people in Texas.

And as for why it happened, I\u2019m no expert on the Texas procedures, but what my friends there tell me is that the governor opposed a measure put forward by Democrats in the legislature to expand the number of children that would be covered. And instead directed the money toward a tax cut, a significant part of which went to wealthy interests. He declared the need for a new tax cut for the oil companies in Texas an emergency need, and so the money was taken away from the CHIP program. There\u2019s \u2014 you don\u2019t have to take my word for this. There is now a federal judge\u2019s opinion about the current management of this program ordering the State of Texas to do \u2014 you should read that judge\u2019s language about this. I believe there are 1.4 million children in Texas who do not have health insurance. 600,000 of whom, and maybe some of those have since gotten it, but as of a year ago 600,000 of them were actually eligible for it but they couldn\u2019t sign up for it because of the barriers that they had set up."}

And let me tell you exactly why I think that the choice he made to give a tax cut for the oil companies and others before addressing this \u2014 I mean, if you were the governor of a state that was dead last in health care for families, and all of a sudden you found yourself with the biggest surplus your state had ever had in its history, wouldn\u2019t you want to maybe use some of it to climb from 50th to, say, 45 or 40 or something or maybe better? I would. Now, but here is why it\u2019s directly relevant, Jim. Because by his own budget numbers, his proposals for spending on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy are more than the new spending proposals that he has made for health care and education and national defense all combined. According to his own numbers. So it\u2019s not a question of his heart, as far as I know. It\u2019s a question of priorities and values. See, you know \u2014"}

And in return, get one-fifth of the benefits, because most of the tax reductions go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder. That stands in stark contrast, by the way, to a man who is going to leave 50 million \u2014 50 million Americans out of tax relief. We just have a different point of view. It\u2019s a totally different point of view. He believes only the right people ought to get tax relief. I believe everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief. Let me go back to Texas, for example, for a minute. We pay 4.7 billion. I can\u2019t emphasize to you how much. I signed a bill that puts CHIPS in place. The bill finally came out at the end of the 1999 session. We\u2019re working hard to sign up children. We\u2019re doing it faster than any other state our size, comparable state. We\u2019re making really good progress. And our state cares a lot about our children. My priority is going to be the health of our citizens. These folks have had eight years to get something done in Washington, D.C. on the uninsured. They have not done it. They\u2019ve had eight years to get something done on Medicare. And they have not got it done. And my case to the American people is, if you\u2019re happy with inactivity, stay with the horse. The horse is up here now.

I think that in this 21st century we will soon see the consequences of what\u2019s called global warming. There was a study just a few weeks ago suggesting that in summertime the north polar ice cap will be completely gone in 50 years. Already many people see the strange weather conditions that the old timers say they\u2019ve never seen before in their lifetimes. And what\u2019s happening is the level of pollution is increasing significantly. Now, here is the good news, Jim. If we take the leadership role and build the new technologies, like the new kinds of cars and trucks that Detroit is itching to build, then we can create millions of good new jobs by being first into the market with these new kinds of cars and trucks and other kinds of technologies. You know the Japanese are breathing down our necks on this. They\u2019re moving very rapidly because they know that it is a fast-growing world market. Some of these other countries, particularly in the developing world, their pollution is much worse than anywhere else and their people want higher standards of living. And so they\u2019re looking for ways to satisfy their desire for a better life and still reduce pollution at the same time. I think that holding onto the old ways and the old argument that the environment and the economy are in conflict is really outdated. We have to be bold. We have to provide leadership. Now it\u2019s true that we disagree on this. The governor said that he doesn\u2019t think this problem is necessarily caused by people. He\u2019s for letting the oil companies into the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Houston has just become the smoggiest city in the country. And Texas is number one in industrial pollution. We have a very different outlook. And I\u2019ll tell you this, I will fight for a clean environment in ways that strengthen our economy."}

And people are willing to invest capital in the brown fields don\u2019t want to do so for fear of lawsuit. I think we ought to have federal liability protection, depending upon whether or not standards have been met. The book you mentioned that Vice President Gore wrote, he also called for taxing \u2014 big energy taxes in order to clean up the environment. And now that the energy prices are high, I guess he\u2019s not advocating those big energy taxes right now. I believe we ought to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund to \u2014 with half the money going to states so states can make the right decisions for environmental quality. I think we need to have clean coal technologies. I propose $2 billion worth. By the way, I just found out the other day an interesting fact, that there is a national petroleum reserve right next to \u2014 in Prudhoe Bay that your administration opened up for exploration in that pristine area. And it was a smart move because there\u2019s gas reserves up there. We need gas pipelines to bring the gas down. Gas is a clean fuel that we can burn to \u2014 we need to make sure that if we decontrol our plants that there\u2019s mandatory \u2014 that the plants must conform to clean air standards, the grandfathered plants, that\u2019s what we did in Texas. No excuses. You must conform. In other words, there are practical things we can do. But it starts with working in a collaborative effort with states and local folks. If you own the land, every day is Earth Day. People care a lot about their land and care about their environment. Not all wisdom is in Washington, D.C. on this issue."}

However many days that young girl in Florida stood in her classroom, however long, even if it was only one day, doesn\u2019t change the fact that there are a lot of overcrowded classrooms in America and we need to do something about that.

This race is about values, it\u2019s about change, it\u2019s about giving choices to the American people. And education is my number one priority, because I think that it\u2019s the most important big major change that we can bring in our country. I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students. I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also. The difference is that while my plan starts with new accountability and maintains local control, it doesn\u2019t stop there. Because I want to give new choices to parents. To send their kids to college with a $10,000 tax deduction for college tuition per child per year. I want to reduce the size of the classrooms in this country. For one basic reason, so that students can get more one-on-one time with teachers. And the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers. I\u2019ve a plan in my budget to recruit 100,000 new, highly qualified teachers and to help local school districts build new schools. I think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and pre-school. Now, here is how that connects with all the rest of what we\u2019ve been talking about. If you have \u2014 if you squander the surplus on a huge tax cut that goes mostly to those at the top, then you can\u2019t make education the top priority. If the tax cut is your number one, two, three and four priority, you can\u2019t do education. You can\u2019t do both. You have to choose. I choose education and health care, the environment and retirement security, and I ask for your support."}

I would like to unite this country to get an agenda done that will speak to the hopes and aspirations of the future. I want to have an education system that sets high standards, local control of schools and strong accountability. No child should be left behind in America. I want to make sure we rebuild our military to keep the peace. I worry about morale in today\u2019s military. The warning signs are clear. It is time to have a new commander in chief who will rebuild the military, pay our men and women more, make sure they\u2019re housed better and have a focused mission for our military. Once and for all, I want to do something about Medicare. This issue has been too long on the table because it\u2019s been a political issue.

Tipper and I were good friends with Mel and Randy, and I know that all of us here want to extend our sympathy and condolences to Jean and the family and to the Sifford family. And I would just like to say that this debate in a way is a living tribute to Mel Carnahan because he loved the vigorous discussion of ideas in our democracy. He was a fantastic governor of Missouri.

Now, Mr. Hankins, I think that the situation that you describe has gotten completely out of hand. Doctors are giving prescriptions, they\u2019re recommending treatments, and then their recommendations are being overruled by HMOs and insurance companies. That is unacceptable.

As a matter of fact, I brought Republicans and Democrats together to do just that in the State of Texas to get a patient\u2019s bill of rights through. It requires a different kind of leadership style to do it, though. You see, in order to get something done on behalf of the people, you have to put partisanship aside, and that\u2019s what we did in my state. We have one of the most advanced patient\u2019s bill of rights. It says, for example, that a woman doesn\u2019t have to go through a gate keeper to go to her gynecologist. It says that you can\u2019t gag a doctor, doctor can advise you. The HMO, the insurance company, can\u2019t gag that doctor from giving you full advice. And this particular bill, it allows patients to choose a doctor, their own doctor if they want to. But we did something else that was interesting. We\u2019re one of the first states that said you can sue an HMO for denying you proper coverage. Now there\u2019s what\u2019s called an Independent Review Organization that you have to go through first. It says if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a complaint with your insurance company, you can take your complaint to an objective body. If the objective body rules on your behalf, the insurance company must follow those rules. However, if the insurance company doesn\u2019t follow the findings of the IRO, then that becomes a cause of action in a court of law. It\u2019s time for our nation to come together and do what\u2019s right for the people, and I think this is right for the people.

They like it because it doesn\u2019t accomplish what I think really needs to be accomplished to give the decisions back to the doctors and nurses and give you a right of appeal to somebody other than the HMO or insurance company, let you go to the nearest emergency room without having to call an HMO before you call 911, to let you see a specialist if you need to, and it has strong bipartisan support. It is being blocked by the Republican leadership in the Congress."}

Well, it\u2019s in this committee or it\u2019s got this sponsor.

{"Title":"October 17, 2000 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Gore-Bush Presidential Debate","Date":971740800000,"Participants":"Gore-Bush","Moderators":"MODERATOR","Speaker":"BUSH","Text":"Well, that\u2019s a great question. I think one of the problems we have, particularly for seniors, is there is no prescription drug coverage in Medicare. And therefore, when they have to try to purchase drugs they do so on their own, there\u2019s no kind of collective bargaining, no power of purchasing among seniors. So I think step one to make sure prescription drugs is more affordable for seniors, and those are the folks who really rely upon prescription drugs a lot these days, is to reform the Medicare system, is to have prescription drugs as an integral part of Medicare once and for all. The problem we have today is like the patient\u2019s bill of rights, particularly with health care, there\u2019s a lot of bickering in Washington, D.C. It\u2019s kind of like a political issue as opposed to a people issue. So what I want to do is I want to call upon Republicans and Democrats to forget all the arguing and finger pointing, and come together and take care of our seniors\u2019 prescription drug program, that says we\u2019ll pay for the poor seniors, we\u2019ll help all seniors with prescription drugs. In the meantime, I think it\u2019s important to have what\u2019s called Immediate Helping Hand, which is direct money to states so that seniors, poor seniors, don\u2019t have to choose between food and medicine. That\u2019s part of an overall overhaul. The purchasing powers. And I\u2019m against price controls. I think price controls would hurt our ability to continue important research and development. Drug therapies are replacing a lot of medicines as we used to know it. One of the most important things is to continue the research and development component. And so I\u2019m against price controls. Expediting drugs through the FDA makes sense, of course. Allowing the new bill that was passed in the Congress made sense to allow for, you know, drugs that were sold overseas to come back and other countries to come back into the United States. That makes sense. But the best thing to do is to reform Medicare."}

Now look, if you want someone who will spend a lot of words describing a whole convoluted process and then end up supporting legislation that is supported by the big drug companies, this is your man. If you want someone who will fight for you and who will fight for the middle-class families and working men and women, who are sick and tired of having their parents and grandparents pay higher prices for prescription drugs than anybody else, then I want to fight for you. And you asked a great question because it\u2019s not only seniors. Listen, for 24 years I have never been afraid to take on the big drug companies. They do some great things. They discover great new cures and that\u2019s great. We want them to continue that. But they are now spending more money on advertising and promotion. You see all these ads? Than they are on research and development. And they are trying artificially extend the monopoly patent protection so they can keep charging these very high prices. I want to streamline the approval of the competing generic drugs and the new kinds of treatments that can compete with them so we bring the price down for everybody. Now, briefly, let me tell you how my prescription drug plan works. The governor talked about Medicare. I propose a real prescription drug benefit under Medicare for all seniors, all seniors, and here\u2019s how it works. You pick your own doctor, and nobody can take that away from you. The doctor chooses the prescription that you need and nobody can overrule your doctor. You go to your own pharmacy and then Medicare pays half the price. If you\u2019re poor, they pay all of it. If you have extraordinarily high cost, then they pay all over $4,000 out-of-pocket. And I\u2019ll bring new competition to bring the price down. And if you pass the big drug companies\u2019 bill, nothing will happen."}

We\u2019ve spent 65 years now on the development of a hybrid system, partly private, partly public, and 85% of our people have health insurance, 15% don\u2019t. That adds up to 44 million people. That is a national outrage. We have got to get health coverage for those who do not have it and we\u2019ve got to improve the quality for those who do with a patient\u2019s bill of rights that\u2019s real and that works, the Dingle-Norwood bill, and we have got to fill in the gaps in coverage by finally bringing parity for the treatment of mental illness, because that\u2019s been left out. We have got to deal with long-term care. Now, here are the steps that I would take, first of all. I will make a commitment to bring health care coverage of high quality that is affordable to every single child in America within four years. And then we\u2019ll fill other gaps by covering the parents of those children when the family is poor or up to two and a half times the poverty rate. I want to give a tax credit for the purchase of individual health insurance plans. I want to give small business employers a tax credit, 25%, to encourage the providing of health insurance for the employees in small businesses. I want to give seniors who are, well, the near elderly, I don\u2019t like that term because I am just about in that category, but those 55 to 65 ought to be able to buy into Medicare for premiums that are reasonable and fair and significantly below what they have to get now. Now, we have a big difference on this. And you need to know the record here. Under Governor Bush, Texas has sunk to be 50th out of 50 in health care \u2014 in health insurance for their citizens. Last week he said that they were spending 3.7 billion dollars, or 4.7 billion dollars on this."}

I don\u2019t want the federal government making decisions for consumers or for providers. I remember what the administration tried to do in 1993. They tried to have a national health care plan. And fortunately, it failed. I trust people, I don\u2019t trust the federal government. It\u2019s going to be one of the themes you hear tonight. I don\u2019t want the federal government making decisions on behalf of everybody. There is an issue with the uninsured, there sure is. And we have uninsured people in my state. Ours is a big state, a fast-growing state. We share a common border with another nation. But we\u2019re providing health care for our people. One thing about insurance, that\u2019s a Washington term. The question is, are people getting health care, and we have a strong safety net, and there needs to be a safety net in America. There needs to be more community health clinics where the poor can go get health care. We need a program for the uninsured. They\u2019ve been talking about it in Washington, D.C. The number of uninsured has now gone up for the past seven years. We need a $2,000 credit, rebate for people, working people that don\u2019t have insurance, they can get in the marketplace and start purchasing insurance. We need to have \u2014 allow small businesses to write insurance across jurisdictional lines so small business can afford health care, small restaurants can afford health care. So health care needs to be affordable and available. We have to trust people to make decisions with their lives. In the Medicare reform I talk about it says if you are a senior, you can stay in Medicare if you like it, and that\u2019s fine, but we\u2019re going to give you other choices to choose if you want to do so, just like they do the federal employees. The people that work in Washington, D.C. for the U.S. Congress or the United States senate. Get a variety of choices to make in their lives. And that\u2019s what we ought to do for all people in America."}

I wish I knew the law because I would darn sure sign it. I wish I knew the law that said all of us would be good parents. One of the things the next president must do is to remind people that if we are going to have a responsible period in America, that each of us must love our children with all our heart and all our soul. I happened to believe strong accountability encourages parental involvement, though. I think when you measure and post results on the Internet or in the town newspapers, most parents say wait a minute, my child\u2019s school isn\u2019t doing what I want it to do and, therefore, become involved in education. I recognize there are some who just don\u2019t seem to care. But there are a lot of parents who feel like everything is going well in their child\u2019s school, and all of a sudden they wake up and realize that wait a minute, standards aren\u2019t being met. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so strong for accountability. I believe we ought to measure a lot, three, four, five, six, seven, eighth grade. We do so in my state of Texas. One of the good things we\u2019ve gone in Texas is we have strong accountability because you can\u2019t cure unless you know. You can\u2019t solve a problem unless you diagnose it. I strongly believe that one of the best things to encourage parental involvement also is to know that the classrooms will be safe and secure. That\u2019s why I support a teacher liability act at the federal level, that says if a teacher or principal upholds reasonable standards of classroom discipline they can\u2019t be sued. They can\u2019t be sued. I think parents will be more involved with education when they know their children\u2019s classrooms are safe and secure as well. I also believe that we need to say to people that if you cannot meet standards, there has to be a consequence. Instead of just comes the soft bigotry of low expectations, that there has to be a consequence. We can\u2019t continue to shuffle children through school. And one of the consequences to allow parents to have different choices."}
{"Title":"October 17, 2000 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Gore-Bush Presidential Debate","Date":971740800000,"Participants":"Gore-Bush","Moderators":"MODERATOR","Speaker":"GORE","Text":"We have huge difference between us on this question. I\u2019d like to start by telling you what my vision is. I see a day in the United States of America where all of our public schools are considered excellent, world class. Where there are no failing schools, where the classrooms are small enough in size, number of students, so that the teacher can spend enough one-on-one time with each student. Now that means recruiting new teachers for the public schools. It means in my plan hiring bonuses to get 100,000 new teachers in the public schools within the next four years. It means also helping local school districts that sometimes find the parents of school age children outvoted on bond issues, to give them some help with interest-free bonding authority so that we can build new schools and modernize the classrooms. We need to give teachers the training and professional development that they need, including a paid time off to go visit the classroom of a master teacher to pick up some new skills. I want to give every middle-class family a $10,000 a year tax deduction for college tuition so that middle-class families will always be able to send their kids on to college. I want to work for universal free school because we know from all the studies that the youngsters learn, kids learn more in the first few years of life than any where else. Now, I said there was a contrast. Governor Bush is for vouchers, and in his plan he proposes to drain more money, more taxpayer money out of the public schools for private school vouchers than all of the money that he proposes in his entire budget for public schools themselves. And only one in 20 students would be eligible for these vouchers, and they wouldn\u2019t even pay the full tuition to private school. I think that\u2019s a mistake. I don\u2019t think we should give up on the private schools and leave kids trapped in failing schools. I think we \u2014 I think we should make it the number one priority to make our schools the best in the world, all of them."}
{"Title":"October 17, 2000 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Gore-Bush Presidential Debate","Date":971740800000,"Participants":"Gore-Bush","Moderators":"MODERATOR","Speaker":"BUSH","Text":"Yeah, I appreciate that. I think any time we end with one of these attacks, it\u2019s appropriate to respond. Here\u2019s what I think. First of all, vouchers are up to states. If you want to do a voucher program in Missouri, fine. I strongly believe in local control of schools. I\u2019m a governor of state and I don\u2019t like it when the federal government tells us what to do. I believe in local control of schools. But here\u2019s what I said. I\u2019ve said to the extent we spend federal money on disadvantaged children, we want the schools to show us whether or not the children are learning. What\u2019s unreasonable about that? We expect there to be standards met and we expect there to be measurement. And if we find success we\u2019ll praise it. But when we find children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach, instead of saying oh, this is okay in America just to shuffle poor kids through schools, there has to be a consequence. And the consequence is that federal portion or federal money will go to the parent, so the parent can go to a tutoring program or another public school or another private school. You see, there has to be a consequence. We\u2019ve got a society that says hey, the status quo is fine, just move them through. And guess who suffers."}

Described under your plan, Governor Bush, states would be required to pay vouchers to students to match the vouchers so that the federal government would put up. Now, you\u2019re \u2014 and the way it would happen is that under his plan, if a school was designated as failing, the kids would be trapped there for another three years and then some of them would get federal vouchers and the state would be forced to match those, that money. Under my plan, if a school is failing, we work with the states to give them the authority and the resources to close down that school and reopen it right away with a new principal, a new faculty, a turn-around team of specialists who know what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s based on the plan of Governor Jim Hunt in North Carolina, and it works great."}

I mentioned before that the local communities are having a harder time passing bond issues. Traditionally, if you\u2019ve been involved in a campaign like that, you know that the parents with kids in school are the ones that turn out and vote. It\u2019s ironic that there are now \u2014 there is now a smaller percentage of the voters made up of parents with children than ever in American history because of the aging of our population, but at the same time we\u2019ve got the largest generation of students in public schools ever. More than 90% of America\u2019s children go to public schools. And it\u2019s the largest number ever this year and they\u2019ll break the record next year and every year for ten years running. We\u2019ve got to do something about this. And local \u2014 it\u2019s not enough to leave it up to the local school districts. They\u2019re not able to do it and our future depends upon it. Look, we\u2019re in an information age. Our economic future depends upon whether or not our children are going to get the kind of education that lets them go on to college. And again, I want to make it possible for all middle-class families to send their kids to college and more Pell grants for those who are in the lower income groups also, and then I want to make sure that we have job training on top of that and lifelong learning, but it all starts with the public school teachers. My proposal gives $10,000 hiring bonuses for those teachers who are \u2014 who get certified to teach in the areas where they\u2019re most needed. Now, accountability, we basically agree on accountability. My plan requires testing of all students. It also requires something that Governor Bush\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t. It requires testing of all new teachers, including in the subjects that they teach. We have to start treating teachers like the professionals that they are, and give them the respect and the kind of quality of life that will draw more people into teaching because we need a lot more teachers."}

And there\u2019s just not going to be enough money. I have been a governor of a big state, I have made education my number one priority. That\u2019s what governors ought to do. They ought to say this is the most important thing we do as a state. The federal government puts about 6% of the money up. They put about, you know, 60% of the strings where you have to fill out the paperwork. I don\u2019t know if you have to be a paperwork filler-outer, but most of it\u2019s because of the federal government. What I want to do is to send flexibility and authority to the local folks so you can choose what to do with the money. One size does not fit all. I worry about federalizing education if I were you. I believe strongly that the federal government can help, we need to fund Headstart. We need to have accountability. The Vice President\u2019s plan does not have annual accountability, third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade. We need to demand on results. I believe strongly in a teacher protection act like I mentioned. I hear from teachers all the time about the lawsuits and the threats, respect in the classroom. Part of it\u2019s because you can\u2019t \u2014 you can\u2019t control the classroom. You can\u2019t have a consequence for somebody without fear of getting sued under federal law. So I\u2019m going to ask the Congress to pass a teacher protection act. So I believe in flexibility, I believe in a national reading initiative for local districts to access with K through 2 diagnostic testing, curriculum that works, phonics works, by the way, it needs to be a part of our curriculum. There needs to be flexibility for teacher training and teacher hiring with federal money. The federal government can be a part, but don\u2019t fall prey to all this stuff about money here and money there because education is really funded at the local level. 94% comes from the local level."}

Now under my plan we\u2019ll balance the budget every year. I\u2019m not just saying this. I\u2019m not just talking. I have helped to balance the budget for the first time in 30 years, paid down the debt. And under my plan, in four years, as the percentage of our gross domestic product, federal spending will be the smallest that it has been in 50 years. One reason is, you know, the third biggest spending item in our budget is interest on the national debt? We get nothing for it. We keep the good faith and credit of the United States. I will pay down the debt every single year until it is eliminated early in the next decade. That gets rid of the third biggest intrusion of the federal government in our economy. Now, because the governor has all this money for a tax cut mostly to the wealthy, there is no money left over, so schools get testing and lawsuit reform and not much else."}

And therefore, wealthy people are going to get it. But the top 1% will end up paying one-third of the taxes in America and they get one-fifth of the benefits. And that\u2019s because we structured the plan so that six million additional American families pay no taxes. If you\u2019re a family of four making $50,000 in Missouri, you get a 50% cut in your federal income taxes. What I\u2019ve done is set priorities and funded them. And there\u2019s extra money.

And first let me say that our nation now needs to speak with one voice during this time, and I applaud the president for working hard to diffuse tensions. Our nation needs to be credible and strong. When we say we\u2019re somebody\u2019s friend, everybody has got to believe it. Israel is our friend and we\u2019ll stand by Israel. We need to reach out to moderate Arab nations as well to build coalitions to keep the peace. I also need \u2014 the next leader needs to be patient. We can\u2019t put the Middle East peace process on our timetable. It\u2019s got to be on the timetable of the people that we\u2019re trying to bring to the peace table. We can\u2019t dictate the terms of peace, which means that you have to be steady. You can\u2019t worry about polls or focus groups. You\u2019ve got to have a clear vision. That\u2019s what a leader does. A leader also understands that the United States must be strong to keep the peace. Saddam Hussein still is a threat in the Middle East. Our coalition against Saddam is unraveling. Sanctions are loosened. The man who may be developing weapons of mass destruction, we don\u2019t know because inspectors aren\u2019t in. So to answer your question, it requires a clear vision, a willingness to stand by our friends, and the credibility for people both friend and foe to understand when America says something, we mean it."}

Right now our military is the strongest in the entire history of the world. I will \u2014 I pledge to you I will do whatever is necessary to make sure that it stays that way. Now, what can I bring to that challenge? When I was a young man, my father was a senator opposed to the Vietnam War. When I graduated from college, there were plenty of fancy ways to get out of going and being a part of that. I went and I volunteered, and I went to Vietnam. I didn\u2019t do the most or run the greatest risk by a long shot, but I learned what it was like to be an enlisted man in the United States Army. In the Congress, in the House of Representatives, I served on the House Intelligence Committee and I worked hard to learn the subject of nuclear arms control and how we can diffuse these tensions and deal with non-proliferation and deal with the problems of terrorism and these new weapons of mass destruction. Look, we\u2019re gonna face some serious new challenges in the next four years. I\u2019ve worked on that long and hard. When I went to the United States Senate, I asked for an assignment to the Armed Services Committee. And while I was there I worked on a bipartisan basis, as I did in the House, I worked with former President Reagan on the modernization of our strategic weaponry. In the Senate I was one of only ten Democrats, along with Senator Joe Lieberman, to support Governor Bush\u2019s dad in the Persian Gulf War Resolution. And for the last eight years I\u2019ve served on the National Security Council. Can I say just one other thing here?"}

Just to finish briefly, I started to say that for the last eight years I\u2019ve been on the National Security Council. Last week I broke up \u2014 I suspended campaigning for two days, or parts of two days, to go back and participate in the meetings that charted the President\u2019s summit meeting that he just returned from earlier today. And our team of \u2014 our country\u2019s team over there did a great job. It\u2019s a difficult situation. The United States has to be strong in order to make sure that we can help promote peace and security and stability. And that means keeping our military strong. Now, I said earlier that we are the strongest military, but we need to continue improving readiness and making sure that our military personnel are adequately paid and that the combination of their pay and their benefits and their retirement as veterans is comparable to the stiff competition that\u2019s coming in this strong economy from the private sector. And I have supported the largest pay raise in many a year, and I support another one now. I also support modernization of our strategic and tactical weaponry. The governor has proposed skipping a generation of technology. I think that would be a mistake, because I think one of the ways we\u2019ve been able to be so successful in Kosovo and Bosnia and Haiti and in other places is by having the technological edge. You know, we won that conflict in Kosovo without losing a single human life in combat, a single American life in combat. Now, readiness. The trends before we \u2014 before I got my current job were on the decline, the number of divisions were reduced. I argued that we should reverse that trend and take it back up. And I\u2019m happy to tell you that we have. Now, in my budget for the next ten years I propose $100 billion for this purpose. The governor proposes $45 billion. I propose more than twice as much because I think it\u2019s needed."}

It must be in the national interests, must be in our vital interests whether we ever send troops. The mission must be clear. Soldiers must understand why we\u2019re going. The force must be strong enough so that the mission can be accomplished. And the exit strategy needs to be well-defined. I\u2019m concerned that we\u2019re overdeployed around the world. See, I think the mission has somewhat become fuzzy. Should I be fortunate enough to earn your confidence, the mission of the United States military will be to be prepared and ready to fight and win war. And therefore prevent war from happening in the first place. There may be some moments when we use our troops as peacekeepers, but not often. The Vice President mentioned my view of long-term for the military. I want to make sure the equipment for our military is the best it can possibly be, of course. But we have an opportunity \u2014 we have an opportunity to use our research and development capacities, the great technology of the United States, to make our military lighter, harder to find, more lethal. We have an opportunity, really, if you think about it, if we\u2019re smart and have got a strategic vision and a leader who understands strategic planning, to make sure that we change the terms of the battlefield of the future so we can keep the peace. This is a peaceful nation, and I intend to keep the peace. Spending money is one thing. But spending money without a strategic plan can oftentimes be wasted. First thing I\u2019m going to do is ask the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan so we are making sure we\u2019re not spending our money on political projects, but on projects to make sure our soldiers are well-paid, well-housed, and have the best equipment in the world."}

I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be allowed to protect themselves and their families. I believe that we ought to keep guns out of the hands of people that shouldn\u2019t have them. That\u2019s why I\u2019m for instant background checks at gun shows, I\u2019m for trigger locks, I think that makes sense. Matter of fact, we distributed free trigger locks in the State of Texas so that people can get them and put them on their guns to make their guns more safe. I think we ought to raise the age at which juveniles can have a gun. But I also believe strongly that we need to enforce laws on the books that the best way to make sure that we keep our society safe and secure is to hold people accountable for breaking the law. If we catch somebody illegally selling a gun, there needs to be a consequence. If we keep somebody \u2014 you know, illegally using a gun, there needs to be a consequence. Enforcement of law, and the federal government can help. There is a great program called Project Exile in Richmond, Virginia, where we focused federal taxpayers\u2019 money and federal prosecutors and went after people who were illegally using guns. To me that\u2019s how you make society the safest it can be. And so, yeah, sometimes I agree with some of these groups in Washington and sometimes I don\u2019t. I\u2019m a pretty independent thinker.

I think that some common sense gun safety measures are certainly needed with the flood of cheap handguns that have sometimes been working their way into the hands of the wrong people. But all of my proposals are focused on that problem, gun safety. None of my proposals would have any effect on hunters, or sportsmen, or people who use rifles. They\u2019re aimed at the real problem. Let\u2019s make our schools safe, let\u2019s make our neighborhoods safe. Let\u2019s have a three-day waiting period, cooling off, so we can have a background check to make sure that criminals and people who really shouldn\u2019t have guns don\u2019t get them. But I would like to use my remaining time on this exchange, Jim, to respond to an exchange that took place just a moment ago. Because a couple of times the governor has said that I am for a bigger government. Governor, I\u2019m not. And let me tell you what the record shows. For the last eight years I have had the challenge of running the streamlining program called Reinventing Government. And if there are any federal employees in this group, you know what that means. The federal government has been reduced in size by more than 300,000 people. And it\u2019s now the smallest number that we have had since the \u2014 the smallest in size since John Kennedy\u2019s administration. During the last five years, Texas\u2019s government has gone up in size. Federal government has gone down, Texas\u2019s government has gone up. Now, my plan for the future, I see a time when we have smaller, smarter government where you don\u2019t have to wait in line because you can get services online cheaper, better, faster. We can do that."}

But that\u2019s the good news. You know what the bad news is that follows on that. The prices are low. In the last several years, the so-called Freedom To Farm Law has, in my view, been mostly a failure. I want to change many of its provisions. Now, many here who are not involved in farming don\u2019t \u2014 won\u2019t follow this, so just forgive me. Because the 2% of the country that is involved in farming is important because the rest of us wouldn\u2019t eat except for them. And you guys have been having a hard time, and I want to fight for you. I want to change those provisions. I want to restore a meaningful safety net. And I think that you pointed the way in your comments, because when you say there are multiple things accomplished by farmers, you\u2019re specifically including conservation and protection of the environment. And yes, farmers are the first environmentalists. And when they decide not to plow a field that is vulnerable to soil erosion, that may cost them a little money, but it helps the environment. I think that we ought to have an expanded conservation reserve program. And I think that the environmental benefits that come from sound management of the land ought to represent a new way for farmers to get some income that will enable them \u2014 enable you to make sensible choices in crop rotation, and when you leave the land fallow and the rest. Now, I\u2019ll go beyond that and say I think we need much more focus on rural economic development programs. I see a time when the Internet-based activities are more available in the rural areas and where the extra source of income that farm families used to have from shoe factories is replaced by an extra source of income from working in the information economy. So we need to do a lot of things, but we ought to start with a better safety net."}

I\u2019m for getting rid of the death tax, completely getting rid of the death tax. One reason family farmers are forced to sell early is because of the death tax. This is a bad tax. The President shouldn\u2019t have vetoed that bill. It\u2019s a tax that taxes people twice. It penalizes the family farmer. So should I be fortunate enough to earn your vote, I also understand \u2014 I want to open up markets, but I also understand that farming is a part of our national security.

So 80% \u2014 now the problem with completely eliminating it goes back to the wealthiest 1%. The amount of money that has to be raised in taxes for middle-class families to make up for completely eliminating that on the very wealthiest, the billionaires, that would be an extra heavy burden on middle-class families.

We can work with the entertainment industry to provide family hour. We can have filters on Internets where public money is spent. There ought to be filters in public libraries and filters in public schools so if kids get on the Internet, there is not going to be pornography or violence coming in. I think we ought to have character education in our schools. I know that doesn\u2019t directly talk about Hollywood, but it does reinforce the values you\u2019re teaching. Greatly expand character education funding so that public schools will teach children values, values which have stood the test of time. There\u2019s afterschool money available. I think that afterschool money ought to be available for faith-based programs and charitable programs that exist because somebody has heard the call to love a neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself. That will help reinforce the values that parents teach at home as well. Ours is a great land, and one of the reasons why is because we\u2019re free. And so I don\u2019t support censorship. But I do believe that we ought to talk plainly to the Hollywood moguls and people who produce this stuff and explain the consequences. I think we need to have rating systems that are clear.

She and her husband made us grandparents almost a year-and-a-half ago, and yet if she\u2019ll forgive me, when she was little, she brought a record home that had some awful lyrics in it and Tipper hit the ceiling.

I\u2019ve been involved myself in negotiating and helping to move along the negotiations with the Internet service providers to get a parents\u2019 protection page every time 95% of the pages come up.

You know, some parents are worried about those filters, that you will have to ask your kids how to put them on there. But if you can check up on them, that\u2019s real power.

And I want to tell you what I tell them. Sometimes people who are very idealistic and have great dreams, as young people do, are apt to stay at arm\u2019s length from the political process because they think their good hearts might be brittle, and if they invest their hopes and allow themselves to believe, then they\u2019re gonna be let down and disappointed.

There\u2019s a lot of young folks saying, you know, why do I want to be involved with this mess?

Quotas tend to pit one group of people against another. Quotas are bad for America. It\u2019s not the way America is all about. But policies that give people a helping hand so they can help themselves. For example, in our State of Texas I worked with the legislature, both Republicans and Democrats, to pass a law that said if you come in the top 10% of your high school class, you\u2019re automatically admitted to one of our higher institutions of learning, college. And as a result, our universities are now more diverse. It was a smart thing to do. What I called it, I labeled it affirmative access. I think the contracting business in government can help. Not with quotas, but help meet a goal of ownership of small businesses, for example. The contracts need to be smaller, the agencies need to be \u2014 need to recruit and to work hard to find people to bid on the state contracts. I think we can do that in a way that represents what America is all about, which is equal opportunity and an opportunity for people to realize their potential.

It\u2019s all too easy for somebody in the majority in the population to say oh, we\u2019re just all the same, without an understanding of the different life experience that you\u2019ve had, that others have had. Once you have that understanding and mutual respect, then we can transcend the differences and embrace the highest common denominator of the American spirit. I don\u2019t know what affirmative access means. I do know what affirmative action means. I know the governor is against it, and I know that I\u2019m for it. I know what a hate crime statute pending at the national level is all about in the aftermath of James Byrd\u2019s death. I\u2019m for that proposed law, the governor is against it. I know what it means to have a commitment to diversity. I am part of an administration that has the finest record on diversity. And incidentally, an excellent \u2014 I mean, I think our success over the last eight years has not been in spite of diversity but because of it. Because we\u2019re able to draw on the wisdom and experience from different parts of the society that hadn\u2019t been tapped in the same way before. And incidentally, Mel Carnahan in Missouri had the finest record on diversity in any governor in the entire history of the State of Missouri. And I want to honor that among his other achievements here. Now, I just believe that what we have to do is enforce the civil rights laws. I\u2019m against quotas. This is, with all due respect, Governor, that\u2019s a red herring. Affirmative action isn\u2019t quotas. I\u2019m against quotas, they\u2019re illegal. They\u2019re against the American way. Affirmative action means that you take extra steps to acknowledge the history of discrimination and injustice and prejudice and bring all people into the American dream because it helps everybody, not just those who are directly benefitting."}

If you make less than $30,000 a year and you put $500 in a savings account, the federal government will match it with $1500. If you make more than $60,000 and up to 100 you\u2019ll still get a match, but not as generous. You\u2019ll get an access to life-long learning and education, help with tuition if you want to get a new skill or training. If you want to purchase health insurance, you will get help with that. If you want to participate in some of the dynamic changes that are going on in our country, you will get specific help in doing that.

You\u2019re going to get a tax relief in my plan. You\u2019re not going to be targeted in or targeted out. Everybody that pays taxes is going to get tax relief. If you take care of an elderly in your home, you\u2019re going to get the personal exemption increased. I think also what you need to think about is not the immediate, but what about Medicare? You get a plan that will include prescription drugs, a plan that will give you options. Now, I hope people understand that Medicare today is important, but it doesn\u2019t keep up with the new medicines. If you\u2019re a Medicare person, on Medicare, you don\u2019t get the new procedures. You\u2019re stuck in a time warp in many ways. So it will be a modern Medicare system that trusts you to make a variety of options for you. You\u2019re going to live in a peaceful world. It will be a world of peace because we\u2019re going to have a clear sight of foreign policy based upon a strong military and a mission that stands by our friends. A mission that doesn\u2019t try to be all things to all people. A judicious use of the military which will help keep the peace. You\u2019ll live in a world, hopefully, that is more educated so it\u2019s less likely you\u2019ll be harmed in your neighborhood. See, an educated child is one much more likely to be hopeful and optimistic. You\u2019ll be in a world in which fits into my philosophy. The harder you work, the more you can keep. It\u2019s the American way. Government shouldn\u2019t be a heavy hand. It\u2019s what the federal government does to you.

I said I did if administered fairly and justly. Because I believe it saves lives, Leo, I do. If it\u2019s administered swiftly, justly and fairly, it saves lives. One of the things that happens when you\u2019re a governor, at least oftentimes you have to make tough decisions. You can\u2019t let public persuasion sway you, because the job is to enforce the law. And that\u2019s what I did, sir. There have been some tough cases come across my desk. Some of the hardest moments since I\u2019ve been the governor of the State of Texas is to deal with those cases. But my job is to ask two questions, sir. Is the person guilty of the crime? And did the person have full access to the courts of law? And I can tell you looking at you right now, in all cases those answers were affirmative. I\u2019m not proud of any record. I\u2019m proud of the fact that violent crime is down in the State of Texas. I\u2019m proud of the fact that we hold people accountable. But I\u2019m not proud of any record, sir, I\u2019m not."}

If the wrong guy is put to death, then that\u2019s a double tragedy. Not only has an innocent person been executed, but the real perpetrator of the crime has not been held accountable for it.

And, you know, we\u2019ve heard a lot about \u2014 from the governor about not much being done in the last eight years, as if the promises that I made eight years ago have not been kept. I think the record shows otherwise. We have gone from the biggest deficits eight years ago to the biggest surpluses in history today. Instead of high unemployment, we now have the lowest African-American unemployment, the lowest Latino unemployment ever measured. 22 million new jobs, very low unemployment nationally. Instead of ballooning the debt and multiplying it four times over, we have seen the debt actually begun to be paid down. Here are some promises that I\u2019ll make to you now. I will balance the budget every year. I will pay down the debt every year. I will give middle-class Americans tax cuts, meaningful ones. And I will invest in education, health care, protecting the environment and retirement security. We both made promises in this campaign. I promise you I will keep mine. Let me tell you about one of the governor\u2019s. He has promised a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund for young working adults to invest and save on their own. But he\u2019s promised seniors that their Social Security benefits will not be cut, and he\u2019s promised the same trillion dollars to them. So this is a show me state.

(LAUGHTER) I \u2014 there\u2019s an old high school debating trick, which is to answer something and then attack your opponent at the end. You asked about promises. You were promised that Medicare would be reformed, and that Social Security would be reformed. You were promised a middle-class tax cut in 1992. It didn\u2019t happen. There\u2019s too much bitterness in Washington. There\u2019s too much wrangling. It\u2019s time to have a fresh start. One of the reasons I was successful as the governor of Texas is because I didn\u2019t try to be all things to all people. When I campaigned in a race, a lot of folks didn\u2019t think I could win including, by the way, my mother. (LAUGHTER) I said I\u2019d do four things; tort reform, education reform, welfare reform and juvenile justice reform. And I won. And I had the will of the people in my state behind me. And then I brought folks together to get it done. And that\u2019s what we need, I think, in this election. To me that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. I\u2019m sure your 6th grade kids are listening and saying, these guys will say anything to get elected. But there\u2019s a record, and that\u2019s what I hope people look at. One of my promises is going to be Social Security reform, and you bet, we need to take a trillion dollars out of that $2.4 trillion surplus. Now remember, Social Security revenue exceeds expenses up until 2015. People are going to get paid. But if you\u2019re a younger worker, if you\u2019re younger, you better hope this country thinks differently, otherwise you\u2019re gonna be faced with huge payroll taxes or reduced benefits. And you bet we\u2019re gonna take a trillion dollars of your own money and let you invest it under safe guidelines so you get a better rate of return on the money than the paltry 2% that the federal government gets for you today. That\u2019s one of my promises. But it\u2019s gonna require people to bring both Republicans and Democrats together to get it done. That\u2019s what it requires. There was a chance to get this done. It was a bipartisan approach, but it\u2019s been rejected. I\u2019m going to bring them together."}

If you\u2019re in your mid-40\u2019s under the governor\u2019s plan, Social Security will be bankrupt by the time you retire, if he takes it out of the Social Security Trust Fund. Under my plan it will be \u2014 its solvency will be extended until you\u2019re 100. Now that is the difference. And the governor may not want to answer that question, he may want to call it a high school debating trick, but let me tell you this. This election is not about debating tricks, it is about your future. The reason Social Security \u2014 he says it gets 2%. You know, it\u2019s not a bank account that just pays back money that\u2019s invested. It is also used to give your mothers and fathers the Social Security checks that they live on.

Nine times I have raised my hand to take an oath to the Constitution, and I have never violated that oath. I have not spent the last quarter century in pursuit of personal wealth. I have spent the last quarter century fighting for middle-class working men and women in the United States of America.

If you want somebody who is willing to fight for you, I am asking for your support and your vote and, yes, your confidence and your willingness to believe that we can do the right thing in America, and be the better for it. We\u2019ve made some progress during the last eight years. We have seen the strongest economy in the history of the United States. Lower crime rates for eight years in a row.

It\u2019s an agenda that says we\u2019re going to reform Medicare to make sure seniors have got prescription drugs and to give seniors different options from which they can choose. It\u2019s an agenda that says we\u2019re listen to the young voices in Social Security and say we\u2019re going to think differently about making sure we have a system, but also fulfill the promise to the seniors in America. A promise made will be a promise kept should I be fortunate enough to become your president. I want to have the military keeping the peace. I want to make sure the public school system in America keeps its promise so not one child is left behind. After setting priorities, I want to give some of your money back.

Let\u2019s keep it going. We cut the deficit by 60 percent. Now, let\u2019s balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans. Now let\u2019s pass the tax cuts for education and child rearing, help with medical emergencies, and buying a home. We passed family and medical leave. Now let\u2019s expand it so more people can succeed as parents and in the work force. We passed 100,000 police, the assault weapons ban, the Brady Bill.

We reduced more regulations, eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors. But I have worked hard for things like the Family and Medical Leave Law, the Brady Bill, the assault weapons ban, the program to put 100,000 police on the street. All of these are programs that Senator Dole opposed that I supported, because I felt they were a legitimate effort to help people make the most of their own lives. I\u2019ve worked hard to help families impart values to their own children. I supported the V-chip so that parents would be able to control what their kids watch on television when they\u2019re young, along with the ratings systems for television and educational television. I supported strong action against the tobacco companies to stop the marketing, advertising, and sale of tobacco to young people. I supported a big increase in the safe and drug-free schools program.

A tax increase, a tax on everybody in America. Not just the rich. If you made 25,000 as the original proposal, you got your Social Security taxes increased. We had a BTU tax we turned into a $35 million gas tax, a $265 billion tax increase. I guess I rely more on the individual. I carry a little card in my pocket called the Tenth Amendment.

Men\u2019s wages haven\u2019t gone up, gone down. So we have stagnation. We have the highest foreign debt in history. And it seems to me that if you take a look, are you better off? Well, I guess some may be better off. Saddam Hussein is probably better off than he was four years ago. Renee Proval (ph) is probably better off than he was four years ago. But are the American people? They\u2019re working harder and higher and harder paying more taxes. For the first time in history, you pay about 40 percent of what you earn. More than you spend for food, clothing and shelter combined for taxes under this administration. So some may be better off. They talk about family income being up. That\u2019s not true in Connecticut, family income is down. And it\u2019s up in some cases because both parents are working. One works for the family, and one works to pay taxes for the government. We\u2019re going to give them tax cuts so they can spend more time with their children, maybe even take a vacation. That\u2019s what America is all about."}

We have ten and a half million more jobs, a faster job growth rate than under any Republican administration since the 1920s. Wages are goings up for the first time in a decade. We have record numbers of new small businesses. We have the biggest drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 years. All groups of people are growing. We had the biggest drop in income inequality in 27 years in 1995. The average family\u2019s income has gone up over $1600 just since our economic plan passed. So I think it\u2019s clear that we\u2019re better off than we were four years ago. Now we need to focus on what do we need to do to be better off still. How can we help people as we are to get their retirements when they work for small businesses, to be able to afford health insurance, to be able to educate their children. That\u2019s what I want to focus on. But we are clearly better off than we were four years ago, as Senator Dole acknowledged this year."}

But in any event, I think we just look at the facts. We ask the people that are viewing tonight, are you better off than you were four years ago. It\u2019s not whether we\u2019re better off, it\u2019s whether they\u2019re better off. Are you working harder to put food on the table, feed your children. Are your children getting a better education. Drug use has doubled the past 44 months all across America. Crime has gone down but it\u2019s because the mayors like Rudy Giuliani where one third of the drop happened in one city, New York City. So, yes, some may be better off. But of the people listening tonight, the working families who will benefit from economic packages, they\u2019ll be better off when Bob Dole is president and Jack Kemp is vice president."}

Let\u2019s look at the position. First of all, remember that in this campaign season, since Senator Dole\u2019s been a candidate, he has bragged about the fact that he voted against Medicare in the beginning, in 1965, one of only 12 members. He said he did the right thing then, he knew it wouldn\u2019t work at the time. That\u2019s what he said. Then his budget that he passed along with Speaker Gingrich cut Medicare $270 billion, more than was necessary to repair the Medicare trust fund. It would have charged seniors more for out-of-pocket costs as well as more in premiums because doctors could have charged them more. The American Medical, Hospital Association, the Nurses Association, the Catholic Hospital Association all said hundreds of hospitals could close and people would be hurt badly under the Dole-Gingrich Medicare plan that I vetoed. And now with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Senator Dole\u2019s, even his own friends, his campaign co-chair, Senator D\u2019Amato, says that they can\u2019t possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well, according to him. Now, my balanced budget plan adds ten years to the life of the Medicare trust fund, ten years. And we\u2019ll have time to deal with the long-term problems of the baby boomers. But it was simply wrong to finance their last scheme to cut Medicare $270 billion to run the risk of it withering on the vine. We always had to reform it over the years, but we need somebody who believes it in to reform it."}

I thought it was a good program. But I\u2019ve supported Medicare ever since. In fact, I used to go home, my mother would tell me, Bob, all I\u2019ve got is my Social Security and my Medicare, don\u2019t cut it. I wouldn\u2019t violate anything my mother said. In fact, we had a conversation about our mothers one day, a very poignant conversation in the White House. I\u2019m concerned about healthcare. I\u2019ve had the best healthcare from government hospitals, Army hospitals and I know its importance, but we\u2019ve got to fix it. It\u2019s his trustees, the President\u2019s trustees, not mine, who says it\u2019s going to go broke. He doesn\u2019t fix it for ten years. We ought to appoint a commission, just as we did in Social Security in 1983, when we rescued Social Security, and I was proud to be on that commission, along with Claude Pepper, the champion of senior citizens from Florida. And we can do it again, if we take politics out of it. Stop scaring the seniors, Mr. President. You\u2019ve already spent $45 million scaring seniors and tearing me apart. I think it\u2019s time to have a truce."}

But it won\u2019t be possible to do, if his tax scheme passes because even his own campaign co-chair, Senator D\u2019Amato, says he\u2019ll have to cut Medicare even more than was cut in the bill that I vetoed. I vetoed that bill because it cut more Medicare and and basically ran the risk of breaking up the system. My balanced budget plan puts ten years on the Medicare. We ought to do that, then we can have a commission. But Senator Dole\u2019s plans are not good for the country."}

This is not a Wall Street tax cut. This is a family tax cut. This is a Main Street tax cut, 15 percent across \u2014 let\u2019s take a family making $30,000 a year, that\u2019s $1261. Now, maybe to some in this Bushnell Memorial that it\u2019s not a lot of money, but people watching tonight with a couple of kids, a working family, that\u2019s four or five months of day care, maybe a personal computer; it\u2019s may be three or four months of mortgage payments. This economic package is about families but it\u2019s a six-point package. First of all, it\u2019s a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution which President Clinton defeated. He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote the other way, but we lost by one vote. It\u2019s balancing a budget by the year 2002. It\u2019s a tax cut, cutting capital gains 50 percent. So you can go out and create more jobs and more opportunities. It\u2019s a state tax relief. It\u2019s a $500 per child tax credit. It\u2019s about litigation reforms. Now that the President gets millions of dollars from the trial lawyers, he probably doesn\u2019t like this provision. In fact, when I fell off the podium in Chico, before I lit the ground, hit the ground I had call on my cell phone from a trial lawyer saying I think we\u2019ve got a case here. And it\u2019s also regulatory reform. It\u2019s a good package, Mr. President. We\u2019d like to have your support."}

It\u2019s a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans, and small business loans. It\u2019s not good to raise the deficit. We worked too hard to lower it. It will actually raise taxes on nine million people and, in addition to that, it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year. So it sounds great, but our targeted tax cut for education, child rearing, healthcare and home buying, which is paid for in my balanced budget plan, something that he has not done, certified by the Congressional budget office, that\u2019s the right way to go."}

You also provide opportunity scholarships so low income parents will have the same choice that others have in sending their children to better schools.

The Senator mentioned the trial lawyers. In the case of the product liability bill, which they passed and I vetoed, I think that\u2019s what he\u2019s talking about, I actually wanted to sign that bill. And I told the people exactly what the Congress exactly what kind of bill I would sign. Now, a lot of the trial lawyers didn\u2019t want me to sign any bill at all, but I had thought we ought to do what we could to cut frivolous lawsuits, but they wouldn\u2019t make some of the changes that I thought should be made. Now, let me just give you an example. I had a person in the Oval Office who lost a child in a school bus accident where a drunk driver caused the accident directly, but there were problems with the school bus. The drunk driver had no money. Under the new bill, if I had signed it, a person like that could never have had any recovery. I thought that was wrong. So I gave four or five specific examples to the Congress and said, prove to me that these people could recover but we\u2019re going to eliminate frivolous lawsuits, I\u2019ll sign the bill. But generally I believe that a president has to be willing to do what he thinks is right. I\u2019ve done a lot of things that were controversial. My economic plan, my trade position, Bosnia, Haiti, taking on the NRA for the first time, taking on the tobacco companies for the first time. Sometimes you just have to do that because you know it\u2019s right for the country over the long run. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried to do and that\u2019s what I will continue to do as president."}

Well, I don\u2019t know in the case of the trial lawyers. I look at the trial lawyers, and when you\u2019re a few million short, you run out to Hollywood and pick up two to four million and organized labor comes to Washington, D.C. and puts 35 million into the pot. Now, if these aren\u2019t special interests, I\u2019ve got a lot to learn. I was there for a while before I left on June the 11th. The trial lawyers and I don\u2019t \u2014 you know, my wife\u2019s a lawyer. We\u2019re the only two lawyers in Washington that trust each other. But we\u2019re lawyers, I like lawyers.

You\u2019re putting a lot of business people out of business. Small businessmen and businesswomen who paid 70 percent of your ninteen , your$265 billion tax increase, the largest tax increase in the history of America. I said that one day and Pat Moynihan, a Democrat, say, no, he said, in the history of the world. So I modified it, the largest tax increase in the history of the world.

Let\u2019s be honest about it. That\u2019s why we need campaign finance reform. That\u2019s why I reach out to the Perot voters. We\u2019ve done about all, we are the reform party, the Republican Party. And the Perot voters that are looking for a home ought to take a look at the Republican record. Whatever it is, whatever the checklist was in \u201992, it\u2019s all done with campaign finance reform. I worked with Senator Mitchell, who played me, I guess, in the debate warmup. We tried six or eight years ago. He appointed three people, I appointed three people to get campaign finance reform. We couldn\u2019t get it done, because I wasn\u2019t enforceable. You\u2019ve suggested a commission, Newt Gingrich did, I suggested that at least four or five years ago. We have a commission on campaign finance reform. They send it to Congress, and we have to vote it up or down. That\u2019s how it works. We are never going to fix it by the parties, because Democrats want a better advantage for themselves, we want a better advantage as Republicans, and that\u2019s not how it\u2019s going to work. But I want to touch on this is tobacco thing. I know the President\u2019s been puffing a lot on that. But I want to go back to 1965. That was my first vote against tobacco companies when I said we ought to label cigarettes. And I\u2019ve had a consistent record ever since 1965. We passed a bill in 1992 that encouraged the states to adopt programs to stop kids from smoking. All 50 states did it. It took three and a half years. It wasn\u2019t until election year, Mr. President, that you ever thought about stopping smoking. What about drugs that have increased, doubled in the last 44 months? Cocaine is up 141 percent \u2014 marijuana, cocaine up 166 percent. It seems to me that you have a selective memory. You know, mine doesn\u2019t work that way. So I just want to try to correct it as we go along."}

But let me respond to what you said. I agree that too many incumbent politicians in Washington in both parties have consistently opposed campaign finance reform. That was certainly the case from the minute I got there. So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested \u2014 a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission. And I shook hands with him on it and I appointed my members, and the commission never met. And then Senator Dole\u2019s ardent supporters, Senator McCain, who\u2019s out there today, along with Senator Feingold, supported, sponsored a campaign finance reform proposal. I strongly supported it. And members of Senator Dole\u2019s own party in the Senate killed it. And he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill. So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have. And I hope we can finally get it in the next session of Congress, because we need it badly."}

I am. But let\u2019s look at the overall record. Overall in America cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years, casual drug use down 13 percent. The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it. Let me tell you what I tried to do about it. I appointed a four-star general who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country as our nation\u2019s drug czar. The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired. We submitted the biggest drug budget ever. We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border. We supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including, including the death penalty for drug kingpins. And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug-free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all those things were very important. Do I think that I bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still don\u2019t understand drugs are wrong, drugs can kill you. Even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them. I think we all do. And I hope we can do better. I don\u2019t think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I don\u2019t think Senator Dole supports using using drugs. I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn\u2019t dangerous and won\u2019t kill them and won\u2019t destroy their lives, get the message and change."}

You don\u2019t want to politicize drugs, but it\u2019s already politicized Medicare, go out and scare senior citizens and other vulnerable groups, veterans and people who get Pell Grants and things like this. I mean, you say we\u2019ve done all these bad things, which isn\u2019t the case. But it seems to me the record is clear. The record is pretty clear in Arkansas, when you were governor. Drug use doubled. You resisted the appointment of a drug czar there because you thought it might interfere with treatment. But here you cut the drug czar\u2019s office 83 percent. You cut interdiction substantially. I mean that\u2019s what, I want to stop it from coming across the border. And in my administration, we\u2019re going to train the National Guard to stop it from coming across the border. This is a invasion of drugs from all over the world. And we have a responsibility. You had a surgeon \u2014 or before General McCaffrey (ph) you had a lady who said we ought to consider legalizing drugs. Is that the kind of leadership we need? And I won\u2019t comment on other things that happened in your administration or your past about drugs.

But I\u2019ve got a better idea. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve worked on for 15 years. It\u2019s called the automated check or the instant check. It\u2019s being used in 17 states right now. States like Florida, Colorado, Virginia, and other states. You don\u2019t buy any gun. You don\u2019t get any gun. We\u2019ve got 20 million names on a computer in Washington, D.C. of people who should not have guns. We ought to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. And, there are eight other categories that should not have guns. I\u2019ve been working on this for a long, long time. You walk in, you put your little card in there. If it says tilt, you don\u2019t get any gun. You don\u2019t get a hand gun, you don\u2019t get a rifle, you don\u2019t get a shot gun, you get zippo. If we\u2019re going to protect American children and American families and people who live as prisoners in their own home, we\u2019ve got to stop guns from being dumped on the street. The administration says they support the instant check. They\u2019ve appropriated about $200 million, but only spent about $3 million to get it underway. In our administration, in my administration, we will expedite. This keeps up with technology. It keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have guns. That is the bottom line. And I believe it\u2019s a good idea, has strong bipartisan support. And perhaps that\u2019s another thing we can depoliticize. You talk about the Brady Bill. There has only been one prosecution under the Brady \u2014 only one under the assault weapon ban and only seven under the Brady Bill that you talk about all the time. And on the assault weapon ban, out of 17 weapons that were banned, only six banned now because eleven have been modified and are back on the street.

The Brady Bill has kept at least 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers from getting hand guns. Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill. He tried to keep it from coming to my desk. He didn\u2019t succeed and I signed it and I\u2019m glad I did. Then when we had the assault weapons ban in the Senate, Senator Dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the National Rifle Association didn\u2019t want the assault weapons ban, just like they didn\u2019t want the Brady Bill. But two years later nobody\u2019s lost their handguns. I mean, their rifles. We\u2019ve expanded the Brady Bill to cover people who beat up their spouses and their kids. And this is a safer country.

I\u2019m not going to worry about it anymore. Let\u2019s do something better. Let\u2019s stop, you know, playing the political game, Mr. President. Talking about this and this. You add all the states that\u2019ve used the instant check and how many weapons they keep, kept out of the hands of criminals. It would far surpass the numbers you mentioned. So in my view, if you want to be protected, you ought to vote for Bob Dole and we\u2019ll get the instant check passed and we\u2019ll keep guns out of the hands of criminals."}

Look at where we are today. The United States is still the indispensable nation in the aftermath of the Cold War and on the brink of the 21st Century. I have worked to support our country as the world\u2019s strongest force for peace and freedom, prosperity and security. We have done the following things - Number one, we\u2019ve managed the aftermath of the Cold War, supporting a big drop in nuclear weapons in Russia. The removal of Russian troops from the Baltics. The integration of Central and Eastern European democracies into a new partnership with NATO. And, I might add, with the democratic Russia. There are no nuclear missiles pointed at the children of the United States tonight and have not been in our administration for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age. We have worked hard for peace and freedom. When I took office, Haiti was governed by a dictator that had defied the United States. When I took office, the worst war in Europe was waging in Bosnia. Now there is a the democratically elected president in Haiti. Peace in Bosnia. We just had the election there. We\u2019ve made progress in Northern Ireland, in the Middle East. We\u2019ve also stood up to the new threats of terrorism. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, and we have worked hard to expand America\u2019s economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade with the largest new number of trade agreements in history And that\u2019s one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again."}

Again, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve supported the President on Bosnia, and I think we were told the troops would be out in a year. Now I understand it\u2019s been extended \u2019til some time next year. But, let\u2019s start with Somalia, where they dragged Americans through the streets, and where 18 Americans were killed one day, because they didn\u2019t have, they were pinned down for eight hours, the rangers. They didn\u2019t have the weapons, they didn\u2019t have the tanks. They asked for the tanks. They didn\u2019t get the tanks from this administration because we were nation building. It\u2019s called mission creep. We turn it over to the United Nations. The President didn\u2019t have much to do about it. You look at Haiti, where we spend about three billion dollars and we got an alarm call there about two weeks ago. You got to send down some more people, because the president\u2019s found out there are death squads on his on his, in his own property. So we need more protection from America. Bosnia, Northern Ireland. There\u2019s no ceasefire in Bosnia. I think there are still lot of problems in Bosnia. We agreed to train and arm the Muslims so they could defend themselves, the policy you had when you ran in 1992. We haven\u2019t done that. We\u2019re way behind, which means Americans can\u2019t come home. Americans shouldn\u2019t have gone there in the first place, had we let them defend themselves, as they have a right to do under Article 57 of the United Nations charter."}

I believe they did the best they could under the circumstances, and let\u2019s not forget that hundreds of thousands of lives were saved there. Secondly, in Haiti, political violence is much, much smaller than it was. Thirdly, in Bosnia it\u2019s a virtual miracle that there has been no return to war and at least there has now been an election. And institutions are beginning to function. In Northern Ireland, in the Middle East we are better off than we were four years ago. There will always be problems in this whole world. But if we\u2019re moving in the right direction and America is leading, we\u2019re better off."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":844560000000,"Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"DOLE","Text":"Well it, after World War I, we had, you know, a policy of disengagement. Then from World War I to World War II we had sort of a compulsory engagement policy. Now I think we have a selective engagement policy. We have to determine when our interests are involved, not the United Nations\u2019 interests. And many of the things the President talked about, he turned over to the United Nations. They decided. He\u2019s deployed more troops than any president in history around the world. It\u2019s cost us billions and billions of dollars for peace-keeping operations. Look these are facts. And it seems to me that when you make a decision, the decision is made by the President of the United States, by the Commander-in-Chief. He makes that decision when he commits young men or young women who are going to go round and defend our liberty and our freedom. That would be my position. Then I\u2019m going to have a top down review at the Pentagon, not a bottom up review. We all fight over how much money is there. I want a top down review to determine what our priorities are and what we should do in defense, and then follow that policy instead of this bottom up review with all the services fighting for the money. You know, the President said he was going to cut defense $60 billion, he cut defense $112 billion. Devastated states like California and others. And I think now we\u2019ve got a problem. We\u2019ve got to go back and look. It\u2019s just like you said in Texas one day, you know raised taxes too much, and you did, and you cut defense too much, Mr. President, and you did. You may have said that, too. But the bottom line is, we are the strongest nation in the world. We provide the leadership and we\u2019re going to have to continue to provide the leadership, but let\u2019s do it on our terms when our interests are involved and not when somebody blows the whistle at the United Nations."}

It is the strongest, best prepared, best equipped it has ever been. There is very little difference in the budget that I proposed and the Republican budget over the next six-year period. We are spending a lot of money to modernize our weapons system. I have proposed a lot of new investments to improve the quality of life for our soldiers, for our men and women in uniform, for their families, for their training. That is my solemn obligation. You ask when do you decide to deploy them. The interests of the American people must be at stake. Our values must be at stake. We have to be able to make a difference. And frankly we have to consider what the risks are to our young men and women in uniform. But I believe the evidence is that our deployments have been successful, in Haiti, in Bosnia, when we moved to Kuwait to repel Saddam Hussein\u2019s threatened invasion of Kuwait. When I have sent the fleet into the Taiwan straits. When we\u2019ve worked hard to end the Northern Korean nuclear threat. I believe the United States is at peace tonight in part because of the disciplined, careful, effective deployment of our military resources."}

You look at North Korea where they have enough plutonium to build six nuclear bombs. We\u2019ve sort of distanced ourselves from our ally, South Korea. They lost about a million people in the war, the Korean War, the forgotten war. We lost 53,000 Americans. We shouldn\u2019t be doing any favors for North Korea. It\u2019s a closed society. We don\u2019t have any inspection. We don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s going to work or not, but we keep giving the incentives. Someone called them something else. Incentives. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. Here we have Cuba 90 miles from our shores, and what have we done, we passed the law that gave people a right to sue and the President postponed it for six months. And it seemed to me if you want to send a signal, you\u2019ve got to send a signal, Mr. President. The sooner the better off we\u2019ll be, if you put tougher sanctions on Castro, not try to make it easier for him."}

In 1992, before I became President, the Congress passed the Cuba Democracy Act and I enforced it vigorously. We made the embargo tougher but we increased contacts people to people with the Cubans, including direct telephone service, which was largely supported by the Cuban-American community. Then Cuba shot down two of our planes and murdered four people in international air space. They were completely beyond the pale of the law, and I signed the Helms-Burton legislation. Senator Dole is correct. I did give about six months before the effective date of the act before lawsuits can actually be filed, even though they\u2019re effective now, and can be legally binding, because I want to change Cuba. And the United States needs help from other countries. Nobody in the world agrees with our policy on Cuba now. But this law can be used as leverage to get other countries to help us to move Cuba to democracy. Every single country in Latin America, Central America and the Caribbean is a democracy tonight but Cuba. And if we stay firm and strong, we will be able to bring Cuba around as well."}

We have to be firm and strong. And I hope that will happen. It will happen starting next January and maybe it can happen the balance of this year. We have not been firm and strong. You look at the poor people who still live in Cuba. It\u2019s a haven for drug smugglers and we don\u2019t have a firm policy when it comes to Fidel Castro. In my view, the policy has failed. So Congress passes the law, the President signs it, like he does a lot of things. But he, like welfare reform, I\u2019m going to sign it but I\u2019m going to try to change it next year. A lot of these election-year conversions, the President talks about the drug money, and all the other things, all this antismoking campaign all happened in 1996. And I think the people viewing out there ought to go back and take a look at the record when he fought a balanced budget amendment. When he gave you that biggest tax increase in history; when he tried to take over your healthcare system. When he fought regulatory reform that cost the average family 6 to $7,000 a year. This is a serious business. It\u2019s about your family; it\u2019s about your business, and in this case it\u2019s about a firmer policy with Cuba."}

Let me just mention, Senator Dole voted for $900 billion in tax increases. His running mate Jack Kemp once said that Bob Dole never met a tax he didn\u2019t hike. And everybody knows, including the Wall Street Journal, hardly a friend of the Democratic party of this administration, that the \u201982 tax increase he sponsored in inflation-adjusted dollars was the biggest tax increase in American history. So we ought to at least get the facts out here on the table so we can know where to go from here."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":844560000000,"Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"DOLE","Text":"Let me first answer that question about the 1982 tax cut. We were closing loopholes, we were going after big corporations. I know you probably would oppose it, Mr. President, but I think we should have a fairer system and a flatter system, and we\u2019ll have a fairer and flatter system and we\u2019re going to make the economic package work. Healthcare. Well, we finally passed the Kassebaum bill. The President was opposed to it in 1993. He wanted to give us this big system, that took over about one-seventh of the economy, that put on price controls, created all these state alliances, and would cost $1.5 trillion and force people into managed care, whether they wanted it or not. Most people want to see their own doctor. They\u2019re going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president. We won\u2019t threaten anybody. So we passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy, the Kennedy Kassebaum bill that will cover about 20 to 25 million people. We\u2019ve been for that for four, five, six years. The President held it up. And even when it finally got near passage, Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days, because he wasn\u2019t satisfied with one provision. But it will cover preexisting conditions. If you change your job, you\u2019re going to be covered. So there are a lot of good things in this bill we should have done instead of trying this massive, massive takeover by the Federal government. But then of course we had a Democratic Congress and they didn\u2019t want to do that. Until we got a Republican Congress, we finally got action, I\u2019m proud of my colleagues in the Republican Party for getting that done. It means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight."}

Senator Dole remembers well that we actually offered not to even put in a healthcare bill in 1994, uh \u201993, but instead to work with the Senate Republicans and write a joint bill. And they said no because they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big government and make sure nothing was done to aid healthcare before the \u201994 elections so they could make that claim. Well, maybe we bit off more than we could chew, but we\u2019re pursuing a step-by-step reform now. The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that I signed will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change jobs or when somebody in their family\u2019s been sick. I signed a bill to stop these drive-by deliveries when insurance companies can force people out of the hospital after 24 hours and I vetoed Senator Dole\u2019s Medicare plan that would have forced a lot of seniors into managed care and taken a lot more money out of their pockets and led to Medicare withering on the vine."}

You can also deduct long-term care now, so it\u2019s a good it\u2019s a good start. I think there\u2019s enough \u2014 we\u2019re even looking at our tax cut proposal, our economic package. There may be a way of reaching out to the uninsured, because there are a lot of uninsured people in the country, particularly children, that should be covered. Another way you can do is to expand Medicaid. In America no one will go without healthcare, no one will go without food."}

I don\u2019t understand extending the no-fly zone in the south when the trouble was in the north. And what we\u2019ve done during the Bush administration, the Kurds were at the State Department, negotiating, trying to work their differences out. Now we\u2019ve got all thousands and thousands of refugees. We\u2019re even shipping 3,000 Kurds to Guam. It involves Turkey. It\u2019s a real problem. Saddam is probably about as strong as he ever was. We shot, what, 44 cruise missiles, worth about a million-two a piece, and hit some radar, that repaired in a couple, three days. Did we inflict any damage? No. Did we have any allies helping? Well, we have Great Britain. They\u2019re always very loyal to us, and I appreciate that. And of course Kuwait. Even though they had to find out they had 5,000 troops coming, they didn\u2019t even understand that. We had to get their permission. The bottom line is, we went in there alone. We are supposed to be operating under a U.N. resolution. We did it without any of our allies that helped in the Gulf."}

I don\u2019t know. I want to be very serious. I\u2019ve supported the President when I thought he was right on Bosnia. I supported him on NAFTA and GATT. So it\u2019s not that we always disagree. Others disagreed with us. The Mideast is very difficult. But it seemed to me just as an observer that you know before you\u2019d call somebody to America, you\u2019d have some notion what the end result might be. Now maybe it\u2019s better just to get together and sit down and talk. Maybe that was the purpose. And I know talks have started again today. But again it\u2019s almost like an ad hoc foreign policy. It\u2019s ad hoc, it\u2019s sort of we get up in the morning and read the papers, what country\u2019s in trouble, we\u2019ll have a meeting. Now, to me that\u2019s not the strategy that I think people expect from America. I think we have lost credibility, and I say this very honestly without any partisanship. We\u2019ve lost credibility around the world. Our allies know, \u2014 they\u2019re not certain what we\u2019re going to do, what our reaction, what our response is going to be. Nobody suggested sending troops to Iraq, if that was the hint there from the President. But I do think that Saddam Hussein is stronger than he was. And I do believe that we didn\u2019t gain a great deal in the Mideast by bringing three of the four leaders, one refused to come, to Washington D.C."}

It is a very difficult environment. The feelings are very strong. There are extremists in all parts of the Middle East who want to kill that peace process. Prime Minister Rabin gave his life because someone in his own country literally hated him for trying to bring peace. I would like to have had a big, organized summit, but those people were killing each other, rapidly, innocent Arab children, innocent Israeli people, they were dying. And there is ,so much trust has broken down in the aftermath of the change of government. I felt that if I could just get the parties together to say let\u2019s stop the violence, start talking, commit to the negotiations, that would be a plus. Now today the Secretary of State is in the Middle East and they\u2019ve started negotiations and all those leaders promised me they would not quit until they resolved the issues between them and got the peace process going forward again."}

But I believe America is the greatest country in human history because we have maintained freedom and increasing prosperity by relentlessly pushing the barriers of knowledge, the barriers of the present, always moving into the future. That\u2019s why when I became President I was determined to kind of move beyond this whole stale debate that had gone on in Washington for too long to get this country moving again. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got a country with ten and a half million more jobs, and record numbers of new businesses, and rising incomes, and falling crime rates, and welfare roll rates. That\u2019s why we\u2019re moving in the right direction. And I\u2019m trying to emphasize that what I want to do is to continue to do that. That\u2019s why my balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy. That\u2019s why I want a tax cut for education and child rearing, but it\u2019s got to be paid for. That\u2019s why I want to continue the work we have done over partisan opposition, to work with communities to bring that crime rate down until our streets are all safe again.

But 11 million new jobs and everything, I mean the President can\u2019t take credit for everything that governors are doing, whether that\u2019s happening in New York City when it comes to the murder rate and then not be responsible for the bad things that happen, whether it\u2019s drug use or something else in America. So it seems to me that we can talk about what we call Kenny, the great exaggerator. He just liked to make it sound exager, a little better, made him feel better.

We\u2019ve got people watching tonight and listening tonight trying to find the truth. And the truth is, there is a lot wrong with America.

I don\u2019t fault the President or the vice president for sending their children to private schools or better schools. I applaud them for it, I don\u2019t criticize them.

We\u2019ve worked hard to expand public school choice in my balanced budget bill. There\u2019s funds for 3,000 new schools created by teachers and parents, sometimes by business people, called charter schools that have no rules, they\u2019re free of bureaucracy and can only stay in existence if they perform and teach children. The ones that are out there are doing well. What I\u2019m against is Senator Dole\u2019s plan to take money away from all the children we now help with limited Federal funds and help far fewer. If we\u2019re going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be done at the local level or the state level. But Senator Dole has consistently opposed Federal help to education. He voted against student loans; he voted against my improved student loan plan; he voted against the National Service bill, against the HeadStart bill; he voted against our efforts in safe and drug-free schools. He voted against these programs, he does not believe it. That\u2019s the issue. 90 percent of our kids are out there in those public schools and we need to lift their standards and move them forward with the programs like those I\u2019ve outlined in this campaign."}

Let\u2019s give low income parents the same right that people of power and prestige have in America and let them go to better schools.

I support school choice. I have advocated expansions of public school choice alternatives and I said the creation of 3,000 new schools that we are going to help the states to finance. But if you\u2019re going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be determined by states in localities where they\u2019re raising and spending most of the money. I simply think it\u2019s wrong to take money away from programs that are helping build basic skills for kids, 90 percent of them are in the public schools; to take money away from programs that are helping fund the school lunch program, that are helping to fund the other programs, that are helping our schools to improve their standards. Our schools are getting better, and our schools can be made to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level. I have been a strong force for reform. And, Senator, I remind you that a few years ago when I supported teacher testing while in my home state I was pretty well lambasted by the teachers association. I just don\u2019t believe we ought to be out there running down teachers and attacking them the way you did at the Republican convention. I think we ought to be lifting them up and moving our children forward. And let me just say that budget that you passed that I vetoed would have cut 50,000 kids out of Headstart. It would have eliminated the AmeriCorps plan and it would have cut back on student loans and scholarships. Now, it would have. That\u2019s a fact. That\u2019s one of the big reasons I vetoed it. We need to be doing more in education, not less."}

It costs about $27,000 to pay people to volunteer. We\u2019ve got four million young people volunteering every year, the number hasn\u2019t gone down. And you pick out 20,000, whether they need the money or not, and they get paid for volunteering. I like young people. I like teachers. I\u2019m a product of a public school. You attended a private school for some time in your life. I like teachers. You\u2019re not for school choice, you can\u2019t be for school choice, because this is that special interest money again. When you get 99.5 percent of the money, we don\u2019t know what happened to the other .5 percent, we\u2019re looking for it, somebody got it, but it all went to Democrats. And this is part of that liberal establishment, one of those liberal things that you just can\u2019t do. You\u2019re for school uniforms and curfews and you\u2019re opposed to truancy. Now that\u2019s not reform, Mr. President. Why can\u2019t Landale Shakespeare in Cleveland or Pilar Gonzales in Milwaukee give their children an opportunity to go to a better school. Some schools aren\u2019t safe. Some schools aren\u2019t even safe. Your choice is nothing. Let\u2019s give them a real choice, the kind of choice you had, and the kind of choice a lot of people have in America.

I was able for two years when I was in, a very young boy to go to a Catholic school, but I basically went to public schools all my life. And I\u2019ve worked hard for a long time to make them better, 90 percent of our kids are there. You, it\u2019s amazing to me, you are all for having more responsibility at the local level for everything except schools. Where we don\u2019t have very much money at the Federal level to spend on education, we ought to spend it helping the 90 percent of the kids that we can help. If a local school district in Cleveland or anyplace else wants to have a private choice plan like Milwaukee did, let them have at it. I might say the results are highly ambiguous. But I want to get out there and give a better education opportunity to all of our children and that\u2019s why I vetoed the budget you passed with $30 billion in education cuts.

And their idea was that they knew what was best for the American people. Now, I feel very strongly about a lot of things. I feel strongly about education. I want to help young people have an education, just as I had an education after World War II with the GI bill of Rights. We\u2019ve had millions of young men and women in subsequent subsequent wars change the face of the nation because the government helped with their education. Now the reason they don\u2019t have, The reason the President can\u2019t support this is pretty obvious. It\u2019s not taking anything away from schools, it\u2019s new money. It\u2019s not being taken away from anybody else, except we\u2019ll downsize the Department of Education. But this is a very liberal administration. This is an administration that gave you the big tax cut. This administration tried to take over healthcare and impose a governmental system. This is the administration that fought regulatory reform that is putting a lot of small businessmen and small businesswomen out of business. This is the administration that fought the balanced budget amendment and vetoed a balanced budget and vetoed welfare reform twice, and the list goes on and on and on, that\u2019s what I had in mind. I want people in my administration and will have people in my administration who understand America. There won\u2019t be 10 millionaires and 14 lawyers in the cabinet.

It\u2019s a record they think they can play that everybody loves to hear. And I just don\u2019t think that dog will hunt this time. The American people should make up their own mind. Here\u2019s the record: We cut deficit four years in a row for the first time before the Civil War \u2014 I mean, before World War II, and maybe before the Civil War, too. We\u2019ve got ten and a half million new jobs; we\u2019ve got record numbers of those new small businesses. We\u2019ve made every one of them eligible for a tax cut. We\u2019ve got declining crime rates, two million fewer people on welfare rolls before welfare reform passed, and a 50 percent increase in child support and a crime bill with 60 death penalties and 100,000 police and the assault weapons ban.

The first thing you did when you came into office was set up the stimulus package, said we\u2019ve got a little pork we want to scatter around America, $16 billion. And even some in your own party couldn\u2019t buy that. I remember talking by the telephone. I\u2019m not even certain you were too excited about that. I won\u2019t, I never repeat what I\u2019ve talked to the President about. In any event, we saved the taxpayers $16 billion.

I believe that we have to do these things with a government that\u2019s smaller and less bureaucratic, but that we have to do them nonetheless. It\u2019s inconvenient for Senator Dole, but the truth is I\u2019ve reduced the size of government more than my Republican predecessors. And I did stop them, I admit that. I sure stopped their budget. Their budget cut enforcement for the Environmental Protection Agency by a third. It cut funds to clean up toxic waste dumps with 10 million of our kids still living within four miles of a toxic waste dump, by a third. It ended the principle that the polluters should pay for those toxic waste dumps unless it was very recent. Their budget weakened our support for education. $30 billion, even cut funds for scholarships and college loans. Their budget cut $270 billion in Medicare and, finally, their budget withdrew the national guarantee of healthcare to poor children, families with children with handicaps, the elderly in nursing homes, poor pregnant women. It was wrong for the country and calling it conservative won\u2019t make it right. It was a bad decision for America and would have been bad for our future if I hadn\u2019t stopped it."}

I\u2019ve just finished reading a book, I think it\u2019s called \u2014 what is it called, what is it, The Demise of the Democratic Party by Ronald Cardash (ph) or something talking about all the liberal influences in the administration.

The bottom line is this: I think the American people, thought he\u2019d recite all these bills and all these things, they want to know what\u2019s going to happen to them. They\u2019ve all got a lot of anxieties out there. Did anybody complain when you raised taxes? Did anybody go out and ask the people, how are you going to pay the extra money? That\u2019s why we want an economic package. We want the government to pinch their pennies for a change instead of the people pinching their pennies.

I wouldn\u2019t want to be a liberal either, Mr. President, but you\u2019re stuck with it because that\u2019s your record, that\u2019s your record in Arkansas: The biggest tax increase in history.

I think a targeted tax cut is better for our future, targeted to education and child rearing, with the rest of the education plan, hooking up all of our classrooms to the Internet by the year 2000. Making sure we\u2019ve got an army of reading volunteers, trained people to teach with parents and teachers so that our eight year olds can learn to read. Investing in our environment. Cleaning up two-thirds of the worst toxic waste dumps. Those plans are better than this $550 billion tax scheme. Now, remember, folks, even Senator Dole\u2019s campaign co-chair here, Senator D\u2019Amato, says he\u2019s got to cut Medicare to pay for this. Everybody who\u2019s looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it\u2019s bad for the economy. It\u2019s going to blow a hole in the deficit It\u2019s going to raise taxes on nine million people and require bigger cuts than the one I vetoed.

I said we\u2019d get tougher with child support and child support enforcement\u2019s up 50 percent. I said that I would work for tax relief for middle class Americans. The deficit was bigger than I thought it was going to be. I think they\u2019re better off, all of us are, that we got the interest rates down and the deficit down. Republicans talk about it, but we\u2019re the first the first administration in anybody\u2019s lifetime looking at this program to bring that deficit down four years in a row. We still gave tax cuts to 15 million working Americans, and now I\u2019ve got a plan that\u2019s been out there for two years, it could have been passed already, but instead the Republicans shut the government down to try to force their budget and their plan on me, and I couldn\u2019t take that. But we\u2019ll get the rest of that tax relief. And so I think when you look at those results, you know the plan I\u2019ve laid out for the future has a very good chance of being enacted if you\u2019ll give me a chance to build that bridge to the 21st Century."}

He came in with a high growth rate, the 1990 budget agreement, which some, you know, didn\u2019t like, had some very tough cost controls, put a lot of pressure on Congress. The S & L crisis was over, they\u2019re starting to sell assets, all that money was coming in. And he cut defense an extra $60 billion, threw a lot of people out of work. He talks about a smaller government. There are actually more people in government except for people in defense related jobs. They\u2019re gone. The government\u2019s bigger than it was when President Kennedy was around, even though he says it\u2019s not. In addition, Republican Congress cut $53 billion. So let\u2019s just, let\u2019s give credit where credit is due. Governor Engler of Michigan cut taxes 21 times, created a lot of new jobs. So did Governor Thompson, so did Governor Rowland. A lot of people ought to deserve credit, Mr. President.

I want to say in the beginning that I am profoundly grateful for the chance that you have given me to serve as president for the last four years. I never could have dreamed anything like this would come my way in life, and I\u2019ve done my best to be faithful to the charge you\u2019ve given me. I\u2019m proud of the fact that America is stronger and more prosperous and more secure than we were four years ago. And I\u2019m glad we\u2019re going in the right direction. And I\u2019ve done my best tonight to lay out my plans for going forward to an even better future in the next century. I\u2019d like to leave you with the thought that the things I do as president are basically driven by the people whose lives I have seen affected by what does or doesn\u2019t happen in this country. The auto worker in Toledo who was unemployed when I was elected and now has a great job because we\u2019re number one in auto production again. All the people I\u2019ve met who used to be on welfare who are now working and raising their children. And I think what others could do for our country and themselves if we did the welfare reform thing in the proper way. I think of the man who grabbed me by the shoulder once with tears in his eyes and said his daughter was dying of cancer and he thanked me for giving him a chance to spend some time with her without losing his job because of the Family and Medical Leave Act. I think of all the people I grew up with and went to school with and who I stay in touch with and who nerve let me forget how what we do in Washington affects all of you out there in America. Folks, we can build that bridge to the 21st Century, big enough and strong enough for all of us to walk across, and I hope you will help me build it."}

People are watching not only throughout this country, but all over the world as to how this democracy can function with civility and respect, and decency and integrity. Bob Dole, um, is one of those men who served in the United States Senate, his public life is a public record. He fought on the battlefield. He has worked with Democrats and Republicans. In my opinion, it is beneath Bob Dole to go after anyone personally. Clearly, Abraham Lincoln put it best when he said you serve your party best by serving the nation first. And I can\u2019t think of a better way of serving this nation in 1996 than by electing Bob Dole as the President of the United States of America. These issues are fully capable of being understood and reflected upon by the American people. This is a democracy in which we have the freest press and the greatest First Amendment rights in the history of mankind. And Bob and I respect that.

We have a positive plan based on three principles. We want to provide opportunity for all Americans. We insist on responsibility being accepted in turn by everyone, and we want to strengthen our communities and their ability to support families and individuals in our common effort to create a bright future. Here\u2019s how we plan to do that: We have a balanced budget plan that has targeted tax cuts for middle-income families. We\u2019ve already given tax cuts to 15 million of the hardest pressed working families in America. Our plan for the next four years features a $1,500 tax credit, called a Hope Scholarship, for tuition at community college, junior college or college. A $10,000 tax deduction for college tuition for those who go further, so that, in essence, no American family will ever be taxed on the money they spend for college tuition. Also, tax relief for first-time home buyers, tax encouragement for savings and help in paying health care expenses, and a tax break, actually, the elimination of capital gains taxes on the \u2014 on the profits from the sale of a home. All of this is within a balanced budget plan, which protects Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment."}

Our education is not up to the standards that the American family and the American people want for their children. And, clearly, the welfare system is a disgrace to our Judeo-Christian principles. It is not the values of the poor that should be called into question, it is the values of the welfare system from Washington and uh that prevent people from climbing out of poverty. Our biggest debate with this administration on domestic policy is that they think we\u2019re at our fullest capacity, that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve reached our potential and 2.5 percent growth is enough for America. Frankly, that is not good enough for this country. We can not just run the clock out on the 20th Century. It, clearly, we need to lower the tax rate across the board on working and saving and investing. I know my friend, Al, will suggest that is trickle-down economics. Well, Al, if it\u2019s trickle-down economics, ask Van Woods, a young entrepreneur who owns a restaurant in Harlem, if it\u2019s trickle down. He said he would hire 60 more people if we cut the Capital Gains Tax."}

Your original answer was about the contrast.

It would blow a hole in the deficit, cause much deeper cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment and knock our economy off track, raising interest rates, mortgage rates and car payments. We stopped that plan before. We will stop it again. We want a positive plan for growth and more jobs."}

Bob Dole and I want to cut the tax rates across the board on each and every American, working, saving, investing and taking risks in America. All wealth is created, and all growth is generated by risk-taking entrepreneurs. The tax rate on capital in America is way too high. It\u2019s too high on the family and it\u2019s particularly too high on working men and women. The average family in America, at median level of income, probably is spending 25 to 26 percent of their income sent to the federal government. That\u2019s more than shelter, food, clothing, and energy. That\u2019s just not right. When I was growing up in Los Angeles, my parents were a one working family, one breadwinner per family was all that was necessary. Now if a woman wants to go to work or a man wants to go to work, it ought to be their choice, not the choice of the Washington, D.C. establishment. Bill Clinton, the President, and Al Gore, suggest that they\u2019ll give us a tax cut, but only if we do exactly what they want us to do. That isn\u2019t America. That\u2019s social engineering. The tax code should reflect our values in a Judeo-Christian sense, that work, honesty and integrity and contracts and property and investment and savings should be rewarded, and Bob Dole and Jack Kemp are not only going to cut the tax rates across the board and lower the Capital Gain Tax. I\u2019ll be glad to talk about it a little later, because there\u2019s not enough time, but we are going to repeal the 83-year-old code and replace the seven and a half million words with a flatter, fairer, simpler code that will take this country roaring in the 21st Century."}

There\u2019s another feature I would like to hear Mr. Kemp speak about. Just before he joined Senator Dole on the ticket, he said that the plan \u2014 the part of the plan that raises taxes on 9 million of the hardest working families in America was unconscionable, that means it\u2019s wrong and it shouldn\u2019t happen.

Now, the first thing that we are trying to do is to create a million new jobs in the inner cities of this country, with tax credits for employers who hire people who are now unemployed. We are seeking to have vigorous enforcement of the laws that bar discrimination. Now, I want to congratulate Mr. Kemp for being a lonely voice in the Republican party over the years on this question. It is \u2014 it is with some sadness that I refer to the fact that the day after he joined Senator Dole\u2019s ticket, he announced that he was changing his position and was hereto, thereafter going to adopt Senator Dole\u2019s position to end all affirmative action.

Uh, Affirmative Action should be predicated upon need, not equality of reward, not equality of outcome. Quotas have always been against the American ideal. We should promote diversity and we should do it the way Bob Dole has been talking about, with a new civil rights agenda, based upon expanding access to credit and capital, job opportunities, educational choice in our inner cities for a young urban mother who can\u2019t get the type of an education she wants for her child, and, ultimately, the type of ownership and entrepreneurship from public housing in, D.C. to Nickerson Gardens in Watts, Los Angeles.

Our country is as the Kerner Commission Report suggested a number of years ago was being split, but they said between white and black. I think it\u2019s being split, Jim, not so much between white and black, although that\u2019s still a very serious problem. We really have two economies. Our general economy, our national economy, our mainstream economy is democratic, is based on incentives, a small \u201cd\u201d Al, it\u2019s capitalism and incentives for working and saving and investing and producing, and families and the things that really lead to progress up that ladder that we call \u201cThe American Dream,\u201d but is what is really universal. But unfortunately, in urban America, and I was glad to hear the Vice President talk a little bit about it, uh there \u2014 they have abandoned the inner cities. There\u2019s a socialist economy. There\u2019s no private housing. There\u2019s mostly public housing. You\u2019re told where to go to school, you\u2019re told what to buy with food stamps.

Earl Graves of \u201cBlack Enterprise\u201d magazine said the single greatest deterrent to black advancement is the lack of access to capital, the credit and ownership. That will change. We will green-line every city in the United States where there is unemployment and welfare and we will eliminate the Capital Gains Tax, eliminate the tax on a welfare mother that takes a job.

The Congress passed uh an enterprise zone after the Los Angeles riots five years ago. It was vetoed by the prior administration. Now, to your question. We have a specific plan to create 1 million new jobs in the inner cities of America with tax credits for employers who hire people coming off welfare, \u2019cause we\u2019ve passed welfare reform now, we promised to end welfare as we know it. And we are implementing this new legislation. We have moved 1.9 million people off of the welfare rolls and into good jobs in the last four years. Our new plan is to have 1 million more jobs in the inner cities, but that\u2019s not all. We are also implementing the plan to put 100,000 community police officers in our cities.

Clearly, the Gordian knot needs to be broken in one fell swoop. Bob Dole and Jack Kemp, as soon as we get through this first step of cutting tax rates across the board, are going to repeal the whole code while Bill Clinton and my friend, Al Gore, defend the status quo. We\u2019re going to repeal the seven-and-a-half million words of the U.S.tax code, make it tax income once, not twice, three, four, and if you die, it confiscates your estate. We must have a tax code going into the 21st Century that does not protect the establishment and this tax code does. And by cutting and eliminating the Capital Gains, by cutting and eliminating the Estate Tax, by bringing the top tax rate down to something reasonable, like \u2014 here he goes again \u2014 I think in peacetime, it shouldn\u2019t be higher, Bob, and I don\u2019t think it should be higher than 25 percent, phased in. But capital would flow out into the economy. We have people getting access to capital. Small businessmen and women, African-American, Asian Americans, Latino Americans, female Americans would be able to start their businesses. Dana Crist of Lancaster said the day the tax bill is passed in Congress, she will open a new factory with 40 or 50 or 60 employees in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He\u2019ll call that trickle down.

Now, it is part of the plan that he is supporting. Not only that, though, it would blow a hole in the deficit, it would raise interest rates. That means higher mortgage payments, particularly those with the variable rate mortgages, higher car payments, he would also lead to much deeper cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. It is extremely risky. And as for these harsh words, I don\u2019t take them personally. He said much worse about Bob Dole when he said Bob Dole never met a tax that he didn\u2019t hike.

Medicare will be saved because it will be put into a commission where both Bill Clinton and Bob Dole recognize it has to be studied by the same people that would study \u2014 or did study, I should say, the Social Security System and saved it in 1983 and \u201984.

Medicare has been adjusted 23 times since it was created in 1965.

I don\u2019t think he\u2019s \u2014 he didn\u2019t believe in it then, and the plan that he promoted last year would have certainly been devastating to Medicare. Again, don\u2019t take my word for it. The American Hospital Association said it could have closed 700 hospitals. The Catholic Health Association, the AARP, and many other groups who pay careful attention to Medicare said that the Dole\/Gingrich plan on Medicare would have led to deep cuts, possibly set up a two-tiered system, and would have ended the kind of Medicare system that we have.

What has to be discussed is how we, as a nation, are going to create the size of an economy, create a national wealth that would at least double this 6 or 7 trillion economy. We would have $6 trillion in 15 years extra wealth for the American people. Another trillion dollars of revenue, with which to save Medicare and Social Security.

They can\u2019t go too low, because there\u2019s not enough revenue, but President Clinton apologized in Houston for saying, whoops, I raised your taxes and they\u2019re too high.

Let me first say that. In citing John F. Kennedy\u2019s tax cut in the 1960s, I want to also remind you that Mr. Kemp has pointed out in the past, Bob Dole was in the Congress then. He was one of those who voted against John F. Kennedy\u2019s tax cut. The environment faces dire threats from the kind of legislation that Senator Dole and Speaker Newt Gingrich tried to pass by shutting down the government and attempting to force President Clinton to accept it. They invited the lobbyists for the biggest polluters in America to come into the Congress and literally rewrite the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act. President Clinton stopped them dead in their tracks. We have a positive agenda on the environment because we believe very deeply that it\u2019s about our children and our future. Clean air and clean water, cleaning up toxic waste sites, when millions of children live within one mile of them. That\u2019s important. We have a plan to clean up two-thirds of the toxic waste sites in America over the next four years. We\u2019ve already cleaned up more in the last three years than the previous two administrations did in 12. The President just set aside the Utah National Monument. He is protecting the Everglades here in Florida. Bob Dole is opposed to that plan. President Bill Clinton will protect our environment and prevent the kind of attacks on it that we saw in the last Congress and are included in the Republican platform."}

Look, we recognize that this country has to live in balance with our environment. Every one of us who have children and grandchildren recognize how we have to reach a balance. It is not jobs versus our environment. Both are important. This is the most overregulated, overly litigated economy in our nation\u2019s history. And to call a businessman or woman who sits down and has a chance to express his or her interest in how to make these laws work and call them a polluter is just outrageous.

That is a reign of terror. It\u2019s happening. In Oregon, not too long ago, a farmer took 25 percent of his property and declared it a wetland. It had the runoff of snow that allowed it to be declared a wetland, but he did it himself voluntarily. He found within a couple of years that the Bald Eagle began to use it as a habitat. The Corporations of Engineers, the Bureau of Wildlife and Fisheries, all of the federal agencies came onto his property, declared it a federal wetland and said he couldn\u2019t drive. They took away the road, he couldn\u2019t mend his fences and they wouldn\u2019t pay the value of the loss of the \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t pay \u2014 or compensate, I should say, for the loss of value to that property.

We think that the protection of job safety in the workplace is very, very important, but what we\u2019ve said is look, start, start measuring the results. We found that the inspectors were being rewarded on the basis of how many fines they issued. We changed that completely. They used to go in and give somebody a fine if they didn\u2019t have a poster on the wall informing employees of their rights.

As long as a woman or man wants to go to work it ought to be their choice, but in America today that woman or man must work in a family to, one to pay the tax and the other to help the family. That\u2019s not America. It doesn\u2019t leave enough time for the children. It doesn\u2019t leave enough time for people to enjoy their families. It doesn\u2019t allow people to save. The family is the most overtaxed institution in the United States of America. When I was growing up in Los Angeles, a family that median level of income might have sent four or five percent of their income to the federal government. Today, it\u2019s close to 30, or at least 27 or 28%. That\u2019s just unacceptable, and for Al Gore to keep suggesting that we can\u2019t afford to reduce the tax rates across-the-board on the American people and on the formation of the capital necessary to create the new jobs for America is just totally at odds with the experience of both Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy and other times in this century. One other thing that\u2019s very, very important. To call it a risky scheme reminds me of the fact that this administration is suggesting that they\u2019re going to give you a tax cut if you\u2019ll do what they want you to do. They want to cut the Capital Gain Tax, but only for home owners. How about the small businessmen and women of America that create 91% of all the new jobs? My Daddy was a truck driver who bought the truck and started a company. We need more truck drivers becoming truck owners and they can\u2019t do it if they don\u2019t have access to the capital and the seed corn for the next generation of truck and jobs for America."}

Our empowerment zones and enterprise communities, the tax credits that will encourage the formation of new businesses, the new approach by the small business administration to get more loans out to individuals that have not had equal access to capital in the past. These are parts of the plan. Another part of it is the community development financial institutions. And the \u2014 and the law that says deposits that are made in a community, in the inner cities say, should be kept in the community, not entirely, but some percentage of them should be kept there.

I think this is the most exciting time in the history of the world to be alive. We have lived through what Jean Kirpatrick called the bloodiest century in mankind\u2019s history. We have defeated in this system of ours fascism, Nazism, communism, socialism is defunct or debunked around the world, the evil of apartheid has ended. There is only one last question remaining for the next century, indeed the next millennium. Can we, in America, make the world\u2019s greatest liberal democracy, this democratic experiment in private property, limited government, the rule of law, respect for families and traditional Judeo-Christian values work, so it can be a blessing to our country and a blessing to the rest of the world? With all due respect to this administration, they\u2019ve got a foreign policy in disarray. They have a lack of credibility around the world. Weakness, I said earlier, is provocative and clearly, this economy is not performing up to the standards that we would expect from this great nation going into the most exciting global economy the world has ever known. There\u2019s something amiss. Our culture seems to be weakening all around us. Families are under tremendous pressure. People do not \u2014 do not feel safe in their homes. A mother doesn\u2019t feel safe sending her child to school. Our schools are not educating. It\u2019s not the problem of the teachers. They are overworked and my daughter will tell you, they are underpaid and we know that, they need to be empowered. We need to reform education. We need to reform welfare. We need to reform litigation and regulation. And we certainly need to reform this tax code that is a product of this terrible century of war and recession and inflations. It can be done. We need somebody who understands the potential of the American people, who are not just doing well for ourselves, we need to do well for the rest of the world, because they\u2019re looking at us. And we need to make it work in every neighborhood and community in America and for every family, so that no one as Bob Dole said in his San Diego acceptance speech is left behind. Bob Dole, as I said earlier, is a man of courage, a man of principles, a man who crawled out of a fox hole on Riva Ridge in 1945 to save a wounded brethren. The bible says no greater love hath a man than he gave his life. Well, Bob Dole did, just about, he\u2019d been through the valley of the shadow and he as Commander-in-Chief can take this country with the courage of Churchill. The principles of Lincoln and the indefatigable optimism and spirit that this nation expects from its Commander-in-Chief and the next President of the United States, Bob Dole."}

Thanks again to the people of St. Petersburg and thanks again to Jack Kemp. I have enormous respect for Jack Kemp and for Bob Dole. They\u2019re good men. I don\u2019t agree with their plan. I\u2019ve tried to make that clear tonight. And one reason I\u2019ve tried to make it clear is that in just 27 days, the United States of America has an important choice to make. Between two approaches to the future of this country. We have a plan that will create millions more jobs, bring the deficits down further and balance the budget, while protecting Medicare, protecting Medicaid, protecting and preserving the environment, our air, our water, the Everglades, the Tongas, the Mojave Desert in California, the Utah-Red Rocks area, all of which have been protected by President Bill Clinton. We also have a plan to expand access to education. There\u2019s a family in the audience tonight, the McNeil family, who lives right here in St. Petersburg. Both parents are teachers, they\u2019re not rich in money, but they have strong values and they value education. They\u2019re oldest son is a freshman at St. Petersburg Junior High \u2014 Junior College. Their younger son, Roderick, is a sophomore in the same high school that Don McNeil teaches at. Roderick is concerned that he may not be able to get the tuition he needs to go to college when the time comes. Our plan gives a $1500 tax credit to make that junior college essentially free. And a $10,000 tax deduction to make it so that no American family, or almost no family, will have to pay taxes on the money they pay for college tuition. This plan also gives tax breaks on the sale of a home, up to $500,000 in profit tax free. It gives the new break for first-time home buyers, and, again, all in the context of a balanced budget. We have seen progress during the last four years because policies like these have been working. This risky scheme that I\u2019ve described tonight has been said by many objective observers to not add up, it would be a serious risk. Our plan, by contrast, has been working and will work more. We want to build a bridge to the 21st Century and we want it to be strong enough and broad enough for all families to cross and we want it to lead to a brighter future for America, \u2019cause our best days are ahead."}

Let me first give you a sports update. The Braves, one; the Cardinals, nothing, early on. I want to thank you and I want to thank everybody here tonight. I want to give a special thanks to my wife Elizabeth, my daughter Robin for their love and support, and thank the people who are listening and watching all over America. In 20 days, you will help decide who will lead this country into the next century. It\u2019s an awesome responsibility. And you must ask yourself, do you know enough about the candidates? You should know as much as possible about each of us. Sometimes the views have been distorted. There\u2019s been millions and millions of dollars of negative advertising spent distorting my views. But I hope tonight you will get a better feel of who Bob Dole is and what he\u2019s all about. And I think first you should \u2014 I should understand that the question on your mind is do I understand your problem. Would I understand it if it occurred to me, and I might just say I\u2019m from a large family. I got lots of relatives and they\u2019re good, average, middle-class, hardworking Americans. They live all across the country. They\u2019re not all Republicans. Maybe all but one. But in any event, I understand the problems. Whether it\u2019s two parents working because one has to pay the taxes and one has to provide for the family, whether it\u2019s a single parent who just barely pays the pressing bills or whether you\u2019re worried about an education for your children going to the best schools, or whether you\u2019re worried about safe playgrounds, drug-free schools, crime-free schools. This is what this election is all about. And hopefully tonight when we conclude this debate you will have a better understanding and the viewing and listening audience will have a better understanding. Thank you."}

Well, thank you, Jim. And thanks to the people of San Diego for giving us this opportunity to have another discussion about the decision we all face in front of people who will make the decision. Again, I will say I will do my best to make this a discussion of ideas and issues, not insults. What really matters is what happens to your future and what happens to our country as we stand on the brink of a new century, a time of extraordinary possibility. I have a simple philosophy that I tried to follow for the last four years: Do what creates opportunity for all, what reinforces responsibility from all of us, and what will help us build a community where everybody\u2019s got a role to play and a place at the table. Compared to four years ago, we\u2019re clearly better off. We\u2019ve got ten and a half million more jobs, the deficit\u2019s been reduced by 60 percent. Incomes are rising for the first time in a decade, the crime rates, the welfare rolls are falling, we\u2019re putting , 100,000 more police on the street. 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers have been denied handguns. But that progress is only the beginning. What we really should focus on tonight is what we still have to do to help the American people make the most of this future that\u2019s out there. I think what really matters is what we can do to build strong families. Strong families need a strong economy. To me that means we have to go on and balance this budget while we protect Medicare and Medicaid and education and the environment. We should give a tax cut, targeted to child rearing and education, to buying a first home and paying for health care. We ought to help protect our kids from drugs and guns and gangs and tobacco. We ought to help move a million people from welfare to work and we ought to create the finest education system in the world where every 18-year-old can go on to college and all of our younger children have great educational opportunities. If we do those things, we can build that bridge to the 21st century. That\u2019s what I hope to get to talk about tonight. Thank you."}
{"Title":"October 16, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Second Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":845424000000,"Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"DOLE","Text":"Well, I would say first of all, I think, it\u2019s a very good question. I appreciate the quote from the young man. There\u2019s no doubt about it that many American people have lost their faith in government. They see scandals almost on a daily basis. They see ethical problems in the Whitehouse today. They see 900 FBI files, private person, being gathered up by somebody in the Whitehouse. Nobody knows who hired this man. So there\u2019s a great deal of cynicism out there. But I\u2019ve always tried in whatever I\u2019ve done is to bring people together. I said in my acceptance speech in San Diego about two months ago that the exits are clearly marked. If you think the Republican party is some place for you to come if you\u2019re narrow minded or bigoted or don\u2019t like certain people in America, the exits are clearly marked for you to walk out of as I stand here without compromise, because this is the party of Lincoln. I think we have a real obligation, obviously public officials. I\u2019m no longer a public official. I left public life on June the 11th of this year. But it is very important. Young people are looking to us. They\u2019re looking to us for leadership. They\u2019re watching what we do, what we say, what we promise and what we finally deliver. And I would think, it seems to me that there are opportunities here. When I\u2019m President of the United States, I will keep my word. My word is my bond."}

And if you remember four years ago, we had not only rising unemployment, but a lot of rising cynicism. I had never worked in Washington as an elected official. It seemed to me that most of the arguments were partisan, Republican, Democrat, left, right, liberal, conservative. That\u2019s why I said tonight I\u2019m for opportunity, responsibility and community. And we\u2019ve gotten some real progress in the last four years. I\u2019ve also done everything I could at every moment of division in this country, after Oklahoma City, when these churches were burned, to bring people together and remind people that we are stronger because of our diversity. We have to respect one another. You mentioned Washington and Lincoln. They were presidents at historic times. This is an historic time. It\u2019s important we go beyond those old partisan arguments and focus on people and their future. When we do that, instead of shutting the government down over a partisan fight over the budget, we\u2019re a better country and that\u2019s why we\u2019re making progress now."}

I know you do it. Everybody here does it. You do a lot of things nobody knows about. I have a little foundation for the disabled called the Dole Foundation. We\u2019ve raised about $10 million. We don\u2019t talk about it. We try to help people with disabilities. Bring them back into the mainstream of public life. So it seems to me that there\u2019s also a public trust. When you\u2019re the president of the United States, you have a public trust and you have to keep that public trust, as George Washington, as Abraham Lincoln did. And I think now that trust is being violated and it seems to me we ought to face up to it, and the president ought to say tonight that he\u2019s not going to pardon anybody that he was involved in business with who might implicate him later on."}

First of all, let me say what we have done. In the last four years we\u2019ve worked hard to promote more competition to bring down the rate of inflation in health care costs without eroding health care quality. The government pays for Medicare and Medicaid, as you know, and that\u2019s very important. Secondly, we\u2019ve added a million more children to the ranks of the insured through the Medicaid program. We have protected 25 million people through the passage of the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that says you can use your health insurance if you change jobs or someone in your family has been sick. We just recently ended those drive-by deliveries saying people can\u2019t be kicked out of the hospital by insurance companies when they\u2019ve just had babies. So this is, that\u2019s a good start. In the next four years, I want to focus on the following things. Number one, add another million children to the insured ranks through the Medicaid program. Number two, keep working with the states, as we are now, to add 2.2 million more people to the insurance system. Number three, cover people who are between jobs for up to six months. That could protect 3 million families, 700,000 kids. Number four, make sure we protect the integrity with the Medicare program and Medicaid program and not do anything in cutting costs which would cause hundreds of hospitals to close which could have been the case if the 270billion dollar Medicare cut that I vetoed, had been enacted in the law."}

I have heard you say this time after time. I have heard you say on one TV appearance, \u201cthe media made me do it.\u201d You were trying to defend your cut which was not a cut either, Reduction in the growth of spending. We\u2019ve always had at least 7 percent. You\u2019ve said publicly that it\u2019s now three times the rate of inflation. We ought to cut the growth to twice the rate of inflation. It\u2019s about where we are now. So let\u2019s stop talking about cutting Medicare. In my economic plan we increase it 39percent. Don\u2019t forget what he tried to do with health care. 17 new taxes, spend 1.5 trillion dollars, 50 new bureaucracies. Can you believe that? You couldn\u2019t even have been a cardiologist because he had quotas. You\u2019re a cardiologist, it wouldn\u2019t affect you. But if somebody wanted to be a cardiologist, ten years from now, you\u2019d have to be certain you complied with some of the rules in this extreme medical plan the government was going to take over for all Americans. There are things we can do like the Kassebaum bill. We changed many provisions I authored, cover preexisting conditions, portability, and there are other things we can do. We still need to cover about 20million people and a lot of children."}

But let me just say the American Hospital Association said that the budget I vetoed could have closed 700 hospitals. Not me. On a per-person basis, it did cut way below the rate of inflation in medical costs. But the important thing is what are we going to do now? We need to help people who are between jobs. We need to cover more kids. Provide more preventative care. My balanced budget covers mammograms for ladies, women on Medicare and also gives respite care to the million-plus families who have someone with Alzheimer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. These things are paid for in the balanced budget plan. It\u2019ll move us forward."}

It shouldn\u2019t happen in America. And it\u2019s time we take a look at the pay scales. Did get a 3 percent increase this year, but that\u2019s not enough. If we\u2019re going to ask young men and young women to protect us and defend us around the world, and we\u2019ve had more deployments under this administration than any time in history. Fifty times we deployed troops around the world. Every time you do that you take a risk. Somebody, you know, maybe your son, maybe your grandson, maybe somebody else. But I think anybody who wears a uniform is a great American. Remember Vietnam? Remember when people almost used to walk across the street rather than have a contact with somebody who was in Vietnam? That\u2019s all behind us now, and it should be behind us, and the forgotten war, the Korean War, but I guess I can just answer you very plainly, Jason. Thank you for doing what you\u2019re doing.

I also presented to the Congress and they adopted a large package of quality-of-life improvements, which are very important. I spent a lot of time talking to military families as well as military members all over the world and in bases all across the United States, and I became convinced after talking to the families and the personnel in uniform that we needed to not only have the pay raise but we needed to invest more in child care, housing, and other things to support families, especially when there are longer deployments because of the downsizing of the military. So I, we\u2019re going to do better, and we\u2019ll do better still, but this is a commitment I think that all Americans share without regard to party."}

We had 536 ships. We\u2019re down to 336 ships. I mean, we\u2019ve cut defense spending too much in the first place. The President told you in \u201992 he would cut it 67 billion. He cut 112 billion dollars, so we\u2019re right on the edge right now. But the last thing we ought to do is make those who wear the uniforms sacrifice."}

I propose to spend 1.6 trillion dollars on defense between now and the year 2002 and there\u2019s less than 1 percent difference between my budget and the Republican budget on defense. Now, on the Middle East, as you know, I worked very hard for peace in the Middle East. The agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis was signed at the White House and the agreement \u2014 the peace treaty with Jordan, I was \u2014 I went to Jordan to sign that \u2014 to be there. But \u2014 and I think the United States can do whatever we reasonably can. I can say this: I do not believe Yassir Arafat wants us to send troops to the West Bank. We have never been asked to send troops to the West Bank. I saw the agreement that Prime Minister Rabin and Yassir Arafat signed on the West Bank. It had 26 separate maps they had to sign, literally thousands of delineations of who would do what on the West Bank, and I believe if the parties will get together and in a good-faith manner make that agreement, that they\u2019ll be able to do it if we cannot impose a peace on the Middle East. My position has always been that the job of the United States was to minimize the risks of peace. You know, if they asked me to be part of some monitoring force \u2014 as we are in the Sinai and have been since 1978 \u2014 to monitor the peace between Egypt and Israel, frankly, I would have to think about it. I would have to see what they wanted to do, but I don\u2019t believe that will be the request. I think what Mr. Arafat wants us to do is to make sure that everybody honors the agreements they\u2019ve already made. That\u2019s why I brought the leaders to Washington a few days ago. I think they will, and I think we\u2019ll get there. Don\u2019t be too discouraged."}

If we don\u2019t build more B-2 bombers in California and we lost about 500,000 jobs out in California, because of this devastation, these big, big cuts. We had to make cuts. We didn\u2019t have the cuts the president promised he\u2019d make and then he doubled. I think we need to go back and take a look. We\u2019re increasing defense reasonably \u2014 not too much, but we are increasing defense some \u2014 because we want to be prepared in case somebody here gets called up, Jason. I would say I didn\u2019t hear what Yassir Arafat had to say, but I don\u2019t want to \u2014 you know, I think foreign policy, I want to be very careful about, and I\u2019m not here to argue about the President with some ongoing foreign policy matter. What I want the President to do, and I think he may have done it, his last statement, call for an unconditional end of the violence and have the parties keep on talking as they should talk and have a resolution.

When I asked Yassir Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu to come to Washington and got them together and they talked alone for three hours, I was convinced that they had to have a chance to make that peace. Again, I\u2019d say if they asked us to play some reasonable role, I don\u2019t know how I would respond. It would depend entirely on what they asked us to do, but the real secret there is for them to abide by the agreements they\u2019ve made and find a way to trust each other, and they\u2019re going to have to spend some time and trust each other.

My record going back to 1965 in the Congress, the first vote we had was whether or not you should put a little notice on cigarettes. They may be danger \u2014 I voted I for everything since that time. In fact, 1992 we had a bill come before us that all the states had to comply or they\u2019re going to lose certain money. We sent it to the Clinton Administration for implementation, and they waited three and a half years. And during that period about 3,000 young kids every day started smoking. So you add it up. That\u2019s about three million. Not until again in 1996 \u2014 I don\u2019t want anybody to smoke. My brother probably died partly because of cigarettes. I was asked a technical question.

And it seems to me what we need to do is to talk about not only tobacco but drugs, because drug use between 12- and 17-year-olds has doubled in this administration in the last 44 months. Marijuana use is up 141percent. Cocaine use up 160 percent. They\u2019re your kids. It\u2019s all happening in this administration because they cut funding and they cut interdiction. When I\u2019m President of the United States, we\u2019re going to use the National Guard and whatever sources we need to stop some of the drugs coming into America.

Now they have to try harder if they want to keep getting federal funds. Then we took comments, as we always do, and there were tens of thousands of comments as to how we ought to do it. That\u2019s what drug it out. Meanwhile, we started the \u2014 also in \u201993 to look into whether cigarettes were addictive enough for the Federal Food and Drug Administration to ban the ability of cigarette companies to advertise, market and distribute their products to our kids. No president had ever taken on the tobacco lobby before. I did. Senator Dole opposed me. He went down and made a speech to people who were on his side saying that I did the wrong thing. I think I did the right thing. On drugs, I have repeatedly said drugs are wrong and illegal and can kill you. We have strengthened enforcement, and everybody in San Diego knows we strengthened control of the border. We have done a lot more, and I hope we get a chance to talk about it."}

Social Security and Medicare are entirely different in terms of the financial stabilities. Let\u2019s talk about them separately. Social Security is stable until, as you pointed out, at least the third decade of the next century. But we\u2019d like to have a Social Security fund that has about 70 years of life instead of about 30 years of life. What we have to do is simply to make some adjustments to take account of the fact that the baby boomers, people like me, are bigger in number than the people that went just before us and the people that come just after us. And I think what we\u2019ll plainly do is what we did in 1983 when Senator Dole served, and this is something I think he did a good job on when he served on the Social Security commission and they made some modest changes in Social Security to make sure that it would be alive and well into the 21st century. And we will do that. It\u2019s obvious that there are certain things that have to be done and there are 50 or 60 different options, and a bipartisan commission to take it out of politics, will make recommendations and build support for the people. Medicare is different. Medicare needs help now. I have proposed a budget which would put ten years on the life of the Medicare trust fund. That\u2019s more than it\u2019s had a lot of the time in the last years. It would save a lot of money through more managed care, by giving more options, more preventative care and lowering the inflation rate and the prices we\u2019re paying providers without having the kind of big premium increases and out-of-pocket costs that the budget I vetoed would provide. Then that would give us ten years to do with Medicare what we\u2019re going to do with Social Security; have a bipartisan group look at what we have to do to save it when the baby boomers retire. But now we can, we ought to pass this budget now and put ten years on it right away so no one has to worry about it."}

This is a political year, and the President is playing politics with Medicare. After this year is over, we\u2019ll resolve it just as we did with Social Security in `83. It\u2019s a nonpartisan commission. Ronald Reagan got together with Tip O\u2019Neill and Howard Baker, two Republicans and one Democrat. They appointed a commission I was on that commission. We resolved, we rescued Social Security. We suggested \u2014 I think it has been over a year ago now \u2014 we do the same with Medicare, and the White House called it a gimmick. Now last week I guess it was Donna Shalala said well we\u2019ll cut Medicare a hundred billion and appoint a commission. It will probably have to be done by a commission. Take it out of politics. I think if I were a senior citizen I would be a little fed up with all these ads scaring seniors, scaring veterans and scaring students about education. When you don\u2019t have any ideas, you don\u2019t have any agenda, and all you have is fear, that\u2019s all you can use.

Not in an election year, sir. I told them in early \u201995. Senator Dole said 30 years ago he was one of 12 people who voted against Medicare and he was proud of it.

Took it three steps, twice we sent welfare reform to the president and he vetoed it. On the third time we sent welfare reform to the president he signed it but announced he would change it next year, and the vice president said they were going to do something else through the line item veto which I\u2019ve never understood, but that\u2019s sort of inside baseball. What we need to do is make certain we try to return people to work. And I\u2019m standing here as someone who, a long time ago as the county attorney in Russell, Kansas, one of our jobs every month was go through all the welfare checks and sign them. And three of those checks were my grandparents\u2019. So I know what it\u2019s like to have to look welfare head-on. Obviously some people are going to need help. This is the United States of America. You\u2019re not going to go without food and you\u2019re not going to go without medical care. This is America. But at the same time, if you want to get off Medicare, get back in the mainstream, we\u2019re going to provide jobs. We\u2019re going to say you have a five-year limit. You can be on welfare. You got two years to look for a job. We provided more money for daycare in the bill that passed the senate, was vetoed, then it came back and the president signed pretty much the same bill. But this is an important issue. I don\u2019t think we ought to be giving welfare payments to illegal immigrants. It puts a heavy burden on a state like \u2014 except for emergencies. It puts a heavy burden on a states like California. It costs California taxpayers 3 billion dollars a year."}

Let me say that this is one of the most important issues in the world to me. I started working on welfare reform in 1980 because I was sick of seeing people trapped in a system that was increasingly isolating them and making their kids more vulnerable to get in trouble. So I\u2019ve been working on it when I was a governor for a long time. When I became president I used the authority I had in this law to get out from certain federal rules to help states move people to work. We reduced the welfare rolls by 2 million already. Now, I\u2019ve got a plan with this new welfare reform law to work with the private sector, to give employees specific tax incentives to hire people off welfare, and to do some other things which will create more jobs in the private sector, at least a million, and move more people from welfare to work. It\u2019s very important. And I hope we get a chance to talk about this more. There\u2019s not a more important issue. I, I still remember a woman that I met ten years ago who said she wanted to get off welfare so her kids could tell, give an answer when they say, \u201cWhat does your mother do for a job?\u201d I met that woman again. She\u2019s got four kids. One\u2019s got a good job, one\u2019s studying to be a doctor. One\u2019s in technical school, one\u2019s an honor student in high school. I want to make more people like that woman, Lily Harden, so I\u2019ve got a plan to do it, and it\u2019s just beginning."}

Create more jobs and opportunities for people on and off welfare. We have other provisions. Less litigation. The trial lawyers, big supporters of the president. The trial lawyers, of course they like lawsuits, so every time they have a bill that they want vetoed, the president vetoes it for them. We\u2019ve got to understand in America that we\u2019ve got to have growth, create more jobs and more opportunities in the private sector. The president takes credit for all these people off welfare.

Part of my tax package which is paid for in my balanced budget plan would exempt up to half a million dollars in gains from people when they sell their homes, which I think is the biggest capital gains benefit we could give to most ordinary Americans. We also have capital gains now for people that invest in new small businesses and hold the investment for five years. It was part of our other economic plan. And these are things I think that will go a long way toward helping America build a stronger economy and a better tax system. I think the most important thing to emphasize, though, is that we also have to help people in other ways to build a strong economy and we can\u2019t have any tax cut that\u2019s not paid for. One of the big differences between Senator Dole and myself is that I told you how I\u2019m going to pay for every penny of the tax cuts I recommend and we\u2019ve worked hard to bring this deficit down and that\u2019s helped people in the real estate business because the interest rates are lower. We\u2019ve got home ownership at a 15-year high. We\u2019ve got this country going in the right direction. So we can have a tax cut but my priority would be to help the families who need it with child rearing and education and buying a first-time home and helping for health care costs. So from your business, helping in buying a first-time home, exempting the capital gains on the sale of the home would be the most important things that you asked about. Thank you, Pamela."}

That\u2019s the liberal approach. You know, give you a little tax cut, give you a couple of years, then make the tax increases go on forever. So the net tax increase in his plan\u2019s somewhere between 60 and 80 billion dollars. We have in the Dole-Kemp economic plan, unless unless your home\u2019s worth over 500,000 dollars. And if it is, I appreciate it congratulate you. But in any event, no tax. It\u2019s a good idea, they saw it, they picked it up and put it in theirs, but it\u2019s only temporary. Ours are permanent, ours is a good plan. Create jobs and opportunities. Capital gains rate, cut it in half, cut it 28 percent to 14 percent. There are 7 trillion dollars in assets locked up in America. If we cut the capital gains rate, I\u2019m told everyday, I had a letter from a former constituent in Kansas saying I want to sell property in California, put it in my business in Kansas, I can\u2019t, because the capital gains rate\u2019s too high. We need to get the economy going. That\u2019ll help social security. That\u2019ll create more jobs. That\u2019ll help people who want to get off welfare. It\u2019s the American way."}

That\u2019s why most experts say that this tax scheme will blow a huge hole in the deficit, raise interest rates and weaken the economy and that will take away all the benefits of the tax cut with a weaker economy.

And I have a lot of young people work in my office, work in my campaign. This is about America. This is about, somebody said earlier, one of the first questions, we\u2019re together. It\u2019s one America, one nation. I\u2019m looking at our economic plan because I\u2019m concerned about the future for young people. I\u2019m looking about drugs. The president has been AWOL for four years. I\u2019m looking about crime. He\u2019ll claim credit now for crime going down, but it happens because mayors and governors and others have brought crime down. Rudy Giuliani, Mayor of New York, brought crime down 25 percent just in New York City. Of course the president will take credit for that. My view is we want to find jobs and opportunities and education. This year the Republican Congress, as far as student loans went from 24 billion to 36 billion over the next six years. A 50 percent increase. The highest appropriation. 6 billion dollars for Pell Grants, very, very important. We also raised the amount of each Pell Grant. In our economic plan, the $500 child credit can be used for young people, rolled over and over and over, you, of course not this age, but if you have a child two years old, 7 percent interest would be worth about $18,000 by the time that child was ready for college."}

But because I still believe that there is some discrimination and that not everybody has an opportunity to prove they\u2019re qualified, I favor the right kind of Affirmative Action. I\u2019ve done more to eliminate Affirmative Action programs I didn\u2019t think were fair and tighten others up than my predecessors have, since affirmative action\u2019s been around. But I have also worked hard to give people a chance to prove that they are qualified. Let me just give you some examples. We\u2019ve doubled the number of loans from the small business administration, tripled the number of loans to women business people, no one unqualified, everybody had to meet the standards. We\u2019ve opened 260,000 new jobs in the military to women since I\u2019ve been president. But the joint chiefs say we\u2019re stronger and more confident and solid than ever. Let me give you another example of what I mean. To me, Affirmative Action is making that extra effort. It\u2019s sort of like what Senator Dole did when he sponsored the Americans with Disabilities Act and said to certain stores, okay, you have to make it accessible to people in wheelchairs. We weren\u2019t guaranteeing anything, anybody anything except the chance to prove they were qualified, the chance to prove that they could do it. And that\u2019s why I must say I agree with General Colin Powell that we\u2019re not there yet. We ought to keep making those extra effort Affirmative Action programs, the law and the policy of the land."}

This is America. No discrimination. Discrimination ought to be punished but there ought to be equal opportunity. We ought to reach out, make certain everybody has a chance to participate.

It shouldn\u2019t be that way. Now, the President can say well he wants to mend it, not end it. There are 168 federal programs that allow quotas. He ended one. Now, this economic package, Tim, I\u2019m glad you asked, because you look like the type that might be able to benefit from a 15 percent across- the-board tax cut and $500-per-child tax credit, or \u2014 you know, estate tax relief which you\u2019re not interested in right now, but capital gains rate reduction. If you\u2019re taking care of an elderly parent, you get a $1,000 deduction. We think that\u2019s very important because a lot of people take care of their parents. How do we pay for it? You can have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, which the President opposed and defeated. He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote with him and lost by one vote. We\u2019re going to balance the budget, by the year 2002. The President wants to spend 20 percent more in the next six years, and I want to spend 14 percent more and give that 6 percent back to the people. Remember, it\u2019s your money; it\u2019s not his money. And it\u2019s not my money. It\u2019s your money. And you shouldn\u2019t have to apologize for wanting to keep all you can of it.

I\u2019d like to say you can also take a little time off without losing your job to go to a regular parent-teacher conference or to go to a regular doctor\u2019s appointment with a family member. I\u2019d also like to see the overtime laws change so that we could have some more flex time so that at the discretion of the worker, the worker, if you earn overtime, you could decide when you want that time to be taken, in cash or in time with your family if you\u2019ve got a family problem. I never go anywhere, it seems like, where I don\u2019t meet somebody who has benefited from a Family Leave Law. In Longview, Texas the other day, I met a woman who was almost in tears because she had been able to keep her job while spending time with her husband who had cancer. One of the people who\u2019s here with me today met a woman in the airport saying her son, Jess was able to be present at the birth of her child because of the Family Leave Law. So yes, I think it should be expanded. We have to help people succeed at home and at work."}

We had a better idea. We didn\u2019t win. We had a better idea. Now we have a majority and we get a president. That was a tax credit for the employer. Instead of the federal government, we had that tax credit, pick up some of the costs, because if you have to hire a replacement worker, that\u2019s a cost. This is the way it ought to work, give more power back to the states and back to the people back to the taxpayers, not always the long arm of the federal government. But keep in mind this bill covers 5 percent of the employers, and 95 percent of the employers and all those employees they employ are not covered in this act. And according to Investors Daily, which I read just a couple of days ago, 88 percent of the people he claims credit for are already covered in collective bargaining agreements or other agreements. We had family leave in our office, I\u2019m certain. I see my friend Senator Mitchell. He had family leave. I work every day with people. I spend a lot of time in hospitals. I know what it\u2019s like to be in a hospital. Sure we want family leave. But there\u2019s a better way to do it."}

We\u2019ve lost 357,000 manufacturing jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics today said they made a mistake. It\u2019s probably going to take a much, much higher figure.

We\u2019re going to do that with an economic package. We\u2019re going to do that with regulatory reform. You know, regulations cost the average family right here, Democrat or Republican, about $7,000 a year. 7,000. That\u2019s like a tax. It\u2019s put a lot of people out of business. I met a lady in Colorado Springs about seven weeks ago now. She had a small business with 63 employees. She finally gave it up. Why? Because of paperwork and regulation. Congress passed a paperwork reduction act. The President exempts the IRS which creates three-fourths of the paperwork. We\u2019re going to have regulatory \u2014 we\u2019re gonna have litigation reform. You know, I fell off a platform out in California, Chico, a while back. Before I hit the ground, my cell phone rang and this trial lawyer said, I think we\u2019ve got a case here. (Laughter). We\u2019ve got to stop some of these frivolous lawsuits.

We lost a lot of manufacturing jobs in the 12 years before I became President. We\u2019ve gained manufacturing jobs since I\u2019ve been President. We\u2019ve negotiated over 200 separate trade agreements. Let\u2019s just take California. In California, we made 37 billion dollars\u2019 worth of telecommunications equipment eligible for export for the first time. We\u2019re selling everything from from \u2014 from telephones to CDs to rice in Japan. We\u2019re selling American automobiles in Japan now. I visited a Chrysler dealership in Japan. We\u2019re No.1 in automobile manufacturing production and sales around the world again, the first time since 1970s. Why? Because we\u2019ve had tough aggressive trade policies, and because we\u2019ve got interest rates down. We have a good, stable economic policy. Because we reduced the deficit four years in a row. For the first time in the 20th century the President has done that in all four years and that\u2019s why I don\u2019t want to see us blow a big hole in the deficit with a tax program we can\u2019t pay for, so your interest rates will go up, and you\u2019ll have to pay back in higher interest rates what you allegedly will get in a tax cut, so I say keep working on expanding the markets. More than half of these 10 and a half million new jobs are in higher wage areas and we\u2019ll have more manufacturing and sales around the world."}

They\u2019re setting new records this year. We had the worst economy in a century. We had the slowest growth, about 2.5 percent. The president inherited growth of over 5 percent. We don\u2019t have the S&L crisis anymore. Republicans have cut 53 billion dollars in spending, that\u2019s why the budget looked good.

I\u2019m for it. Now, I have a little time left so let me just say that I get attacked so many times on these questions; it\u2019s hard to answer these things. Senator Dole just said we had the worst economy in the century. In February he said we had the best economy in \u00c2 30 years, just February. And I don\u2019t want to respond in kind to all these things. I could. I could answer a lot of these things tit for tat. But I hope we can talk about what we\u2019re going to do in the future.

But I will get back to the economic package because, again, I think this is very important. If there\u2019s anything that\u2019s going to change America it\u2019s get the economy growing. The President inherited a good economy, sure the S&L crisis then were selling assets. Got a Republican Congress cutting spending finally and he said it\u2019s the best four years ever. That\u2019s not true. We had a 1.2 million bankruptcy, set a new record. Credit card debt has never been higher. I just told you about this manufacturing job loss which is going to increase.

In San Diego where we had some defense cutbacks, we funded a project for the University of California San Diego to use airplane composite materials to build lighter, stronger bridges, a little project in a program that Senator Dole opposed.

Everybody would have been forced into managed care. You couldn\u2019t have chosen your own doctor and that would have been the end. And I think right now we got to go back. I know they\u2019ve appointed a commission to take a look at managed care. Maybe that\u2019s part of the answer. But it seems to me if we start to take choices away from people and if we drive them into one type care, eliminate fee-for-service altogether or eliminate the fact you can go to your own doctor, you have to go somewhere else, then I think we\u2019ve taken a giant step backward in the United States of America. We have the best health care delivery system in the world and we want to keep it that way. That\u2019s why we opposed the government take over health care plan that President Clinton tried and tried and tried to get through Congress. Didn\u2019t get it done. And ended up we had more votes than he had, then they decided to pull the plug. It was a big, big mistake. Now whether or not he\u2019ll do that again I\u2019ve heard some of the people say, well, that\u2019s the model we ought to use and if he\u2019s reelected maybe he will come back and try it again. I hope not. I hope not in both cases. But it does seem to me that you\u2019ve raised a very important point that needs to be addressed. You\u2019re going to have to watch it. Gonna have to take a look at all the managed care going on in California, or we\u2019re going to end up losing our best care that we have in the world."}

Now that\u2019s not a government takeover. That\u2019s like the family of medical-leave law; it just tries to set the rules of the game. I\u2019m strongly in favor of a federal bill to repeal any gag rules on providers. In other words, I believe that doctors should not be able to be kicked out of managed care plans just because they tell the patients what they need and what more expensive care options might be. If we\u2019re saving money and managing resources better, that\u2019s a good thing. If we\u2019re saving money and depriving people of care, that\u2019s a bad thing. A good place to start is to say no managed care provider can gag a doctor and kick the doctor out of the managed care plan for the doctor, telling the patient, you need a more expensive test, you need a more expensive procedure, your health requires it."}

That\u2019s why I strongly supported the Motor Voter law. There was a big story I think in U.S.A. Today of the millions of people who have now registered because of it. Secondly, I think we need to look at making the elections more accessible. You know several states now are letting people vote over three weeks. A lot of people are busy and it\u2019s hard for them to just get there and vote. Third thing I think we need is more forums like this, which is one of the reasons I have so strongly supported campaign finance reform. Because if you want to cut the cost of campaigns, you have to open the airways, because what drives the cost of campaigns are the cost of advertising on television, radio, newspaper, mass mailing. And if you open the airways to more things like this, you see it\u2019s not just you that are participating here. For every one of you who stood up here and asked a question tonight, I promise you there\u2019s a 100,000 Americans who said I wish I could have asked that question. So I think we have to change the nature of politics. The last thing I think we should do is something I have been trying to do since I have been president, is every time I do something in a public way, I try to have a real American citizen there who is directly affected by it so that people can see the connection of what happens way across the country, in Washington with more police on the street, in San Diego, clean up the sewage here in San Diego, doubling the border guards here in Southern California, that there is a connection between what we do way back there and what we do here. Those are my best ideas about it."}

One vote doesn\u2019t make a difference.\u201d I can give you hundreds of \u2014 you can probably give me 200 cases where one vote made a difference. I know it made a lot of difference many times in the Congress. Campaign finance might help. It might help the contributions from coming in from Indonesia or other foreign countries, rich people in those countries, and then being sent back after the L.A. Times discovers it, $250,000. But maybe there ought to be more debates. I would be willing to have another debate this year. We can invite all the candidates. And talk about the economy. If we don\u2019t get the economy to grow, if we don\u2019t cut taxes, and give people child credits, and cut the capital gains rate, and get this economy growing, we\u2019re going to limp into the next century.

One of the things I think that really frustrates people is that so often political campaigns seem to be more about the politicians that are running than the people. And there is a connection. And I think what we have to do is convince people there is a big difference, if you vote one way you will have a Department of Education in the 21st century, if you vote the other way, you won\u2019t. If you vote one way you will have an expansion of family leave. If you vote the other way, you will be lucky to save it. But these are important questions. And people have to decide.

You can also use those accounts for health care or education or a first home. We\u2019re doing that precisely, and I think one thing sooner or later we\u2019re going to have to consider is take a look at the Social Security system. Because we\u2019ve got a lot of people advocating we don\u2019t want to put our money into Social Security. You have to be very careful of that because you have to protect the people who are already in the pipeline. It\u2019s something you might consider. I\u2019m not suggesting it will be done, but at least we ought to look at it. It\u2019s been looked, When I was chairman of the finance committee which handled Social Security we looked at all these options, and one thing we\u2019ve got to make certain, when I used to go home my mother would tell me all I\u2019ve got is my Social Security, don\u2019t touch it. And we didn\u2019t touch it. We preserved it. And I\u2019m an optimist. Your your Social Security is going to be there when you retire. We will fix it. It will probably happen in the year 2012 or 2015. In 1983 we thought we had a 75 -year fix. It didn\u2019t work. Much, much less, but at least we fixed it for some time and 37 to 40 million people get their checks on time. So we need to preserve the system. And we need to make it stronger. But we also need to look at some options, whether or not we \u2014 depending on what the options are. In fact, they have got a commission right now in Congress, a bipartisan commission, looking at all the different options they will present to the next Congress. so I think we will wait, see what they present, take a look at it."}

Only about half the people in this country have pension plans. And Social Security is not enough for a lot of people to live on, or at least is not enough for them to maintain anything like their previous lifestyle. So we\u2019ve got to figure out how are we going to have more people with pension plans, and pension coverage has been declining as more and more people work for small businesses and fewer people work for big businesses. So what, what is in my plan and I think it\u2019s almost identical in Senator Dole\u2019s plans is we make more people eligible to save in an IRA and let couples, married couples save more and then they could withdraw from it tax-free if they needed to, for medical emergencies or buy a home or education, but they could also save to supplement retirement. In addition to that, we just passed a sweeping small business reform that makes it easier for small business people to take out 401 K plans for themselves and employees and much easier for employees to carry it from job to job. My best friend from grade school is a computer software salesman and he told me last time he changed employers it took him nine months to figure out how to transfer his 401K plan. Now none of that will happen anymore. I hope over the next ten years you will see a big increase over the percentage of people that have pension plans, plus a secure Social Security system."}

We have concluded with Japan 21 \u2014 about to be 22 \u2014 trade agreements now. And since we did that, in the areas where we concluded, trade agreements or exports to Japan have gone up by 85 percent in the last four years and our trade deficit with Japan has gone down. Until about five months ago the Japanese economy was in a deep recession. It\u2019s coming back now, so they can buy even more American products, and I think it will go down more. But I\u2019m very \u2014 that\u2019s one of the real success stories here of the work we\u2019ve done. We\u2019re selling Japanese rice from California for the first time. I visited a Chrysler dealership in Tokyo. I visited a Jeep plant, oldest plant in America, a plant in Toledo, Ohio, where they\u2019re going to export 41,000 right hand drive Jeeps this year, and they\u2019ve got 700 new jobs because of it. There\u2019s no easy way to do this when you\u2019re dealing with an economy that\u2019s traditionally been more closed than one that\u2019s traditionally been more open. You have to gut it out, issue by issue by issue. We agreed in principle on an insurance agreement, and we\u2019re working on three or four other areas now, but the way you have to do it is make sure you\u2019re competitive. We\u2019re the most competitive country in the world now, and then just fight to open those markets and go try to make the sale, and that\u2019s what our trade ambassador our commerce secretary and all the other people in our administration are trying to do."}

And now what we have to do is to focus on those things we\u2019re real good at and make sure we\u2019re getting a fair deal. We just had a pretty serious dispute with China because they were copying our CDs, and costing thousands of jobs in places like California. So we have \u2014 as we said, if you want to keep doing business and selling your products over here, you\u2019re going to have to quit pirating our CDs, and they agreed to do things and verify that they had done it, which will make the problem much better. There is not a simple answer. You have to work on this day in and day out, every month ,every year, every issue, to make sure that we have not only free trade but fair trade. I\u2019m proud that we\u2019re better off on that than we were four years ago."}

You ought to make more decisions. Honor, duty, and country, that\u2019s what America is all about. Certainly the President of the United States, the highest office in the world, the most important office in the world, has a responsibility to young people, as we talked about earlier. To everyone. By example. And when it comes to public ethics, he has a responsibility. And you have 30-some in your administration, either left or being investigated or in jail or whatever, then you\u2019ve got an ethical problem. This is public ethics; I\u2019m not talking about private ethics. Talking about public ethics. When you have 900 files gathered up by some guy who is a bouncer in a bar and hired a security officer to collect files, in Watergate \u2014 I know a person who went to jail for looking at one file, one FBI file. There are 900 sequestered in the White House. 900. People like you. Why should they be rifling through your files? The president has a great responsibility. That\u2019s one that I understand and certainly will carry out."}

And yet, interestingly enough, we have the most religious freedom of any country in the world, including the freedom not to believe. And now we have all these people just up the road in Los Angeles County, we have people from 150 different racial and ethnic groups and tons of different religions, but the fundamental tenets of virtually every religion are the same, and what I try to do is to support policies that would respect religion and then help parents inculcate those values to their children. Let me very briefly give you some examples. One of my proudest moments was signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, that says the government has got to bend over backwards before we interfere with religious practice. So I changed the Justice Department\u2019s effort to get a church to pay back a man tithe, because he was bankrupt when he gave it. I have supported character education programs in our schools, drug-free schools programs. I supported giving parents a V-chip on their television so if they don\u2019t want their young kids to watch things they shouldn\u2019t watch, they wouldn\u2019t have to. That is the kind of thing we have to do, give people like you and our families the power to give those values to our children."}

I support it; the president opposes it. It seems to me the president, whoever the president may be, this is one of his highest responsibilities.

We don\u2019t need a constitutional amendment for kids to pray, and what I did was to have the justice department and the education department for the first time ever issue a set of guidelines that we gave to every school in America, saying that children could not be interfered with in religious advocacy when they were praying, when they were doing whatever they could do under the constitution, just because they were on a public school ground, and I think anyone who\u2019s experienced this will tell you that our administration has done more than any in years to clarify the freedom of religion in the public square, including in the public schools. Now, I think I have to let Senator Dole speak for himself. It wouldn\u2019t be fair for me to do that. I would wind up \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s the last question and I would mischaracterize it to try to make you happy. Let me tell you what I feel. We have a lot of differences in our country, and some of us believe that other people\u2019s decisions are wrong, even immoral. But under our constitution, if you show up tomorrow and obey the law, and you work hard and you do what you\u2019re supposed to do, you are entitled to equal treatment. That\u2019s the way the system works. All over the world, people are being torn apart \u2014 Bosnia, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Rwanda, Burundi \u2014 you name it \u2014 because of all their differences. We still have some of that hatred inside us. You see it in the church burnings. And one of the things I\u2019ve tried hardest to do is to tell the American people that we have to get beyond that, we have to understand that we\u2019re stronger when we unite around shared values instead of being divided by our differences."}

I said I\u2019m opposed to discrimination. You know we\u2019ve suffered discrimination in the disability community. There are 43 million of us. And I can recall cases where people would cross the street rather than meet somebody in a wheelchair. So we want to end discrimination. I think that answers itself. No discrimination in America. We\u2019ve made that clear. And I would just say that it seems to me that that\u2019s the way it ought to be. We shouldn\u2019t discriminate \u2014 race, color, whatever \u2014 life-style, disability. This is America. And we\u2019re all proud of it. But we\u2019re not there yet.

I\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t have a foreign policy question, because just this week Secretary Christopher said, \u201cWell, we really didn\u2019t know much the first couple of years about foreign policy.\u201d Now that was quite an admission. It underscores what I had to say in the Hartford debate, that there is really no foreign policy in this administration. It\u2019s sort of ad hoc, just whatever comes up, we\u2019ll deal with it. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t have more questions on that."}

All the people who may still be watching or viewing. This is what it\u2019s all about. It\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s not about President Clinton. It\u2019s about the process. It\u2019s about selecting a president of the United States. So we have our differences. We should have our differences. Mentioned other parties. They have their differences. We all agreed it would be a pretty dull place. We should have more debates. Maybe we will have another debate on the economy. But I would just say this. This is the highest honor that I have ever had in my life, to think that somebody from Russell, Kansas, somebody who grew up living in a basement apartment, someone whose parents didn\u2019t finish high school, somebody who spent about 39 months in hospitals after World War II, someone who uses a buttonhook every day to get dressed. Somebody who understands that there\u2019re real Americans out there with real problems, whether soccer moms, or the single parents, the families or the seniors, or people with disabilities, whoever it may be. There are some very fundamental differences in this campaign. President Clinton opposes term limits, President Clinton opposes a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. President Clinton opposes voluntary prayer amendment. Opposes an amendment to protect the flag of the United States of America. People give their lives. Couple of service men here. They sacrifice, they give everything for America. We ought to protect the American flag with a constitutional amendment. But beyond that we need to address the economy. I will just say my time is running out here. It\u2019s a very proud moment for me. What I want the voters to do is to make a decision. And I want them to be proud of their vote in the years ahead. Proud that they voted for the right candidate. Proud that they voted hopefully for me. And I\u2019ll just make you one promise, my word is good. Democrats and Republicans said Bob Dole\u2019s word is good. I keep my word. I promise you the economy is going to get better. We\u2019re going to have a good economic package.

And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and all the people who are watching. One thing I would like to say is I agree with what Senator Dole said. It\u2019s a remarkable thing in a country like ours, a man who grew up in Russell, Kansas, and one who was born to a widowed mother in Hope, Arkansas, could wind up running for president. Could have a chance to serve as president. First thing I want to say is thank you for giving me the chance to be president. This election is about two different visions about how we should go into the 21st Century. Would we be better off as I believe, working together to give each other the tools we need to make the most of our God-given potential, or are we better off saying, you\u2019re on your own? Would we be better off building that bridge to the future together so we can all walk across it or saying you can get across yourself? If you don\u2019t agree \u2014 leave this room with anything else tonight and if the people watching us don\u2019t leave with anything else, I hope you will leave with this. This is a real important election. The world is changing dramatically in how we work and how we live, how we relate to each other, huge changes. And the decisions we make will have enormous practical consequences. So we\u2019ve talked about our responsibility tonight. I want to talk about your responsibility, and your responsibility. Your responsibility is to show up on November the 5th. Because you\u2019re going to decide whether we\u2019re going to balance the budget now, but protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. You will decide whether we\u2019re going to keep fighting crime with a Brady Bill, assault weapons and finish putting those 100,000 police. Whether we\u2019re going to move a million people from welfare to work. Whether we\u2019re going to give our families more protection for their kids against drugs and tobacco and gangs and guns. Whether we\u2019re going to give our children a world-class education. Where every eight-year-old can read. Every 12-year-old can log in on the Internet. Every 18-year-old can go to college. If we do those things we will build that bridge to the 21st Century and the greatest country in history will be even greater. Thank you."}

This is a movement that came from the people. This is the way the framers of the Constitution intended our government to be, a government that comes from the people. Over time we have developed a government that comes at the people, that comes from the top down, where the people are more or less treated as objects to be programmed during the campaign with commercials and media events and fear messages and personal attacks and things of that nature. The thing that separates my candidacy and makes it unique is that this came from millions of people in 50 states all over this country who wanted a candidate that worked and belonged to nobody but them. I go into this race as their servant, and I belong to them. So this comes from the people."}

We saw that message in the late 70s when heard a lot about change, and what happened, that misery index went right through the roof. But my economic program is the kind of change we want. And the way we\u2019re going to get it done is we\u2019re going to have a brand new Congress. A lot of them are thrown out because of all the scandals. I\u2019ll sit down with them, Democrats and Republicans alike, and work for my agenda for American renewal, which represents real change.

Values, judgment, and the record that I have amassed in my state also should count for something. I\u2019ve worked hard to create good jobs and to educate people. My state now ranks first in the country in job growth this year, fourth in income growth, fourth in reduction of poverty, third in overall economic performance, according to a major news magazine. That\u2019s because we believe in investing in education and in jobs. And we have to change in this country. You know, my wife, Hillary, gave me a book about a year ago in which the author defined insanity as just doing the same old thing over and over again and expecting a different result. We have got to have the courage to change. Experience is important, yes. I\u2019ve gotten a lot of good experience in dealing with ordinary people over the last year and month. I\u2019ve touched more people\u2019s lives and seen more heartbreak and hope, more pain and more promise, than anybody else who\u2019s run for president this year. I think the American people deserve better than they\u2019re getting. We have gone from first to thirteenth in wages in the world in the last twelve years, since Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan have been in. Personal income has dropped while people have worked harder. In the last four years, there have been twice as many bankruptcies as new jobs created. We need a new approach. The same old experience is not relevant. We\u2019re living in a new world after the Cold War, and what works in this new world is not trickle down, not government for the benefit of the privileged few, not tax and spend, but a commitment to invest in American jobs and American education, controlling American health care costs, and bringing the American people together. That is what works. And you can have the right kind of experience and the wrong kind of experience. Mine is rooted in the real lives of real people, and it will bring real results if we have the courage to change."}

Now, I know that the only way he can win is to make everybody believe the economy\u2019s worse than it is. But this country is not coming apart at the seams, for heaven\u2019s sakes.

I want to give people permanent incentives on investment tax credit, like President Kennedy and the Congress inaugurated in the early \u201960s to get industry moving again; a research and development tax credit; a low-income housing tax credit; a long-term capital gains proposal for new business and business expansions. We\u2019ve got to have no more trickle down. We don\u2019t need across-the-board tax cuts for the wealthy for nothing. We need to say here\u2019s your tax incentive: if you create American jobs, the old-fashioned way. I\u2019d like to create more millionaires than were created under Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan, but I don\u2019t want to have 4 years where we have no growth in the private sector, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happened in the last 4 years. We\u2019re down 35,000 jobs in the private sector. We need to invest and grow, and that\u2019s what I want to do."}

What I don\u2019t accept is demonstrating and organizing demonstrations in a foreign country when your country\u2019s at war. I\u2019m sorry. I cannot accept that. In terms of this one on taxes spells out the biggest difference between us. I do not believe we need to go back to the Mondale proposals or the Dukakis proposals of tax and spend. Governor Clinton says $200,000 but he also says he wants to raise $150 billion. Taxing people over $200,000 will not get you $150 billion. And then when you add in his other spending proposals, regrettably you end up socking it to the working man. That old adage they use\u2013we\u2019re going to soak the rich- -we\u2019re going to soak the rich\u2013it always ends up being the poor cab driver or the working man that ends up paying the bill. And so I just have a different approach. I believe the way to get the deficit down is to control the growth of mandatory spending programs, and not raise taxes on the American people. We\u2019ve got a big difference there."}

If you look at the cost of not keeping the peace in Europe, it would be exorbitant. We have reduced the number of troops that are deployed and going to be deployed. I have cut defense spending. And the reason we could do that is because of our fantastic success in winning the Cold War. We never would have got there if we had gone for the nuclear freeze crowd; we never would have got there if we had listened to those that wanted to cut defense spending. I think it is important that the US stay in Europe and continue to guarantee the peace. We simply cannot pull back. Now, when anybody has a spending program they want to spend money on at home, they say, well, let\u2019s cut money out of the Defense Dept. I will accept and have accepted the recommendations of 2 proven leaders, General Colin Powell and Secretary Dick Cheney. They feel that the levels we\u2019re operating at and the reductions that I have proposed are proper. And so I simply do not think we should go back to the isolation days and starting blaming foreigners. We are the sole remaining superpower, and we should be that. And we have a certain disproportionate responsibility. But I would ask the American people to understand that if we make imprudent cuts, if we go too far, we risk the peace. And I don\u2019t want to do that. I\u2019ve seen what it is like to see a war, to see the burdens of a war, and I don\u2019t want to see us make reckless cuts. Because of our programs we have been able to significantly cut defense spending. But let\u2019s not cut into the muscle, and let\u2019s not cut down our insurance policy, which is participation of American forces in NATO, the greatest peace- keeping organization ever made. Today you\u2019ve got problems in Europe, still bubbling along even though Europe\u2019s gone democracy\u2019s route. But we are there, and I think this insurance policy is necessary. I think it goes with world leadership, and I think the levels we\u2019ve come up with are just about right."}

For example, Germany will spend a trillion dollars building infrastructure over the next 10 years. It\u2019s kind of easy to do if you only have to pick up a $30-billion tab to defend your country. The European Community is in a position to pay a lot more than they have in the past. I agree with the president: when they couldn\u2019t, we should have; now that they can, they should. We sort of seem to have a desire to try to stay over there and control it. They don\u2019t want us to control it, very candidly. So it I think is very important for us to let them assume more and more of the burden and for us to bring that money back here and rebuild our infrastructure, because we can only be a superpower if we are an economic superpower; and we can only be an economic superpower if we have a growing, expanding job base."}

There are certainly dangers there, there are certainly other trouble spots in the world which are closer to Europe than to the US. But 2 former defense secretaries recently issued a report saying that 100,000 or slightly fewer troops would be enough, including President Reagan\u2019s former defense secretary, Mr. Carlucci. Many of the military experts whom I consulted on this agreed. We\u2019re going to have to spend more money in the future on military technology and on greater mobility, greater airlift, greater sealift, the B-22 airplane. We\u2019re going to have to do some things that are quite costly. And I simply don\u2019t believe we can afford nor do we need to keep 150,000 troops in Europe given how much the Red Army, now under the control of Russia, has been cut, the arms control agreement concluded between Mr. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin, something I have applauded. I don\u2019t think we need 150,000 troops. Let me make one other point. Mr. Bush talked about taxes. He didn\u2019t tell you that he vetoed a middle class tax cut because it would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy and vetoed an investment tax credit paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy."}

People are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago, 2- 3rds of our people\u2013a $1600 drop in average income in just the last 2 years.

That\u2019s why I think we shouldn\u2019t do it that quickly. We have a disciplined reduction in the deficit of 50 % over the next 4 years, but first get incentives to invest in this economy, put the American people back to work.

I would simply say to her, look, take a look at what the president has proposed on job retraining. When you cut back on defense spending, some people are going to be thrown out of work. If you throw another 50,000 kids on the street because of cutting recklessly in troop levels, you\u2019re going to put a lot more out of work. I would say to them, look at the job retraining programs that we\u2019re proposing. Therein is the best answer to her. And another one is: stimulate investment and savings. I mean, we\u2019ve got big economic problems, but we are not coming apart at the seams; we\u2019re ready for a recovery. With interest rates down and inflation down, the cruelest tax of all, caught up in a global slowdown right now, that that will change if you go with the programs I\u2019ve talked about and if you help with job retraining and education. I am a firm believer that our America 2000 education problem is the answer\u2013a little longer run; it\u2019s going to take awhile to educate. But it is a good program. So her best help for short term is job retraining, if she was thrown out of work at a defense plant. But tell her it\u2019s not all that gloomy; we\u2019re the US, we faced tough problems before. Look at the misery index when the Democrats had both the White House and the Congress. It was just right through the roof. Now, we can do better.

So we have two that I\u2019d put as number one. I have number 1 and 1A. One is we\u2019ve got to have the money to be able to pay for defense, and we\u2019ve got to manufacture here. Believe it or not folks, you can\u2019t ship it all overseas, you\u2019ve got to make it here. And you can\u2019t convert from potato chips to airplanes in an emergency. See, Willow Run could be converted from cars to airplanes in World War II because it was here. We\u2019ve got to make things here. You can\u2019t ship them overseas anymore. I hope we can talk more about that. Second thing, on priorities. We\u2019ve got to help Russia succeed in its revolution and all of its republics. When we think of Russia, remember we\u2019re thinking of many countries, now. We\u2019ve got to help them. That\u2019s pennies on the dollar compared to renewing the cold war. Third, we\u2019ve got all kinds of agreements on paper, and some that are being executed on getting rid of nuclear warheads. Russia and its republics are out of control or at best in weak control right now. It\u2019s a very unstable situation. You\u2019ve got every rich Middle Eastern country over there trying to buy nuclear weapons. As you well know. And that will lead to another five star migraine headache down the road. We really need to nail down the big intercontinental ballistic missiles, the ones that can hit us from Russia. And we\u2019ve focused on the tactical. We\u2019ve made real progress there. We\u2019ve got some agreement on the nuclear, but we don\u2019t have those things put away yet. The sooner the better. So, in terms of priorities, we\u2019ve got to be financially strong. Number two, we\u2019ve got to take care of this missile situation and try to get the nuclear war behind us and give this thing very high priority. And number three, we need to help and support Russia and the republics in every possible way to become democratic capitalistic societies, and not just sit back and let those countries continue in turmoil. Because they could go back worse than things used to be. And believe me there are a lot of old boys in the K.G.B. and the military that liked it better the way it used to be."}

There are three fundamental challenges. First of all, the world is still a dangerous and uncertain place. We need a new military and a new national security policy equal to the challenges of a post cold war era, a smaller permanent military force, but one that is more mobile, well trained with high technology equipment. We need to continue the negotiations to reduce the nuclear arsenals in the Soviet Union, the former Soviet Union, and the United States. We need to stop this proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Second, we have to face that in this world, economic security is a whole lot of national security. Our dollar\u2019s at an all time low against some foreign currencies. We\u2019re weak in the world. We must rebuild America\u2019s strength at home. And finally, we ought to be promoting the democratic impulses around the world. Democracies are our partners. They don\u2019t go to war with each other. They\u2019re reliable friends in the future.

Our exports are dramatically up. I might say to Mr. Perot, I can understand why you might have missed it, because there\u2019s so much fascination with trivia, but I worked out a deal with Boris Yeltsin to eliminate, get rid of entirely, the most destabilizing weapons of all, the SS-18, the intercontinental ballistic missile. I mean, that\u2019s been done. And thank God, it has, because the parents of these young people around here go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war. We made dramatic progress. And so, we\u2019ve got a good military. the question, to sort of get a new military, get the best in the world, we got it, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re keeping the peace, and they\u2019re respected around the world. And we\u2019re more respected because of the way we have conducted ourselves. We didn\u2019t listen to the nuclear freeze crowd. We said, \u201cPeace through strength,\u201d and it worked and the cold war is over. And America understands that. But we\u2019re so, turned so inward we don\u2019t understand the global picture. And we are helping democracy, Ross. The Freedom Support Act is something I got through the Congress, and it\u2019s a very good thing, because it does exactly what you say, and I think you agree with that, to help Russian democracy.

Mr Bush sent two people in secret to toast the Chinese leaders and basically tell them not to worry about it. They rewarded him by opening negotiations with Iran to transfer nuclear technology. That was their response to that sort of action. Now that the voices in the Congress and throughout the country have insisted that we do something about China, look at what has happened. China has finally agreed to stop sending us products made with prison labor. Not because we coddled them, but because the Administration was pushed into doing something about it. And recently the Chinese have announced they are going to lower some barriers to our products, which they ought to do since they have a 15 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States under Mr. Bush. The second biggest surplus next to Japan. So I would be firm. I would say if you want to continue as Most Favored Nation status for your government owned industries as well as your private ones, observe human rights in the future. Open your society. Recognize the legitimacy of those kids that were carrying the Statue of Liberty. If we can stand up for our economics, we ought to be able to preserve the democratic interests of the people of China.

To do what the Congress and Governor Clinton is suggesting, you\u2019d isolate and ruin Hong Kong. They are making some progress, not enough for us. We were the first ones to put sanctions on. We still have them on, on some things. But Governor Clinton\u2019s philosophy is isolate them. He says don\u2019t do it, but the policies he\u2019s expounding of putting conditions on M.F.N. and kind of humiliating them is not the way you make the kind of progress we are getting. And I\u2019ve stood up with these people, and I understand what you have to do to be strong in this situation, and it\u2019s moving, not as fast as we\u2019d like.

But time is our friend there, because their leaders will change in not too many years, worst case, and their country is making great progress. One last point on the missiles. I don\u2019t want the American people to be confused. We have written agreements and we have some missiles that have been destroyed, but we have a huge number of intercontinental ballistic missiles that are still in place in Russia. The fact that you have an agreement is one thing. Till they\u2019re destroyed, some crazy person can either sell them or use them."}

American airplanes are helping today on humanitarian relief for Sarajevo. It is America that\u2019s in the lead in helping with humanitarian relief for Somalia. But when you go to put somebody else\u2019s son or daughter into war, I think you got to be a little bit careful and you have to be sure that there\u2019s a military plan that can do this. You have ancient ethnic rivalries that have cropped up as Yugoslavia\u2019s dissolved or getting dissolved, and it isn\u2019t going to be solved by sending in the 82nd Airborne, and I\u2019m not going to do that as commander-in-chief. I am going to stand by and use the moral persuasion of the US to get satisfaction in terms of prison camps, and we\u2019re making some progress there, and in terms of getting humanitarian relief in there.

That\u2019s one thing I learned by forging that tremendous and greatly\u2013highly successful coalition against Saddam Hussein, the dictator. Use\u2013work internationally to do it.

It\u2019s very unlike World War II, when FDR\u2019s sons flew missions. Everybody went. It\u2019s a different world now.

There are, after all, 2 million refugees now because of the problems in what was Yugoslavia, the largest number since World War II, and there may be hundreds of thousands of people who will starve or freeze to death in this winter. The US should try to work with its allies and stop it. I urged the president to support this air cover, and he did\u2013and I applaud that. I applaud the no-fly zone, and I know that he\u2019s going back to the United Nations to try to get authority to enforce it. I think we should stiffen the embargo on the Belgrade government, and I think we have to consider whether or not we should lift the arms embargo now on the Bosnians, since they are in no way in a fair fight with a heavily armed opponent bent on ethnic cleansing.

A good family is a place where love and discipline and good values are transmuted (sic) from the elders to the children, a place where people turn for refuge, and where they know they\u2019re the most important people in the world. America has a lot of families that are in trouble today. There\u2019s been a lot of talk about family values in this campaign. I know a lot about that. I was born to a widowed mother who gave me family values, and grandparents. I\u2019ve seen the family values of my people in Arkansas. I\u2019ve seen the family values of all these people in America who are out there killing themselves working harder for less in a country that\u2019s had the worst economic years in 50 years and the first decline in industrial production ever. I think the president owes it to family values to show that he values America\u2019s families, whether they\u2019re people on welfare you\u2019re trying to move from welfare to work, the working poor whom I think deserve a tax break to lift them above poverty if they\u2019ve got a child in the house and working 40 hours a week, working families who deserve a fair tax system and the opportunity for constant retraining; they deserve a strong economy. And I think they deserve a family and medical leave act. Seventy-two other nations have been able to do it. Mr. Bush vetoed it twice because he says we can\u2019t do something seventy-two other countries do, even though there was a small business exemption. So with all the talk about family values, I know about family values \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t be here without them. The best expression of my family values is that tonight\u2019s my 17th wedding anniversary, and I\u2019d like to close my question by just wishing my wife a happy anniversary, and thank you, my daughter, for being here."}

I believe that discipline and respect for the law \u2014 all of these things should be taught to children, not in our schools, but families have to do that. I\u2019m appalled at the highest outrageous numbers of divorces \u2014 it happens in families, it\u2019s happened in ours. But it\u2019s gotten too much.

If we have children who are not surrounded with love and affection \u2014 you see, I look at my grandchildren and wonder if they\u2019ll ever learn to walk because they\u2019re always in someone\u2019s arms.

The use of cocaine, for example, by teenagers is dramatically down. But we\u2019ve got to keep fighting on this war against drugs. We\u2019re doing a little better in interdiction.

I\u2019ll tell the American people, but this man said I\u2019ll get you a million dollars a day in pro bono advertising, something that\u2019s very hard for the government to do.

What should we do? First, we ought to prevent more of this on the street. Thirty years ago, there were three policemen for every crime. Now there are three crimes for every policeman. We need a hundred thousand more police on the street. I have a plan for that. Secondly, we ought to have treatment on demand. Thirdly, we ought to have boot camps for first-time nonviolent offenders so they can get discipline and treatment and education and get reconnected to the community before they\u2019re severed and sent to prison, where they can learn how to be first class criminals.

But maybe you meant that some in the country don\u2019t have the will to fight it, but those that are out there on the front line, as you know \u2014 you\u2019ve been a strong backer of law enforcement \u2014 really \u2014 I just want to clear that up \u2013have the will to fight it, and, frankly, some of them are giving their lives."}

We have increased funding for AIDS. We\u2019ve doubled it on research and on every other aspect of it. My request for this year was $4.9 billion for AIDS \u2014 ten times as much per AIDS victim as per cancer victim. I think that we\u2019re showing the proper compassion and concern. So I can\u2019t tell you where it\u2019s coming from, but I am very much concerned about AIDS and I believe that we\u2019ve got the best researchers in the world out there at NIH working the problem. We\u2019re funding them \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 I wish there was more money \u2014 but we\u2019re funding them far more than any time in the past, and we\u2019re going to keep on doing that. I don\u2019t know. I was a little disappointed in Magic because he came to me and I said, \u201cNow if you see something we\u2019re not doing, get ahold of me. Call me, let me know.\u201d He went to one meeting, and then we heard that he was stepping down. So he\u2019s replaced by Mary Fisher who electrified the Republican Convention by talking about the compassion and the concern that we feel. It was a beautiful moment and I think she\u2019ll do a first-class job on that commission. So I think the appeal is yes, we care. And the other thing is part of AIDS \u2014 it\u2019s one of the few diseases where behavior matters. And I once called on somebody, \u201cWell, change your behavior. Is the behavior you\u2019re using prone to cause AIDS? Change the behavior.\u201d Next thing I know, one of these ACT UP groups is out saying, \u201cBush ought to change his behavior.\u201d You can\u2019t talk about it rationally. The extremes are hurting the AIDS cause. To go into a Catholic mass in a beautiful cathedral in New York under the cause of helping in AIDS and start throwing condoms around in the mass, I\u2019m sorry, I think it sets back the cause. We cannot move to the extreme. We\u2019ve got to care. We\u2019ve got to continue everything we can at the federal and the local level. Barbara I think is doing a superb job in destroying the myth about AIDS. And all of us are in this fight together, all of us care. Do not go to the extreme."}

Then I would really focus on let\u2019s get these things out. If you\u2019re going to die, you don\u2019t have to go through this ten-year cycle that FDA goes through on new drugs. Believe me, people with AIDS are more than willing to take that risk. And we could be moving out to the human population a whole lot faster than we are on some of these new drugs. So I would think we can expedite the problem there. Let me go back a minute to racial divisiveness. The all- time low in our country was the Judge Thomas-Anita Hill hearings, and those senators ought to be hanging their heads in shame for what they did there. 2nd thing, there are not many times in your life when you get to talk to a whole country.

I have worked in my state to reduce teen pregnancy and illness among children. I know it\u2019s tough. The reason Magic Johnson resigned from the AIDS Commission is because the statement you heard tonight from Mr. Bush is the longest and best statement he\u2019s made about it in public.

They will want to do what\u2019s good for our country. Now, all these fellows with thousand-dollar suits and alligator shoes running up and down the halls of Congress that make policy now \u2014 the lobbyists, the PAC guys, the foreign lobbyists, and what-have-you, they\u2019ll be over there in the Smithsonian, you know \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 because we\u2019re going to get rid of them, and the Congress will be listening to the people.

(Laughter) I mean, look at the facts. Both parties in Washington, the president and the Congress, have cut Medicare. The average senior citizen is spending a higher percentage of income on health care today than they were in 1965, before Medicare came in. The president\u2019s got another proposal to require them to pay $400 a year more for the next 5 years. But if you don\u2019t have the guts to control costs by changing the insurance system and taking on the bureaucracies and the regulation of health care in the private and public sector, you can\u2019t fix this problem. Costs will continue to spiral. And just remember this, folks. A lot of folks on Medicare are out there every day making the choice between food and medicine; not poor enough for Medicare-Medicaid, not wealthy enough to buy their medicine. I\u2019ve met them, people like Mary Annie and Edward Davis in Nashua, New Hampshire. All over this country, they cannot even buy medicine. So let\u2019s be careful. When we talk about cutting health care costs, let\u2019s start with the insurance companies and the people that are making a killing instead of making our people healthy."}

They started it again. I\u2019m the president that stood up and said, don\u2019t mess with Social Security, and I\u2019m not going to and we haven\u2019t and we are not going to go after the Social Security recipient. I have one difference with Mr. Perot on that because I don\u2019t think we need to touch Social Security. What we do need to do, though, is control the growth of these mandatory programs. And Ross properly says, okay, there\u2019s some pain in that. But Governor Clinton refuses to touch that, simply refuses. So what we\u2019ve got to do is control it, let it grow for inflation, let it grow for the amount of new people added, population, and then hold the line. And I believe that is the way you get the deficit down, not by the tax-and-spend program that we hear every 4 years, whether it\u2019s Mondale, Dukakis, whoever else it is. I just don\u2019t believe we ought to do that. So hold the line on Social Security and put a cap on the growth of the mandatory program."}

Let me go back to the main point, Sandy. Mr. Bush is trying to run against Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter and everybody in the world but me in this race. I have proposed a managed competition plan for health care. I will say again - you cannot control health care costs simply by cutting Medicare. Look what\u2019s happened. The federal government has cut Medicare and Medicaid in the last few years, states have cut Medicaid \u2014 we\u2019ve done it in Arkansas under budget pressures. But what happens? More and more people get on the rolls as poverty increases. If you don\u2019t control the health care costs of the entire system, you cannot get control of it. Look at our program. We set up a national ceiling on health care costs tied to inflation and population growth set by health care providers, not by the government. We provide for managed competition, not government models, in every states. And we control private and public health care costs. Now, just a few days ago a bipartisan commission of Republicans and Democrats \u2014 more Republicans than Democrats \u2014 said my plan will save the average family $1200 a year more than the Bush plan will by the year 2000, $2.2 trillion in the next 12 years, $400 billion a year by the end of this decade. I\u2019ve got a plan to control health care costs. But you can\u2019t just do it by cutting Medicare; you have to take on the insurance companies, the bureaucracies. And you have to have cost controls, yes. But keep in mind we are spending 30% more on health care than any country in the world, any country, and yet we have 35 million people uninsured, we have no preventing and primary care. The Oregon plan is a good start if the federal government is going to continue to abandon its responsibilities. I say if Germany can cover everybody and keep costs under inflation, if Hawaii can cover 98% of their people at lower health care costs than the rest of us, if Rochester, New York, can do it with two-thirds of the cost of the rest of it, America can do it, too. I\u2019m tired of being told we can\u2019t. I say we can. We can do better, and we must."}

The Oregon plan made some good sense, but it\u2019s easy to dismiss the concerns of the disabled. As president I have to be sure that those waivers, which we\u2019re approving all over the place, are covered under the law. Maybe we can work it out. But the Americans with Disabilities Act, speaking about sound and sensible civil rights legislation, was the most foremost piece of legislation passed in modern times, and so we do have something more than a technical problem. Governor Clinton clicked off the things \u2014 he\u2019s going to take on insurance companies and bureaucracies. He failed to take on somebody else \u2014 the malpractice suit people, those that bring these lawsuits against \u2014 these frivolous trial lawyers\u2019 lawsuits that are running the costs of medical care up 25 to 50 billion. And he refuses to put anything, controls, on these crazy lawsuits. If you want to help somebody, don\u2019t run the costs up by making doctors have to have 5 or 6 tests where one would do for fear of being sued, or have somebody along the highway not stop to pick up a guy and help him because he\u2019s afraid a trial lawyer will come along and sue him.

I don\u2019t like to see the people in a deteriorating economy in a deteriorating country because our government has lost touch with the people. The people in Washington are good people.

Aren\u2019t you sick of being treated like an unprogrammed robot? Every 4 years, they send you all kinds of messages to tell you how to vote and then go back to business as usual. They told you at the tax and budget summit that if you agreed to a tax increase, we could balance the budget. They didn\u2019t tell you that that same year they increased spending $1.83 for every dollar we increased taxes. That\u2019s Washington in a nutshell right there. In the final analysis, I\u2019m doing this for your children when you look at them tonight. There\u2019s another group that I feel very close to, and these at the men and women who fought on the battlefield, the children \u2014 the families \u2014 of the ones who died and the people who left parts of their bodies over there.

This debate tonight has made crystal clear a challenge that is as old as America \u2014 the choice between hope and fear, change or more of the same, the courage to move into a new tomorrow or to listen to the crowd who says things could be worse. Mr. Bush has said some very compelling things tonight that don\u2019t quite square with the record. He was president for 3 years before he proposed a health care plan that still hasn\u2019t been sent to Congress in total; three years before an economic plan, and he still didn\u2019t say tonight that that tax bill he vetoed raised taxes only on the rich and gave the rest of you a break \u2014 but he vetoed it anyway.

In the Oval Office, you can\u2019t predict what kind of crisis is going to come up. You have to make tough calls. You can\u2019t be on one hand this way and one hand another. You can\u2019t take different positions on these difficult issues. And then you need a philosophical \u2014 I\u2019d call it a philosophical underpinning. Mine for foreign affairs is democracy and freedom, and look at the dramatic changes around the world. The Cold War is over. The Soviet Union is no more and we\u2019re working with a democratic country. Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the Baltics are free. Take a look at the Middle East. We had to stand up against a tyrant. The US came together as we haven\u2019t in many, many years. And we kicked this man out of Kuwait. And in the process, as a result of that will and that decision and that toughness, we now have ancient enemies talking peace in the Middle East. Nobody would have dreamed it possible. And I think the biggest dividend of making these tough calls is the fact that we are less afraid of nuclear war. Every parent out there has much less worry that their kids are going to be faced with nuclear holocaust. All this is good. On the domestic side, what we must do is have change that empowers people \u2014 not change for the sake of change, tax and spend. We don\u2019t need to do that any more. What we need to do is empower people. We need to invest and save. We need to do better in education. We need to do better in job retraining. We need to expand our exports, and they\u2019re going very, very well, indeed. And we need to strengthen the American family. I hope as president that I\u2019ve earned your trust. I\u2019ve admitted it when I make a mistake, but then I go on and help, try to solve the problems. I hope I\u2019ve earned your trust because a lot of being president is about trust and character. And I ask for your support for 4 more years to finish this job. Thank you very, very much."}

This is 1992, Bill Clinton is running against President George Bush. There are 2 things that I\u2019m going to stress during this debate: one, Bill Clinton\u2019s economic plan and his agenda will make matters much, much worse \u2014 he will raise your taxes, he will increase spending, he will make government bigger, jobs will be lost; second, Bill Clinton does not have the strength nor the character to be president of the US. Let us look at the agendas. President Bush wants to hold the line on taxes, Bill Clinton wants to raise taxes. President Bush is for a balanced budget amendment, Bill Clinton is opposed to it. We want to reform the legal system because it\u2019s too costly, Bill Clinton wants the status quo. We want to reform the health care system, Bill Clinton wants to ration health care. Bill Clinton wants to empower government, we want to empower people. In St. Louis, Missouri, in June of this year, Bill Clinton said this - \u201cAmerica is the mockery of the world.\u201d He is wrong. At some time during these next 4 years there is going to be a crisis \u2014 there will be an international crisis. I can\u2019t tell you where it\u2019s going to be, I can\u2019t even tell you the circumstances \u2014 but it will happen. We need a president who has the experience, who has been tested, who has the integrity and qualifications to handle the crisis. The president has been tested, the president has the integrity and the character. The choice is yours. You need to have a president you can trust. Can you really trust Bill Clinton?"}

Thirty-seven years in the Navy, and only one of them up there in Washington. And now I\u2019m an academic. The centerpiece of my life was the Vietnam War. I was there the day it started. I led the first bombing raid against North Vietnam. I was there the day it ended, and I was there for everything in between. Ten years in Vietnam, aerial combat, and torture. I know things about the Vietnam War better than anybody in the world. I know some things about the Vietnam War better than anybody in the world. And I know how governments, how American governments can be \u2014 can be courageous, and how they can be callow. And that\u2019s important. That\u2019s one thing I\u2019m an insider on.

Qualifications. I\u2019ve been there, Hal. I\u2019ve done the job. I\u2019ve been tested. I\u2019ve been vice president for 4 years. Senator Gore referred to us being elected to the Congress together in 1976. I\u2019ve done the job. I\u2019ve done many things for the president. But even as vice president you never know exactly what your role is going to be from time to time, and let me just give you an example of where I was tested under fire and in a crisis. President Bush was flying to Malta in 1989 to meet with President Gorbachev. It was the first meeting between President Bush and President Gorbachev. They had known each other before. A coup broke out in the Philippines. I had to go to the situation room. I had to assemble the president\u2019s advisers. I talked to President Aquino. I made the recommendation to the president. The president made the decision, the coup was suppressed, democracy continued in the Philippines, the situation was ended. I\u2019ve been there. And I\u2019ll tell you one other thing that qualifies you for being president \u2014 and it\u2019s this, Hal \u2014 you\u2019ve got to stand up for what you believe in. And nobody has ever criticized me for not having strong beliefs."}

The experience that George Bush and Dan Quayle have been talking about includes the worst economic performance since the Great Depression. Unemployment is up, personal income is down, bankruptcies are up, housing starts are down. How long can we continue with trickle-down economics when the record of failure is so abundantly clear? Discussions of the vice presidency tend sometimes to focus on the crisis during which a vice president is thrust into the Oval Office, and indeed, one-3rd of the vice presidents who have served have been moved into the White House. But the teamwork and partnership beforehand \u2014 and hopefully that situation never happens \u2014 how you work together is critically important.

By contrast, in the nation as a whole, during the last 4 years, it is the first time since the presidency of Herbert Hoover, that we have gone for a 4-year period with fewer jobs at the end of that 4-year period than we had at the beginning.

Bill Clinton and I have a detailed 5-year budget plan to create good jobs, cut the budget deficit in half, and eliminate the investment deficit in order to get our economy moving forward again. We have a $20-billion infrastructure fund to create a nationwide network of high-speed rail, for example, and what are called information superhighways to open up a whole universe of knowledge for our young people and to help our universities and companies that rely on new advances in the information revolution. We also have tax incentives for investment in job-creating activities, not the kind of encouragement for short-term rip-offs like the proposal that we have had from George Bush. But I want to return and say one more time - you have used our tax dollars to subsidize the recruitment of US companies to move overseas and throw Americans out of work. In Decaturville, Tennessee, not very far from my home, a factory was shut down right there when they were solicited by officials paid with US taxpayers\u2019 money, and then the replacement workers in a foreign country were trained with our tax dollars and then their imports were subsidized coming back into the US.

For example, George Bush wants to maintain at least 150,000 American soldiers in Europe, even though World War II ended 50 years ago. Bill Clinton and I agree with so many military experts who believe that it is time for the Europeans, who are so much wealthier now and more powerful than they were at the end of World War II to start picking up a little more of that tab themselves and not rely so exclusively on the US taxpayers for the defense of Europe. We believe that we can make savings in our defense budget and at the same time, improve our national security. Now, for those who are affected by the cutbacks, whether they come from George Bush or Bill Clinton and me \u2014 the difference is, Bill Clinton and I have a defense conversion program so that those who won the Cold War will not be left out in the cold.

If you would have supported that attitude \u2014 if you would have supported that attitude, we would not have won the Cold War. We won the Cold War because we invested and we went forward."}

Now when I heard George Bush say at the convention in Houston, that when he heard the phrase \u201cwe won the Cold War,\u201d it made him wonder who the \u201cwe\u201d was. Well, I want to tell you, President Bush, the \u201cwe\u201d is the people of the US of America. This wasn\u2019t a partisan victory that came suddenly, a few months after you took the oath of office. This started with Harry Truman and it was a bipartisan effort from the very beginning. George Bush taking credit for the Berlin Wall coming down is like the rooster taking credit for the sunrise. And I want to, I want to add \u2014 I want to add one other thing, because in the debate a few nights ago, I think President Bush made a very serious misstatement of fact in response to Ross Perot. It was kind of a little lecture he gave to Ross Perot when he said those SS-18s are gone, Ross, that\u2019s done. He \u2014 he reached a deal with Boris Yeltsin to completely remove them so we can all sleep safely without any fear tonight. But you know what? They thought they were going to get that deal, but when he took the person in charge of the negotiations out of the State Dept and put him in charge of the reelection campaign, the deal unraveled and now there is no START II deal at all. In fact there are serious problems. Isn\u2019t it a fact, Dan, that every single one of those SS-18s is still there, in the silos, and under the START I treaty, only half of the silos are supposed to be dismantled, and there is no deal to get rid of the other half?

What I have called upon is a cooperative effort by the US and Europe and Asia to work together in opening up new markets throughout the world for the new technologies that are necessary in order to reconcile the imperatives of economic progress with the imperatives of environmental protection. Take Mexico City for an example. They are shutting down factories right now, not because of their economy, but because they\u2019re choking to death on the air pollution. They\u2019re banning automobiles some days of the week. Now what they want is not new laser-guided missile systems. What they want are new engines and new factories and new products that don\u2019t pollute the air and the water, but nevertheless allow them to have a decent standard of living for their people. Last year 35 % of our exports went to developing countries, countries where the population is expanding worldwide by as much as one billion people every ten years. We cannot stick our heads in the sand and pretend that we don\u2019t face a global environmental crisis, nor should we assume that it\u2019s going to cost jobs. Quite the contrary. We are going to be able to create jobs as Japan and Germany are planning to do right now, if we have the guts to leave. Now earlier we heard about the auto industry and the timber industry. There have been 250,000 jobs lost in the automobile industry during the Reagan-Bush-Quayle years. There have been tens of thousands of jobs lost in the timber industry. What they like to do is point the finger of blame with one hand and hand out pink slips with the other hand. They\u2019ve done a poor job both with the economy and the environment.

The reason we are pro-choice and in favor of a woman\u2019s right to privacy is because we believe that during the early stages of a pregnancy the government has no business coming in and ordering a woman to do what the government thinks is best. What Dan Quayle and George Bush and Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson think is the right decision in a given set of circumstances is their privilege \u2014 but don\u2019t have the government order a woman to do what they think is the right thing to do. We ought to be able to build more common ground among those who describe themselves as pro-choice and pro-life in efforts to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies.

The \u2014 starting at, you know, for the last, almost a decade, we\u2019ve worried about our schools officially through Washington, and the president had a meeting of all the governors, and then they tried the conventional fixes for schools, that is, to increase the certification of \u2014 requirements for the teachers, to lengthen the school day, to lengthen the school year and nothing \u2014 this is a very brief overview of the thing \u2014 but nothing happened. And it\u2019s time to change the school\u2019s structure. In schools, bureaucracy is bad and autonomy is good. The only good schools \u2014 \u2014 we have are those run by talented principals and devoted teachers, and they\u2019re running their own show. How many times have I thrived? You know, the best thing I had when I ran that civilization, it succeeded, and it\u2019s a landmark. The best thing I had going for me was I had no contact with Washington for all those years."}

Sure, you have to know where you\u2019re going with your government, but character is the big variable in the success. Character of the leaders is the big variable in the success \u2014 long term success \u2014 of an administration. I went to a friend of mine in New York some years ago and he was a president of a major TV network and he said, you know, I think we have messed up this whole \u2014 this election process \u2014 it was an election year \u2014 by stressing that \u2014 putting out the dogma that issues are the thing to talk about, not character. He said, I felt so strongly about this, I went back and read the Lincoln-Douglas debates. Read those debates. How do they come down? Douglas is all character. He knows all of the little stinky numbers these guys do. Abraham Lincoln had character. Thank God we got the right president in the Civil War. But that is a question that is a valid one, and you know, I would like to brag about the character of my boss."}

Our nation is in trouble and it is appalling to me that with 10 million Americans out work, with the rest working harder for less money than they did 4 years ago, with the loss of 1.4 million manufacturing jobs in our nation, with the health care crisis, a crisis of crime and drugs and AIDS, substandard education, that George Bush would constantly try to level personal attacks at his opponent. Now, this, of course, just reached a new low last week when he resorted to a classic McCarthyite technique of trying to smear Bill Clinton over a trip that he took as a student along with lots of other Rhodes Scholars who were invited to go to Russia. It\u2019s a classic McCarthyite smear technique. I think the president of the US ought to apologize. I think that he insulted the intelligence of the American people and I\u2019m awful proud that the American people rejected that tactic so overwhelmingly that he decided he had made a mistake. Do you think it was a mistake, too, Dan?"}

But I happen to \u2014 I agree with one thing on \u2014 with Senator Gore, and that is that we ought to look to the future, and the future is, who\u2019s going to be the next president of the US. And is it a negative attack and a personal attack to point out that Bill Clinton simply has trouble telling the truth? He said that he didn\u2019t even demonstrate \u2014 he told the people in Arkansas in 1978. Then we find out he organized demonstrations. You know, I don\u2019t care whether he demonstrated or didn\u2019t demonstrate. The fact \u2014 the question is, tell the truth. Just tell us the truth. Today, Bill Clinton \u2014 excuse me \u2014 yesterday in Philadelphia on a radio show, just yesterday on a radio show, he attacked \u2014 Admiral, he attacks Ross Perot saying the media is giving Ross Perot a free ride. The press asked him when the klieg lights are on, said what do you mean by Ross Perot getting a free ride? He says I didn\u2019t say that at all. I mean, you can\u2019t have it both ways. No, I don\u2019t think that is a personal attack. What I find troubling with Bill Clinton is he can\u2019t tell the truth. You cannot lead this great country of ours by misleading the people."}

He is, as I have read in more than one article, a revolutionary; he\u2019s got plans out there that are going to double the speed at which this budget problem is being cared for. It was asked how, if we would squeeze down so fast that we would strangle the economy in the process. That is an art, to follow all those variables and know when to let up and to nurse this economy back together with pulls and pushes. And there\u2019s no better man in the world to do that than that old artist, Ross Perot. And so I think that my closing statement is that I think I\u2019m in a room with people that aren\u2019t the life of reality. The US is in deep trouble. We\u2019ve got to have somebody that can get up there and bring out the firehoses and get it stopped, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re about in the Perot campaign."}

We can continue traveling the road we have been on, which has led to higher unemployment and worse economic times, or we can reach out for change. If we choose change, it will require us to reach down inside ourselves to find the courage to take a new direction. Sometimes it seems deceptively easy to continue with the old habits even when they\u2019re no longer good for us. Trickle-down economics simply does not work. We have had an increase in all of the things that should be decreasing. Everything that should have been increasing has been going down. We have got to change direction. Bill Clinton offers a new approach. He has been named by the other 49 governors, Republicans and Democrats alike, as the best and most effective governor in the entire US of America. He\u2019s moved 17,000 people off the welfare rolls and on to payrolls. He has introduced innovations in health care and education, and again, he has led the nation for the last 2 years in a row in the creation of jobs in the private sector. Isn\u2019t it time for a new approach, a new generation of ideas and leadership, to put our nation\u2019s people first and to get our economy moving again? We simply cannot stand to continue with this failed approach that is no good for us. Ultimately, it is a choice between hope and fear, a choice between the future and the past. It is time to reach out for a better nation. We are bigger than George Bush has told us we are, as a nation, and we have a much brighter future. Give us a chance.

I\u2019d like to use this closing statement to talk to you about a few people that I have met in these last 4 years. I think of a woman in Chicago when I was talking to parents about education where she stood up and said I\u2019m sick and tired of these schools in this city being nothing but a factory for failure. And that\u2019s why we support choice in education. I was in Beaumont, Texas, and met with small business people, and they wanted to reform the civil justice system because they think our legal system costs too much and there\u2019s too much of a delay in getting an answer. I was in Middletown, Ohio, talking to a welfare woman, where she said I want to go back to work and I had a job offered to me but I\u2019m not going to take it because I have 2 children at home and the job that is offered to me doesn\u2019t have health insurance. Under President Bush\u2019s health care reform package that woman won\u2019t have to make a choice about going back to work or health care for her children, because she\u2019ll have both. I was in Vilnius, Lithuania, Independence Square, speaking to 10,000 people in the middle of winter. Hundreds of people came up to me and said - God bless America. Yes, in the next 4 years, as I said, somewhere, some time, there\u2019s going to be a crisis, and you need to have a president that is qualified, has the experience, and has been tested. Not one time during this evening, during 90 minutes, did Al Gore tell us why Bill Clinton is qualified to be president. He never answered my charges that Bill Clinton has trouble telling the truth. The choice is yours. The American people should demand that their president tell the truth. Do you really believe \u2014 do you really believe Bill Clinton will tell the truth? And do you, do you trust Bill Clinton to be your president?"}

We\u2019ve shipped millions of jobs overseas and we have a strange situation because we have a process in Washington where after you\u2019ve served for a while you cash in, become a foreign lobbyist, make $30,000 a month, then take a leave, work on presidential campaigns, make sure you\u2019ve got good contacts and then go back out. Now, if you just want to get down to brass tacks, first thing you ought to do is get all these folks who\u2019ve got these 1-way trade agreements that we\u2019ve negotiated over the years and say fellas, we\u2019ll take the same deal we gave you. And they\u2019ll gridlock right at that point because for example, we\u2019ve got international competitors who simply could not unload their cars off the ships if they had to comply \u2014 you see, if it was a 2-way street, just couldn\u2019t do it. We have got to stop sending jobs overseas. To those of you in the audience who are business people - pretty simple. If you\u2019re paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for a factory worker, and you can move your factory south of the border, pay $1 an hour for labor, hire a young \u2014 let\u2019s assume you\u2019ve been in business for a long time. You\u2019ve got a mature workforce. Pay $1 an hour for your labor, have no health care \u2014 that\u2019s the most expensive single element in making the car. Have no environmental controls, no pollution controls and no retirement. And you don\u2019t care about anything but making money. There will be a job-sucking sound going south. If the people send me to Washington the first thing I\u2019ll do is study that 2000-page agreement and make sure it\u2019s a 2-way street. One last point here. I decided I was dumb and didn\u2019t understand it so I called a \u201cWho\u2019s Who\u201d of the folks that have been around it, and I said why won\u2019t everybody go south; they said it will be disruptive; I said for how long. I finally got \u2019em for 12 to 15 years. And I said, well, how does it stop being disruptive? And that is when their jobs come up from a dollar an hour to $6 an hour, and ours go down to $6 an hour; then it\u2019s leveled again, but in the meantime you\u2019ve wrecked the country with these kind of deals. We got to cut it out."}

And if indeed all the jobs were going to move south because there are lower wages, there are lower wages now and they haven\u2019t done that. And so I have just negotiated with the president of Mexico the North American Free Trade Agreement \u2014 and the prime minister of Canada, I might add \u2014 and I want to have more of these free trade agreements, because export jobs are increasing far faster than any jobs that may have moved overseas. That\u2019s a scare tactic, because it\u2019s not that many. But any one that\u2019s here, we want to have more jobs here. And the way to do that is to increase our exports. Some believe in protection. I don\u2019t; I believe in free and fair trade, and that\u2019s the thing that saved us. So I will keep on as president trying to get a successful conclusion to the GATT Round, the big Uruguay Round of trade which will really open up markets for our agriculture particularly. I want to continue to work after we get this NAFTA agreement ratified this coming year. I want to get one with Eastern Europe; I want to get one with Chile. And free and fair trade is the answer, not protection. And, as I say, we\u2019ve had tough economic times, and it\u2019s exports that have saved us, exports that have built."}

The trick is to expand our export base and to expand trade on terms that are fair to us. It is true that our exports to Mexico, for example, have gone up and our trade deficit has gone down; it\u2019s also true that just today a record high trade deficit was announced with Japan. So what is the answer? Let me just mention three things very quickly. Number one, make sure that other countries are as open to our markets as our markets are to them, and, if they\u2019re not, have measures on the books that don\u2019t take forever and a day to implement. Number two, change the tax code. There are more deductions in the tax code for shutting plants down and moving overseas than there are for modernizing plant and equipment here. Our competitors don\u2019t do that. Emphasize and subsidize modernizing plant and equipment here, not moving plants overseas. Number three, stop the federal government\u2019s program that now gives low-interest loans and job training funds to companies that will actually shut down and move to other countries, but we won\u2019t do the same thing for plants that stay here. So more trade but on fair terms \u2014 and favor investment in America."}

And I\u2019ll tell you exactly why. Because the deficit now has been building up for 12 years. I\u2019ll tell you exactly what I think can be done. I think we can bring it down by 50% in 4 years and grow the economy. Now, I could get rid of it in 4 years in theory on the books now, but to do it you\u2019d have to raise taxes too much and cut benefits too much to people who need them and it would even make the economy worse. Mr. Perot will tell you, for example, that the expert he hired to analyze his plan says that it will bring the deficit down in 5 years but it will make unemployment bad for 4 more years. So my view is, sir, you have to increase investment, grow the economy and reduce the deficit by controlling health care costs, prudent reductions in defense, cuts in domestic programs and asking the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their fair share of taxes and investing and growing this economy. I ask everybody to look at my economic ideas and 9 Nobel prize winners and over 500 economists and hundreds of business people, including a lot of Republicans said, this is the way you\u2019ve got to go. If you don\u2019t grow the economy you can\u2019t get it done. But I can\u2019t foresee all the things that will happen, and I don\u2019t think a president should be judged solely on the deficit. Let me also say, we\u2019re having an election today. You\u2019ll have a shot at me in 4 years and you can vote me right out if you think I\u2019ve done a lousy job and I would welcome you to do that."}

You see, I don\u2019t think the American people are taxed too little. I think they\u2019re taxed too much. I went for one tax increase and when I make a mistake I admit it. I said that wasn\u2019t the right thing to do. Governor Clinton\u2019s program wants to tax more and spend more \u2014 $150 billion in new taxes, spend another $220. I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the way to do it. Here\u2019s some thing that\u2019ll help. Give us a balanced budget amendment. He always talks about Arkansas having a balanced budget and they do, but he has a balanced budget amendment. Have to do it. I\u2019d like the government to have that. And I think it would discipline not only the Congress, which needs it, but also the executive branch. I\u2019d like to have what 43 governors have \u2014 the line item veto, so if the Congress can\u2019t cut, and we\u2019ve got a reckless spending Congress, let the president have a shot at it by wiping out things that are pork barrel or something of that nature. I\u2019ve proposed another one. Some sophisticates think it may be a little gimmicky. I think it\u2019s good. It\u2019s a check- off. It says to you as a taxpayer \u2014 say you\u2019re going to pay a tax of 1000 bucks or something. You can check 10% of that if you want to, in the 1 box, and that 10%, $100, or if you\u2019re paying $10,000, whatever it is, $1000, check it off and make the government, make it lower the deficit by that amount. And if the Congress won\u2019t do it, if they can\u2019t get together and negotiate how to do that, then you\u2019d have a sequester across the board. You\u2019d exempt Social Security \u2014 I don\u2019t want to tax or touch Social Security. I\u2019m the president that said hey, don\u2019t mess with Social Security, and we haven\u2019t. So I believe that we need to control the growth of mandatory spending, back to this gentleman\u2019s question. That\u2019s the main growing thing in the budget. The program that the president \u2014 two-thirds of the budget, I as president never get to look at, never get to touch. We\u2019ve got to control that growth to inflation and population increase, but not raise taxes on the American people now. I just don\u2019t believe that would stimulate any kind of growth at all."}

We\u2019re going into debt an additional $1 billion, little more than $1 billion every working day of the year. Now, the thing I love about it \u2014 I\u2019m just a businessman. I was down in Texas taking care of business, tending to my family. This situation got so bad that I decided I\u2019d better get into it. The American people asked me to get into it. But I just find it fascinating that while we sit here tonight we will go into debt an additional $50 million in an hour and a half. Now, it\u2019s not the Republicans\u2019 fault, of course, and it\u2019s not the Democrats\u2019 fault. And what I\u2019m looking for is who did it? Now, they\u2019re the 2 folks involved so maybe if you put them together, they did it. Now, the facts are we have to fix it. I\u2019m here tonight for these young people up here in the balcony from this college. When I was a young man, when I got out of the Navy I had multiple job offers. Young people with high grades can\u2019t get a job. People \u2014 the 18- to 24-year-old high school graduates 10 years ago were making more than they are now. In other words, we were down to 18% of them were making \u2014 18- to 24-year- olds were making less than $12,000. Now that\u2019s up to 40%. And what\u2019s happened in the meantime? The dollar\u2019s gone through the floor. Now, whose fault is that? Not the Democrats. Not the Republicans. Somewhere out there there\u2019s an extraterrestrial that\u2019s doing this to us, I guess. And everybody says they take responsibility. Somebody somewhere has to take responsibility for this. Put it to you bluntly, American people. If you want me to be your president, we\u2019re going to face our problems. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll deal with our problems, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll solve our problems. We\u2019ll down our debt. We\u2019ll pass on the American dream to our children, and I will not leave our children a situation that they have today. When I was a boy it took 2 generations to double the standard of living. Today it will take 12 generations. Our children will not see the American dream because of this debt that somebody somewhere dropped on us."}

I think you have to look at it. I think that has to be a part of a candidate for president or being president. In terms of programs, I\u2019ve submitted, what, 4 different budgets to the US Congress in great detail. It\u2019s so heavy they\u2019d give you a broken back. And everything in there says what I am for. Now I\u2019ve come out with a new agenda for America\u2019s renewal, a plan that I believe really will help stimulate the growth of this economy. My record on world affairs is pretty well known because I\u2019ve been president for 4 years, so I feel I\u2019ve been talking issues. You know, nobody likes who shot John, but I think the first negative campaign run in this election was by Governor Clinton, and I\u2019m not going to sit there and be a punching bag; I\u2019m going to stand up and say, hey, listen, here\u2019s my side of it. But character is an important part of the equation. The other night Governor Clinton raised my \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you saw the debate the other night. You did \u2014 suffered through that? Well, he raised the question of my father \u2014 it was a good line, well rehearsed and well delivered. But he raised the question of my father and said, well, your father, Prescott Bush, was against McCarthy, you should be ashamed of yourself, McCarthyism. I remember something my dad told me \u2014 I was 18 years old going to Penn Station to go on into the Navy, and he said write your mother \u2014 which I faithfully did; he said serve your country \u2014 my father was an honor, duty and country man; and he said tell the truth. And I\u2019ve tried to do that in public life, all through it. That says something about character. My argument with Governor Clinton \u2014 you can call it mud wrestling, but I think it\u2019s fair to put it in focus is \u2014 I am deeply troubled by someone who demonstrates and organizes demonstration in a foreign land when his country\u2019s at war. Probably a lot of kids here disagree with me. But that\u2019s what I feel. That\u2019s what I feel passionately about. I\u2019m thinking of Ross Perot\u2019s running mate sitting in the jail.

I also had a program starting last year. I\u2019ve been disturbed by the tone and the tenor of this campaign. Thank goodness the networks have a fact check so I don\u2019t have to just go blue in the face anymore. Mr. Bush said once again I was going to have $150 billion tax increase. When Mr. Quayle said that all the networks said, that\u2019s not true. He\u2019s got over $100 billion of tax cuts and incentives. So I\u2019m not going to take up your time tonight, but let me just say this. We\u2019ll have a debate in 4 days and we can talk about this character thing again. But the Washington Post ran a long editorial today saying they couldn\u2019t believe Mr. Bush was making character an issue and they said he was the greatest quote \u201cpolitical chameleon\u201d for changing his positions of all times.

We passed this year the most furthest looking transportation bill in the history of this country since Eisenhower started the interstate highways \u2014 $150 billion for improving the infrastructure. That happened when I was president. And so I\u2019m very proud of the way that came about and I think it\u2019s a very, very good beginning. Like Mr. Perot, I am concerned about the deficits and $150 billion is a lot of money, but it\u2019s awful hard to say we\u2019re going to go out and spend more money when we\u2019re trying to get the deficit down. But I would cite that as a major accomplishment. We hear all the negatives. When you\u2019re president you expect this. Everybody\u2019s running against the incumbent. They can do better. Everyone knows that. But here\u2019s something that we can take great pride in because it really does get to what you\u2019re talking about. Our home initiative \u2014 our home ownership initiative \u2014 HOPE \u2014 that passed the Congress is a good start for having people own their own homes instead of living in these deadly tenements. Our enterprise zones, that we hear a lot of lip service about in Congress, would bring jobs into the inner city. There\u2019s a good program. And I need the help of everybody across this country to get it passed in a substantial way by the Congress. When we went out to south central in Los Angeles \u2014 some of you may remember the riots there. I went out there. I went to a boys\u2019 club. And everyone of them \u2014 the boys\u2019 club leaders, the ministers \u2014 all of them were saying pass enterprise zones. We go back to Washington and very difficult to get it through the Congress. But there\u2019s going to be a new Congress. No one likes gridlock. There\u2019s going to be a new Congress because the old one \u2014 I don\u2019t want to get this man made at me \u2014 but there was a post office scandal and a bank scandal. You\u2019re going to have a lot of new members of Congress. And then you can sit down and say, help me do what we should for the cities. Help me pass these programs."}

This is facts \u2014 that would have given investment tax credits and other incentives to reinvest in our cities, in our country. But it asked the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more. Mr. Perot wants to do the same thing. I agree with him. I mean, we agree with that. But let me tell you specifically what my plan does. My plan would dedicate $20 billion a year in each of the next 4 years for investments in new transportation, communications, environmental clean-ups and new technologies for the 21st century. And we would target it especially in areas that have been either depressed or which have lost a lot of defense related jobs. There are 200,000 people in California, for example, who have lost their defense related jobs. They ought to be engaged in making high speed rail. They ought to be engaged in breaking ground in other technologies, doing waste recycling, clean water technology and things of that kind. We can create millions of jobs in these new technologies- -more than we\u2019re going to lose in defense \u2014 if we target it. But we\u2019re investing a much smaller percentage of our income in the things you just asked about than all of our major competitors, and our wealth growth is going down as a result of it. It\u2019s making the country poorer, which is why I answered the gentleman the way I did before. We have to both bring down the deficit and get our economy going through these kinds of investments in order to get the kind of wealth and jobs and incomes we need in America."}

I live in a state where over half the adults have hunting or fishing licenses, or both. But I believe we have to have some way of checking hand guns before they\u2019re sold, to check the criminal history, the mental health history, and the age of people who are buying them. Therefore I support the Brady bill which would impose a national waiting period unless and until a state did what only Virginia has done now, which is to automate its records. Once you automate your records, then you don\u2019t have to have a waiting period, but at least you can check. I also think we should have frankly restrictions on assault weapons whose only purpose is to kill. We need to give the police a fighting chance in our urban areas where the gangs are building up. The third thing I would say \u2014 it doesn\u2019t bear directly on gun control, but it\u2019s very important \u2014 we need more police on the street. There is a crime bill which would put more police on the street, which was killed for this session by a filibuster in the Senate, mostly be Republican senators, and I think it\u2019s a shame it didn\u2019t pass, I think it should be made the law \u2014 but it had the Brady bill in it, the waiting period. I also believe that we should offer college scholarships to people who will agree to work them off as police officers, and I think, as we reduce our military forces, we should let people earn military retirement by coming out and working as police officers. Thirty years ago there were three police officers on the street for every crime; today there are three crimes for every police officer. In the communities which have had real success putting police officers near schools where kids carry weapons, to get the weapons out of the schools, are on the same blocks, you\u2019ve seen crime go down. In Houston there\u2019s been a 15- percent drop in the crime rate in the last year because of the work the mayor did there in increasing the police force. So I know it can work; I\u2019ve seen it happen."}

It\u2019s very hard. I have been fighting for very strong anti-crime legislation \u2014 habeas corpus reform, so you don\u2019t have these endless appeals, so when somebody gets sentenced, hey, this is for real. I\u2019ve been fighting for changes in the exclusionary rule so if an honest cop stops somebody and makes a technical mistake, the criminal doesn\u2019t go away. I\u2019ll probably get into a fight in this room with some but I happen to think that we need stronger death penalties for those that kill police officers. Virginia\u2019s in the lead in this, as Governor Clinton properly said, on this identification system for firearms. I am not for national registration of firearms. Some of the states that have the toughest anti-gun laws have the highest levels of crime. I am for the right, as the governor says- -I\u2019m a sportsman and I don\u2019t think you ought to eliminate all kinds of weapons. But I was not for the bill that he was talking about because it was not tough enough on the criminal. I\u2019m very pleased that the Fraternal Order of Police in Little Rock, Arkansas endorsed me because I think they see I\u2019m trying to strengthen the anti-crime legislation. We\u2019ve got more money going out for local police than any previous administration. So we\u2019ve got to get it under control and there\u2019s one last point I\u2019d make. Drugs. We have got to win our national strategy against drugs, the fight against drugs. And we\u2019re making some progress, doing a little better on interdiction. We\u2019re not doing as well amongst the people that get to be habitual drug-users. The good news is, and I think it\u2019s true in Richmond, teenage use is down of cocaine, substantially, 60% in the last couple of years. So we\u2019re making progress but until we get that one done, we\u2019re not going to solve the neighborhood crime problem."}

So why pass a law that won\u2019t fix it? Now, what it really boils down to is can you live \u2014 we become so preoccupied with the rights of the criminal that we\u2019ve forgotten the rights of the innocent. And in our country we have evolved to a point where we\u2019ve put millions of innocent people in jail because you go to the poor neighborhoods and they\u2019ve put bars on their windows and bars on their doors and put themselves in jail to protect the things that they acquired legitimately. That\u2019s where we are. We have got to become more concerned about people who play by the rules and get the balance we require. This is going to take first, building a consensus at grassroots America. Right from the bottom up, the American people have got to say they want it. And at that point, we can pick from a variety of plans and develop new plans. And the way you get things done is bury yourselves in the room with one another, put together the best program, take it to the American people, use the electronic town hall, the kind of thing you\u2019re doing here tonight, build a consensus and then do it and then go on to the next one.

So let me try to answer you in this way. Let\u2019s start with a premise. We spend 30% more of our income than any nation on earth on health care, and yet we insure fewer people. We have 35 million people without any insurance at all \u2014 and I see them all the time. A hundred thousand Americans a month have lost their health insurance just in the last 4 years. So if you analyze where we\u2019re out of line with other countries, you come up with the following conclusions. Number one, we spend at least $60 billion a year on insurance, administrative cost, bureaucracy, and government regulation that wouldn\u2019t be spent in any other nation. So we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everybody. Employers would cover their employees, government would cover the unemployed. Number 2, I think you have to take on specifically the insurance companies and require them to make some significant change in the way they rate people in the big community pools. I think you have to tell the pharmaceutical companies they can\u2019t keep raising drug prices at three times the rate of inflation. I think you have to take on medical fraud. I think you have to help doctors stop practicing defensive medicine. I\u2019ve recommended that our doctors be given a set of national practice guidelines and that if they follow those guidelines that raises the presumption that they didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I think you have to have a system of primary and preventive clinics in our inner cities and our rural areas so people can have access to health care. The key is to control the cost and maintain the quality. To do that you need a system of managed competition where all of us are covered in big groups and we can choose our doctors and our hospitals, a wide range, but there is an incentive to control costs. And I think there has to be \u2014 I think Mr. Perot and I agree on this, there has to be a national commission of health care providers and health care consumers that set ceilings to keep health costs in line with inflation, plus population growth. Now, let me say, some people say we can\u2019t do this but Hawaii does it. They cover 98% of their people and their insurance premiums are much cheaper than the rest of America, and so does Rochester, New York. They now have a plan to cover everybody and their premiums are two-thirds of the rest of the country. This is very important. It\u2019s a big human problem and a devastating economic problem for America, and I\u2019m going to send a plan to do this within the first 100 days of my presidency. It\u2019s terribly important."}

I don\u2019t want to stampede. Ross was very articulate across the country. I don\u2019t want anybody to stampede to cut the president\u2019s salary off altogether. Barbara\u2019s sitting over here and I \u2014 but what I have proposed, 10% cut, downsize the government, and we can get that done. She asked a question, I think, is whether the health care profession was to blame. No. One thing to blame is these malpractice lawsuits. They\u2019re breaking the system. It costs $20-25 billion a year, and I want to see those outrageous claims capped. Doctors don\u2019t dare to deliver babies sometimes because they\u2019re afraid that somebody\u2019s going to sue them. People don\u2019t dare \u2014 medical practitioners, to help somebody along the highway that are hurt because they\u2019re afraid that some lawyer\u2019s going to come along and get a big lawsuit. So you can\u2019t blame the practitioners for the health problem. And my program is this. Keep the government as far out of it as possible, make insurance available to the poorest of the poor, through vouchers, next range in the income bracket, through tax credits, and get on about the business of pooling insurance. A great big company can buy \u2014 Ross has got a good-sized company, been very successful. He can buy insurance cheaper than Mom and Pop\u2019s store on the corner. But if those Mom and Pop stores all get together and pool, they too can bring the cost of insurance down. So I want to keep the quality of health care. That means keep government out of it. I want to do \u2014 I don\u2019t like this idea of these boards. It all sounds to me like you\u2019re going to have some government setting price. I want competition and I want to pool the insurance and take care of it that way and have \u2014 oh, here\u2019s the other point. I think medical care should go with the person. If you leave a business, I think your insurance should go with you to some other business. You shouldn\u2019t be worrying if you get a new job as to whether that\u2019s gonna \u2014 and part of our plan is to make it what they call portable \u2014 big word, but that means if you\u2019re working for the Jones Company and you go to the Smith Company, your insurance goes with you. I think it\u2019s a good program. I\u2019m really excited about getting it done, too."}

Twelve percent of our gross national product goes to health care. Our industrial competitors, who are beating us in competition, spend less and have better health care. Japan spends a little over 6% of its gross national product. Germany spends 8%. It\u2019s fascinating. You\u2019ve bought a front row box seat and you\u2019re not happy with your health care and you\u2019re saying tonight we\u2019ve got bad health care but very expensive health care. Folks, here\u2019s why. Go home and look in the mirror. You own this country but you have no voice in it the way it\u2019s organized now, and if you want to have a high risk experience, comparable to bungee jumping, go into Congress some time when they\u2019re working on this kind of legislation, when the lobbyists are running up and down the halls. Wear your safety toe shoes when you go. And as a private citizen, believe me, you are looked on as a major nuisance. The facts are you now have a government that comes at you. You\u2019re supposed to have a government that comes from you. Now, there are all kinds of good ideas, brilliant ideas, terrific ideas on health care. None of them ever get implemented because \u2014 let me give you an example. A senator runs every 6 years. He\u2019s got to raise 20,000 bucks a week to have enough money to run. Who\u2019s he gonna listen to \u2014 us or the folks running up and down the aisles with money, the lobbyists, the PAC money? He listens to them. Who do they represent? Health care industry. Not us. Now, you\u2019ve got to have a government that comes from you again. You\u2019ve got to reassert your ownership in this country and you\u2019ve got to completely reform our government. And at that point they\u2019ll just be like apples falling out of a tree. The programs will be good because the elected officials will be listening to \u2014 I said the other night I was all ears and I would listen to any good idea. I think we ought to do plastic surgery on a lot of these guys so that they\u2019re all ears, too, and listen to you. Then you get what you want, and shouldn\u2019t you? You paid for it. Why shouldn\u2019t you get what you want, as opposed to what some lobbyist cuts a deal, writes a little piece in the law and he goes through. That\u2019s the way the game\u2019s played now. Till you change it you\u2019re gonna be unhappy. SIMPSON (continuing): You wanted one brief point in there."}

The point I want to make to you is, a bipartisan commission reviewed my plan and the Bush plan and there were as many Republicans as Democratic health care experts on it. They concluded that my plan would cover everybody and his would leave 27 million behind by the year 2000 and that my plan in the next 12 years would save $2.2 trillion in public and private money to reinvest in this economy and the average family would save $1200 a year under the plan that I offered without any erosion in the quality of health care So I ask you to look at that. And you have to vote for somebody with a plan. That\u2019s what you have elections for. If people would say, well, he got elected to do this and then the Congress says, okay, I\u2019m going to do it.

I\u2019ll tell you how it\u2019s affected me. Every year Congress and the president sign laws that make us do more things and gives us less money to do it with. I see people in my state, middle class people \u2014 their taxes have gone up in Washington and their services have gone down while the wealthy have gotten tax cuts. I have seen what\u2019s happened in this last 4 years when \u2014 in my state, when people lose their jobs there\u2019s a good chance I\u2019ll know them by their names. When a factory closes, I know the people who ran it. When the businesses go bankrupt, I know them. And I\u2019ve been out here for 13 months meeting in meetings just like this ever since October, with people like you all over America, people that have lost their jobs, lost their livelihood, lost their health insurance. What I want you to understand is the national debt is not the only cause of that. It is because America has not invested in its people. It is because we have not grown. It is because we\u2019ve had 12 years of trickle down economics. We\u2019ve gone from first to twelfth in the world in wages. We\u2019ve had 4 years where we\u2019ve produced no private sector jobs. Most people are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago. It is because we are in the grip of a failed economic theory. And this decision you\u2019re about to make better be about what kind of economic theory you want, not just people saying I\u2019m going to go fix it but what are we going to do? I think we have to do is invest in American jobs, American education, control American health care costs and bring the American people together again."}

The Social Security system was fixed about 5 years, and I think it\u2019s projected out to be sound beyond that. So at least we have time to work with it. But on all of these things, a sound economy is the only way to get it going. Growth in the economy is gonna add to the overall prosperity and wealth. I can\u2019t give you a specific answer on Pension Guarantee Fund. All I know is that we have firm government credit to guarantee the pensions. And that is very important. But it\u2019s \u2014 the full faith and credit of the US, in spite of our difficulties, is still pretty good. It\u2019s still the most respected credit. So I would simply say, as these dates get close, you\u2019re going to have to reorganize and refix as we did with the Social Security Fund. And I think that\u2019s the only answer. But the more immediate answer is to do what this lady was suggesting we do, and that is to get this deficit down and get on without adding to the woes, and then restructure. One thing I\u2019ve called for that has been stymied, and I\u2019ll keep on working for it, is a whole financial reform legislation. It is absolutely essential in terms of bringing our banking system and credit system into the new age instead of having it living back in the dark ages. And it\u2019s a big fight. And I don\u2019t want to give my friend Ross another shot at me here but I am fighting with the Congress to get this through. And you can\u2019t just go up and say I\u2019m going to fix it. You\u2019ve got some pretty strong-willed guys up there that argue with you. But that\u2019s what the election\u2019s about. I agree with the governor. That\u2019s what the election\u2019s about. And sound fiscal policy is the best answer, I think, to all the three problems you mentioned."}

You have a raging debate about those plans. Then out of that debate, with leadership, comes consensus. Then, if the plans are huge and complex like health care, I would urge you to implement pilot programs. Like the old carpenter says measure twice, cut once. Let\u2019s make sure this thing\u2019s as good as we all think it is at the end of the meeting. Then finally, our government passes laws and freezes the plan in concrete. Anybody that\u2019s ever built a successful business will tell you you optimize, optimize, optimize after you\u2019ve put something into effect. The reason Medicare and Medicaid are a mess is we froze them. Everybody knows how to fix them. There are people all over the federal government, if they could just touch it with a screwdriver, could fix it. Now, back over here. See, we\u2019ve got a $4 trillion debt and only in America would you have $2.8 trillion of it or 70% of it financed 5 years or less. Now, that\u2019s another thing for you to think about when you go home tonight. You don\u2019t finance long-term debt with short-term money. Why did our government do it? To get the interest rates down. A 1% increase in interest rates in that $2.8 trillion is $28 billion a year. Now, when you look at what Germany pays for money and what we don\u2019t pay for money, you realize there\u2019s quite a spread, right, and you realize this is a temporary thing and there\u2019s going to be another sucking sound that runs our deficit through the roof. You know, and everybody\u2019s ducking it so I\u2019m gonna say it, that we are not letting that surplus stay in the bank. We are not investing that surplus like a pension fund. We are spending that surplus to make the deficit look smaller to you than it really is. Now, that \u2014 put you in jail in corporate America if you kept books that way but in government it\u2019s just kind of the way things are. That\u2019s because it comes at you, not from you. Now then, that money needs to be \u2014 they don\u2019t even pay interest on it. They just write a note for the interest."}

We\u2019ve got to double-hit. If we\u2019re $4 trillion down, we should have everything perfect, but we don\u2019t. We\u2019ve got to pay it off and build money to renew it- -spend money to renew it, and that\u2019s going to take a growing, expanding job base. That is priority one in this country.

(Laughter.) Let me say first of all, I want to answer your specific question but first of all, we all agree that there should be a growing economy. What you have to decide is who\u2019s got the best economic plan. And we all have ideas out there, and Mr. Bush has a record. So I don\u2019t want you to read my lips and I sure don\u2019t want you to read his. I do hope you will read our plans. Now, specifically, one, on Medicare, it is not true that everyone knows how to fix it. There are different ideas \u2014 the Bush plan, the Perot plan, the Clinton \u2014 we have different ideas. I am convinced, having studied health care for a year hard and talking to hundreds and hundreds of people all across America, that you cannot control the cost of Medicare until you control the cost of private health care and public health care, with managed competition, ceiling on cost, and radical reorganization of the insurance markets. You\u2019ve got to do that; we got to get those costs down. Number 2, with regard to Social Security, that program \u2014 a lot of you may not know this \u2014 it produces a $70 billion surplus a year. Social Security is in surplus $70 billion. Six increases in the payroll tax \u2014 that means people with incomes of $51,000 a year or less pay a disproportionally high share of the federal tax burden, which is why I want some middle-class tax relief. What do we have to do? By the time the century turns, we have got to have our deficit under control, we have to work out of so that surplus is building up so when the baby boomers like me retire, we\u2019re okay. Number 3, on the pension funds, I don\u2019t know as much about it, but I will say this. What I would do is to bring in the pension experts of the country, take a look at it, and strengthen the pension requirements further, because it\u2019s not just enough to have the guarantee. We had a guarantee on the S&Ls, right? We had a guarantee \u2014 and what happened? You picked up a $500-billion bill because of the dumb way the federal government deregulated it. So I think we are going to have to change and strengthen the pension requirements on private retirement plans."}

Since I became president, 43, 44 countries have gone democratic, no longer totalitarian, no longer living under dictatorship or communist rule. This is exciting. New world order to me means freedom and democracy. I think we will have a continuing responsibility, as the only remaining superpower, to stay involved. If we pull back in some isolation and say we don\u2019t have to do our share, or more than our share, anymore, I believe you are going to just ask for conflagration that we\u2019ll get involved in the future. NATO, for example, has kept the peace for many, many years, and I want to see us keep fully staffed in NATO so we\u2019ll continue to guarantee the peace in Europe. But the exciting thing is, the fear of nuclear war is down. And you hear all the bad stuff that\u2019s happened on my watch; I hope people will recognize that this is something pretty good for mankind. I hope they\u2019ll think it\u2019s good that democracy and freedom is on the move. And we\u2019re going to stay engaged, as long as I\u2019m president, working to improve things. You know, it\u2019s so easy now to say, hey, cut out foreign aid, we got a problem at home. I think the US has to still have the Statue of Liberty as a symbol, caring for others. Right this very minute we\u2019re sending supplies in to help these little starving kids in Somalia. It\u2019s the US that\u2019s taken the lead in humanitarian aid into Bosnia. We\u2019re doing this all around the world. Yes, we got problems at home. And I think I got a good plan to help fix those problems at home. But because of our leadership, because we didn\u2019t listen to the freeze \u2014 the nuclear-freeze group, do you remember \u2014 freeze it, back in the late 70s \u2014 freeze, don\u2019t touch it; we\u2019re going to lock it in now or else we\u2019ll have war. President Reagan said no, peace through strength. It worked. The Soviet Union is no more, and now we\u2019re working to help them become totally democratic through the Freedom Support Act that I led on, a great Democratic ambassador, Bob Strauss, over there, Jim Baker, all of us got this thing passed \u2014 through cooperation, Ross \u2014 it worked with cooperation, and you\u2019re for that, I\u2019m sure, helping Russia become democratic. So the new world order to me means freedom and democracy, keep engaged, do not pull back into isolation. And we are the US, and we have a responsibility to lead and to guarantee the security. If it hadn\u2019t been for us, Saddam Hussein would be sitting on top of three-fifths of the oil supply of the world and he\u2019d have nuclear weapons. And only the US could do this. Excuse me, Carole."}

Russia is still very unstable; they could go back to square one, and worse. All the nuclear weapons are not dismantled. I am particularly concerned about the intercontinental weapons, the ones that can hit us. We\u2019ve got agreements, but they are still there. With all this instability and breaking into republics, and all the Middle Eastern countries going over there and shopping for weapons, we\u2019ve got our work cut out for us. So we need to stay right on top of that and constructively help them move toward democracy and capitalism. We have to have money to do that. We have to have our people at work. See, for 45 years we were preoccupied with the Red Army. I suggest now that our number one preoccupation is red ink and our country and we\u2019ve got to put our people back to work so that we can afford to do these things we want to do in Russia. We cannot be the policeman for the world any longer. We spent $300 billion a year defending the world. Germany and Japan spend around $30 billion a piece. If I can get you to defend me and I can spend all my money building industry that\u2019s a home run for me. Coming out of World War II it made sense. Now, the other superpowers need to do their part. I\u2019ll close on this point. You can\u2019t be a superpower unless you\u2019re an economic superpower. If we\u2019re not an economic superpower, we\u2019re a used to be and we will no longer be a force for good throughout the world. And if nothing else gets you excited about rebuilding our industrial base maybe that will because job one is to put our people back to work."}

Because the question you ask is important. The end of the Cold War brings an incredible opportunity for change. Winds of freedom blowing around the world, Russia demilitarizing. And it also requires us to maintain some continuity \u2014 some bipartisan American commitment to certain principles. And I would just say there are three things that I would like to say \u2014 number one \u2014 we do have to maintain the world\u2019s strongest defense. We may differ about what the elements of that are. I think that defense needs to be \u2014 with fewer people in permanent armed services but with greater mobility on the land, in the air and on the sea, with a real dedication to continuing development of high technology weaponry and well trained people. I think we\u2019re going to have to work to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Got to keep going until all those nuclear weapons in Russia are gone and the other republics. Number 2, if you don\u2019t rebuild the economic strength of this country at home, we won\u2019t be a superpower. We can\u2019t have any more instances like what happened when Mr. Bush went to Japan and the Japanese prime minister said he felt sympathy for our country. We have to be the strongest economic power in the world. That\u2019s what got me into this race, so we could rebuild the American economy. And number three, we need to be a force for freedom and democracy and we need to use our unique position to support freedom, whether it\u2019s in Haiti or in China or in any other place, wherever the seeds of freedom are sprouting. We can\u2019t impose it, but we need to nourish it and that\u2019s the kind of thing that I would do as president \u2014 follow those three commitments into the future."}

You can\u2019t do it with the school bureaucracy controlling everything and that\u2019s why we have a new program that I hope people have heard about. It\u2019s being worked now in 1700 communities \u2014 bypassed Congress on this one, Ross \u2014 1700 communities across the country. It\u2019s called America 2000. And it literally says to the communities, re-invent the schools, not just the bricks and mortar but the curriculum and everything else. Think anew. We have a concept called the New American School Corporation where we\u2019re doing exactly that. And so I believe that we\u2019ve got to get the power in the hands of the teachers, not the teachers\u2019 union. What\u2019s happening up there? (Laughter) And so our America 2000 program also says this. It says let\u2019s give parents the choice of a public, private or public school \u2014 public, private or religious school. And it works- -it works in Milwaukee. Democratic woman up there \u2014 taking the lead in this. The mayor up there, on the program. And the schools that are not chosen are improved \u2014 competition does that. So we\u2019ve got to innovate through school choice. We\u2019ve got to innovate through this America 2000 program. But she is absolutely right. The programs that we\u2019ve been trying where you control everything and mandate it from Washington don\u2019t work. The governors \u2014 and I believe Governor Clinton was in on this \u2014 but maybe \u2014 I don\u2019t want to invoke him here. But they come to me and they say, please get the Congress to stop passing so many mandates telling us how to control things. We know better how to do it in California or Texas or wherever it is. So this is what our program is all about. And I believe you\u2019re right on to something, that if we don\u2019t change the education we\u2019re not going to be able to compete. Federal funding for education is up substantially \u2014 Pell grants are up. But it isn\u2019t going to get the job done if we don\u2019t change K through 12."}

Seventy percent of my state\u2019s money goes to the public schools, and I was really honored when Time magazine said that our schools have shown more improvement than any other state in the country except one other \u2014 they named 2 states showing real strides forward in the 80s. So I care a lot about this, and I\u2019ve spent countless hours in schools. But let me start with what you said. I agree with some of what Mr. Bush said, but it\u2019s nowhere near enough. We live in a world where what you earn depends on what you can learn, where the average 18- year-old will change jobs 8 times in a lifetime and where none of us can promise any of you that what you now do for a living is absolutely safe from now on. Nobody running can promise that, there\u2019s too much change in the world. So what should we do? Let me reel some things off real quick, because you said you wanted specifics. Number one, under my program we would provide matching funds to states to teach everybody with a job to read in the next 5 years and give everybody with a job the chance to get a high school diploma, in big places on the job. Number 2, we would provide 2-year apprenticeship programs to high school graduates who don\u2019t go to college. And community colleges are on the job. Number three, we\u2019d open the doors to college education to high school graduates without regard to income. They could borrow the money and pay it back as a percentage of their income or with a couple of years of service to our nation here at home. Number 4, we would fully fund the Head Start program to get little kids off to a good start. And, 5, I would have an aggressive program of school reform, more choices \u2014 I favor public schools or these new charter schools \u2014 we can talk about that if you want. I don\u2019t think we should spend tax money on private schools. But I favor public school choice, and I favor radical decentralization in giving more power to better-trained principals and teachers with parent councils to control their schools. Those things would revolutionize American education and take us to the top economically."}

So the net cost would be 8 billion 6 years from now in a trillion-plus budget \u2014 not very much. The other stuff \u2014 all the other stuff I mentioned \u2014 costs much less than that. The Head Start program full funding would cost about 5 billion more. And it\u2019s all covered in my budget from \u2014 the plans that I\u2019ve laid out \u2014 from raising taxes on families with incomes above $200,000 and asking foreign corporations to pay the same tax that American corporations do on the same income, from $140 billion in budget cuts, including what I think are very prudent cuts in the defense budget. It\u2019s all covered in the plan."}
{"Title":"October 15, 1992 Second Half Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Second Clinton-Bush-Perot Presidential Debate(Second Half of Debate)","Date":719107200000,"Participants":"Clinton-Bush-Perot","Moderators":"SIMPSON","Speaker":"PEROT","Text":"Yes, I\u2019ve got scars to show for being around education reform. And the first word you need to say in every city and state, and just draw a line in the sand, is public schools exist for the benefit of the children. You\u2019re going to see a lot of people fall over it, because any time you\u2019re spending $199 billion dollars a year, somebody\u2019s getting it. And the children get lost in the process. So that\u2019s step one. Keep in mind in 1960, when our schools were the envy of the world, we were spending $16 billion on them; now we spend more than any other nation in the world \u2014 199 billion a year \u2014 and rank at the bottom of the industrialized world in terms of education achievement. One more time you\u2019ve bought a front-row box seat and got a third-rate performance. This is a government that is not serving you. By and large it should be local \u2014 the more local, the better. Interesting phenomenon: small towns have good schools, big cities have terrible schools. The best people in a small town will serve on the school board; you get into big cities, it\u2019s political patronage, stepping stones \u2014 you get the job, give your relatives a janitor\u2019s job at $57,000 a year, more than the teachers make, and with luck they clean the cafeteria once a week. Now, you\u2019re paying for that. Those schools belong to you. And we put up with that. Now, as long as we put up with that, that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to get. And these folks are just dividing up 199 billion bucks and the children get lost. If I could wish for one thing for great public schools, it would be a strong family unit in every home \u2014 nothing will ever replace that. You say, well, gee, what are you going to do about that? Well, the White House is a bully pulpit, and I think we ought to be pounding on the table every day. There\u2019s nothing \u2014 the most efficient unit of government the world will ever know is a strong loving family unit. Next thing. You need small schools, not big schools. In a little school everybody is somebody; individualism is very important. These big factories? Everybody told me they were cost-effective. I did a study on it; they\u2019re cost- ineffective. 5000 students \u2014 why is a high school that big? One reason. Sooner or later you get 11 more boys that can run like the devil that weigh 250 pounds and they might win district. Now, that has nothing to do with learning. Secondly, across Texas, typically half of the school day was non-academic pursuits \u2014 in one place it was 35%. In Texas you could have unlimited absences to go to livestock shows. Found a boy \u2014 excuse me, but this gives the flavor \u2014 a boy in Houston kept a chicken in the bathtub in downtown Houston and missed 65 days going to livestock shows. Finally had to come back to school, the chicken lost its feathers. That\u2019s the only way we got him back. (Laughter) Now, that\u2019s your tax money being wasted. Now, neighborhood schools. It is terrible to bus tiny little children across town. And it is particularly terrible to take poor tiny little children and wait until the first grade and bus them across town to Mars, where the children know their numbers, know their letters, have had every advantage. At the end of the first day, that little child wants out. I\u2019ll close on this. You\u2019ve got to have world class teachers, world class books. If you ever got close to how textbooks were selected, you wouldn\u2019t want to go back the second day. I don\u2019t have time to tell you the stories."}

My school choice program, GI Bill for Kids, does not take public money and give it to private schools. It does what the GI Bill itself did when I came out of World War II. It takes public money and gives it to families or individuals to choose the school they want. And where it\u2019s been done, those schools, like in Rochester, those schools that weren\u2019t chosen find that they then compete and do better. So I think it\u2019s worth a shot. We\u2019ve got a pilot program. It ought to be tried. School choice \u2014 public, private or religious. Not to the schools but to \u2014 you know, 46% of the teachers in Chicago, public school teachers, send their kids to private school. Now, I think we ought to try to help families and see if it will do what I think \u2014 make all schools better."}

Just a fact clarification real quickly. We do not spend a higher percentage of our income on public education than every other country. There are 9 countries that spend more than we do on public education. We spend more on education \u2019cause we spend so much more on colleges. But if you look at public education alone and you take into account the fact that we have more racial diversity and more poverty, it makes a big difference. There are great public schools where there\u2019s public school choice, accountability and brilliant principals. I\u2019ll just mention one \u2014 the Beasley Academic Center in Chicago. I commend it to anybody. It\u2019s as good as any private school in the country."}

Congress \u2014 they\u2019re all good people. They\u2019re all patriots but you\u2019ve got to link arms and work with them. Sure, you\u2019ll have arguments. Sure, you\u2019ll have fights. We have them all day every day. But we get the job done. Now, I have to come back in my clothes to one thing because I am passionate about education. I was talking about early childhood education for disadvantaged little children. And let me tell you one specific pilot program where children who don\u2019t have a chance go to this program when they\u2019re 3. Now we\u2019re going back to when the mother\u2019s pregnant and they\u2019ll start right after they\u2019re born. Starting when they\u2019re 3 and going to this school until they\u2019re 9 and then going into the public school in the 4th grade. Ninety percent are on the honor role. Now that will change America. Those children will all go to college. They will live the American dream. And I beg the American people, any time they think about reforming education to take this piece of society that doesn\u2019t have a chance and take these little pieces of clay that can be shaped and molded and give them the same love and nurture and affection and support you give your children and teach them that they\u2019re unique and that they\u2019re precious and that there\u2019s only one person in the world like them and you will see this nation bloom.

I thought I owed that to you and I respect you for being here and for the impact you\u2019ve had on making this a more positive experience. These problems are not easy. They\u2019re not going to be solved overnight. But I want you to think about just 2 or 3 things. First of all, the people of my state have let me be their governor for 12 years because I made commitments to 2 things \u2014 more jobs and better schools. Our schools are now better. Our children get off to a better start from pre-school programs and smaller classes in the early grades, and we have one of the most aggressive adult education programs in the country. We talked about that. This year my state ranks first in the country in job growth, 4th in manufacturing in job growth, 4th in income growth, 4th in the decline of poverty. I\u2019m proud of that. It happened because I could work with people \u2014 Republicans and Democrats. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve had 24 retired generals and admirals, hundreds of business people, many of them Republican, support this campaign. You have to decide whether you want to change or not. We do not need 4 more years of an economic theory that doesn\u2019t work. We\u2019ve had 12 years of trickle down economics. It\u2019s time to put the American people first, to invest and grow this economy. I\u2019m the only person here who\u2019s ever balanced a government budget and I\u2019ve presented 12 of them and cut spending repeatedly. But you cannot just get there by balancing the budget. We\u2019ve got to grow the economy by putting people first \u2014 real people like you. I got into this race because I did not want my child to grow up to be part of the first generation of Americans to do worse than her parents. We\u2019re better than that. We can do better than that. I want to make America as great as it can be and I ask for your help in doing it. Thank you very much."}

The wealthiest Americans have been taxed much less, even though their incomes have gone up. Middle-class people will have their fair share of changing to do, and many challenges to face, including the challenge of becoming constantly re-educated. But my plan is a departure from trickle-down economics, just cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans and getting out of the way. It\u2019s also a departure from tax-and- spend economics, because you can\u2019t tax and divide an economy that isn\u2019t growing. I propose an American version of what works in other countries \u2014 I think we can do it better: invest and grow. I believe we can increase investment and reduce the deficit at the same time, if we not only ask the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their share; we also provide over $100 billion in tax relief, in terms of incentives for new plants, new small businesses, new technologies, new housing, and for middle class families; and we have $140 billion of spending cuts. Invest and grow. Raise some more money, spend the money on tax incentives to have growth in the private sector, take the money from the defense cuts and reinvest it in new transportation and communications and environmental clean-up systems. This will work. On this, as on so many other issues, I have a fundamental difference from the present administration. I don\u2019t believe trickle down economics will work. Unemployment is up. Most people are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago. I think we can do better if we have the courage to change."}

The rich are paying a bigger percent of the total tax burden. And what I don\u2019t like is trickle down government. And therein, I think Governor Clinton keeps talking about trickle down, trickle down, and he\u2019s still talking about spending more and taxing more. Government \u2014 he says invest government, grow government. Government doesn\u2019t create jobs. If they do, they\u2019re make-work jobs. It\u2019s the private sector that creates jobs. And yes, we\u2019ve got too many taxes on the American people and we\u2019re spending too much. And that\u2019s why I want to get the deficit down by controlling the growth of mandatory spending. It won\u2019t be painless. I think Mr. Perot put his finger on something there. It won\u2019t be painless but we\u2019ve got to get the job done. But not by raising taxes. Mr. and Mrs. America, when you hear him say we\u2019re going to tax only the rich, watch your wallet because his figures don\u2019t add up and he\u2019s going to sock it right to the middle class taxpayer and lower, if he\u2019s going to pay for all the spending programs he proposes. So we have a big difference on this trickle down theory. I do not want any more trickle down government. It\u2019s gotten too big. I want to do something about that."}

If you forecast it out, we still have a significant deficit under each of their plans, as I understand them. Our challenge is to stop the financial bleeding. If you take a patient into the hospital that\u2019s bleeding arterially, step one is to stop the bleeding. And we are bleeding arterially. There\u2019s only one way out of this, and that is to stop the deterioration of our job base, to have a growing, expanding job base, to give us the tax base \u2014 see, balancing the budget is not nearly as difficult as paying off the $4 trillion debt and leaving our children the American dream intact. We have spent their money. We\u2019ve got to pay it back. This is going to take fair, shared sacrifice. My plan balances the budget within 6 years. We didn\u2019t do it faster than that because we didn\u2019t want to disrupt the economy. We gave it off to a slow start and a fast finish to give the economy time to recover. But we faced it and we did it, and we believe it\u2019s fair, shared sacrifice. The one thing I have done is lay it squarely on the table in front of the American people. You\u2019ve had a number of occasions to see in detail what the plan is, and at least you\u2019ll understand it. I think that\u2019s fundamental in our country, that you know what you\u2019re getting into."}

For one thing, let me just follow up here. I disagree with Mr. Perot that the answer is to raise \u2014 put a 50-cent gas tax on the middle class and raise more taxes on the middle class and the working poor than on the wealthy. His own analysis says that unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 under his plan than it is today. And as far as what Mr. Bush says, he is the person who raised taxes on the middle class after saying he wouldn\u2019t. And just this year, Mr. Bush vetoed a tax increase on the wealthy that gave middle class tax relief. He vetoed middle class tax relief this year. And furthermore, under this administration, spending has increased more than it has in the last 20 years and he asked Congress to spend more money than it actually spent. Now, it\u2019s hard to out-spend Congress but he tried to for the last 3 years. So my view is the middle class is the \u2014 they\u2019ve been suffering, Jim. Now, should people pay more for Medicare if they can? Yes. Should they pay more for Social Security if they get more out of it than they paid in, they\u2019re upper income people? Yes. But look what\u2019s happened to the middle class. Middle class Americans are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago and they\u2019re paying higher taxes. The tax burden on them has not gone down. It has gone up. I don\u2019t think the answer is to slow the economy down more, drive unemployment up more and undermine the health of the private sector. The answer is to invest and grow this economy. That\u2019s what works in other countries and that\u2019s what\u2019ll work here."}

I think it\u2019s important to elect a president who is committed to getting this economy going again, and who realizes we have to abandon trickle-down economics and put the American people first again, and who will send programs to the Congress in the first hundred days to deal with the critical issues that America is crying out for leadership on \u2014 jobs, incomes, the health care crisis, the need to control the economy.

The misery index \u2014 unemployment and inflation added together \u2014 it was invented by the Democrats \u2014 went right through the roof. We\u2019ve cut it in half.

Of course he\u2019s not, but he\u2019s not gonna be better off if we grow the government, if we invest, as Governor Clinton says, invest in more government.

I did everything I could to get General Motors to face its problems in the mid-\u201980s while it was still financially strong. They just wouldn\u2019t do it, and everybody now knows the terrible price they\u2019re paying by waiting until it\u2019s obvious to the brain-dead that they have problems. Now, hundreds, thousands of good, decent people, whole cities up here in this state are adversely impacted because they would not move in a timely way. Our government is that point now. The thing that I am in this race for is to tap the American people on the shoulder and to say to every single one of you, fix it while we\u2019re still relatively strong. If you have a heart problem, you don\u2019t wait till a heart attack to address it. So the General Motors experience is relevant. At the point when I could not get them to address those problems, I had created so much stress in the board, who wanted to just keep the Lawrence Welk music going, that they asked to buy my remaining shares. I sold them my remaining shares. They went their way. I went my way because it was obvious we had a complete disagreement about what should be done with the company. But let\u2019s take my life in perspective. Again and again, on complex, difficult tasks, I have stayed the course. When I was asked by our government to do the POW project, within a year the Vietnamese had sent people into Canada to make arrangements to have me and my family killed. And I had 5 small children, and my family and I decided we would stay the course, and we lived with that problem for 3 years. Then I got into the Texas War on Drugs program and the big-time drug dealers got all upset. Then when I had 2 people imprisoned in Iran, I could have left them there. I could have rationalized it. We went over, we got them out, we brought them back home. And since then, for years, I have lived with the burden of the Middle East, where it\u2019s eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth country, in terms of their unhappiness with the fact that I was successful in that effort. Again and again and again, in the middle of the night, at 2 or 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, my government has called me to take extraordinary steps for Americans in distress, and again and again and again I have responded. And I didn\u2019t wilt and I didn\u2019t quit. Now, what happened in July we\u2019ve covered again and again and again. But I think in terms of the American people\u2019s concern about my commitment, I\u2019m here tonight, folks; I never quit supporting you as you put me on the ballot in the other 26 states; and when you asked me to come back in, I came back in. And talk about not quitting, I\u2019m spending my money on this campaign; the 2 parties are spending your money, taxpayer money. I put my wallet on the table for you and your children. Over $60 million at least will go into this campaign to leave the American dream to you and your children, to get this country straightened out, because if anybody owes it to you, I do.

I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that the automobile executives made some errors in the 1980s, but I also think we should look at how much productivity has increased lately, how much labor has done to increase productivity and how much management has done. And we\u2019re still losing a lot of auto jobs, in my judgment, because we don\u2019t have a national economic strategy that will build the industrial base of this country. Just today I met with the presidents and the vice presidents of the Willow Run union here, near here. They both said they were Vietnam veterans supporting me because I had an economic program to put them back to work. We need an investment incentive to modernize plant and equipment; we\u2019ve got to control the health care costs for those people \u2014 otherwise we can\u2019t keep the manufacturing jobs here; and we need a tough trade policy that is fair, that insists on open markets in return for open markets. We ought to have a strategy that will build the economic and industrial base. So I think Mr. Perot was right in questioning the management practices. But they didn\u2019t have much of a partner in government here as compared with the policies the Germans and the Japanese followed, and I believe we can do better.

But one mistake he\u2019s made is fuel efficiency standards at 40 to 45 miles a gallon will throw many auto workers out of work, and you can\u2019t have it both ways.

I think that should be a goal. I have never said we should write it into law if there is evidence that that goal cannot be achieved. The Natl Science Foundation did a study which said it would be difficult for us to reach fuel efficiency standards in excess of 37 miles per gallon by the year 2000. I think we should try to raise the fuel efficiency. And let me say this. I think we ought to have incentives to do it, I think we ought to push to do it. That doesn\u2019t mean we have to write it into the law. Look, I am a job creator, not a job destroyer. It is the Bush administration that has had no new jobs in the private sector in the last 4 years. In my state, we\u2019re leading the country in private sector job growth.

You implement that NAFTA, the Mexican trade agreement, where they pay people a dollar an hour, have no health care, no retirement, no pollution controls, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and you\u2019re going to hear a giant sucking sound of jobs being pulled out of this country right at a time when we need the tax base to pay the debt and pay down the interest on the debt and get our house back in order. We\u2019ve got to proceed very carefully on that. See, there\u2019s a lot I don\u2019t understand. I do understand business. I do understand creating jobs. I do understand how to make things work. And I got a long history of doing that. Now, if you want to go to the core problem that faces everybody in manufacturing in this country, it\u2019s that agreement that\u2019s about to be put into practice. It\u2019s very simple. Everybody says it\u2019ll create jobs. Yes, it\u2019ll create bubble jobs. Now, you know, watch this \u2014 listen very carefully to this. One-time surge while we build factories and ship machine tools and equipment down there. Then year after year for decades, they will have jobs. And I finally \u2014 I thought I didn\u2019t understand it \u2014 called all the experts, and they said, oh, it\u2019ll be disruptive for 12 to 15 years. We haven\u2019t got 12 days, folks. We cannot lose those jobs. They were eventually saying, Mexican jobs will eventually come to $7.50 an hour, ours will eventually go down to $7.50 an hour. Makes you feel real good to hear that, right? Let\u2019s think it through here. Let\u2019s be careful. I\u2019m for free trade philosophically, but I have studied these trade agreements till the world has gone flat, and we don\u2019t have good trade agreements across the world. I hope we\u2019ll have a chance to get into that tonight, because I can get right to the center of the bull\u2019s-eye and tell you why we\u2019re losing whole industries in this country."}

Ross says, with great conviction, he opposes the North American Free Trade Agreement. I am for the North American Free Trade Agreement. My problem with Governor Clinton, once again, is that one time he\u2019s gonna make up his mind, he sees some merit in it, but then he sees a lot of things wrong with it. Then the other day he says he\u2019s for it, however then we\u2019ve got to pass other legislation. When you\u2019re president of the US, you cannot have this pattern of saying well, I\u2019m for it but I\u2019m on the other side of it. And it\u2019s true on this and it\u2019s true on CAFE. Look, if Ross were right when we get a free trade agreement with Mexico, why wouldn\u2019t they have gone down there now? You have a differential in wages right now. I just have an honest philosophical difference. I think free trade is going to expand our job opportunity. I think it is exports that have saved us when we\u2019re in a global slowdown, a connected global slowdown, a recession in some countries. And it\u2019s free trade, fair trade that needs to be our hallmark, and we need more free trade agreements, not fewer."}

You know, Mr. Bush was very grateful when I was among the Democrats who said he ought to have the authority to negotiate an agreement with Mexico. Neither I nor anybody else, as far a I know, agreed to give him our proxy to say that whatever he did was fine for the workers of this country and for the interests of this country. I am the one who\u2019s in the middle on this. Mr. Perot says it\u2019s a bad deal. Mr. Bush says it\u2019s a hunky-dory deal. I say on balance it does more good than harm if, if we can get some protection for the environment so that the Mexicans have to follow their own environmental standards, their own labor law standards, and if we have a genuine commitment to reeducate and retrain the American workers who lose their jobs and reinvest in this economy. I have a realistic approach to trade. I want more trade, and I know there are some good things in that agreement. But it can sure be made better. Let me just point out, just today in the Los Angeles Times Clyde Prestowitz, who was one of President Reagan\u2019s leading trade advisers and a life-long conservative Republican, endorsed my candidacy because he knows that I\u2019ll have a free and fair trade policy, a hard-headed, realistic policy, and not get caught up in rubber-stamping everything the Bush administration did. If I wanted to do that, why would I run for president, Jim? Anybody else can run the middle class down and run the economy in a ditch. I want to change it."}

Our country has sold out to foreign lobbyists. We don\u2019t have free trade. Both parties have foreign lobbyists on leaves in key roles in their campaigns. And if there\u2019s anything more unwise than that, I don\u2019t know what it is. Every debate I bring this up, and nobody ever addresses it. I would like for them to look you in the eye and tell you why they have people representing foreign countries working on their campaigns. And you know, you\u2019ve seen the list, I\u2019ve seen the list, we won\u2019t go into the names, but no wonder they \u2014 if I had those people around me all day every day, telling me it was fair and free, I might believe it. But if I look at the facts as a businessman, it\u2019s so tilted, the first thing you ought to do is just say, guys, if you like these deals so well, we\u2019ll give you the deal you gave us. Now, Japanese couldn\u2019t unload the cars in this country if they had the same restrictions we had, and on and on and on and on and on. I suggest to you that the core problem \u2014 1 country spent $400 million lobbying in 1988, our country. And it goes on and on. And you look at a who\u2019s who in these campaigns around the 2 candidates. They\u2019re foreign lobbyists taking leaves. What do you think they\u2019re going to do when the campaign\u2019s over? Go back to work at 30,000 bucks a month representing some other country. I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s in the American people\u2019s interest. I don\u2019t have a one of them, and I haven\u2019t taken a penny of foreign money, and I never will."}

And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with an honest person who happens to represent an interest of another country for making his case. That\u2019s the American way. And what you\u2019re assuming is that that makes the recipient of the lobbying corrupt or the lobbyist himself corrupt. I don\u2019t agree with that. But if I found somebody that had a conflict of interest that would try to illegally do something as a foreign \u2014 registered lobby, the laws cover this. I don\u2019t know why \u2014 I\u2019ve never understood quite why Mr. Perot was so upset it, because one of the guys he used to have working for him, I believe, had foreign accounts.

We\u2019re getting ready to dismantle the airlines industry in our country, and none of you know it. And I doubt in all candor if the president knows it. But this deal that we\u2019re doing with BAC and US Air and KLM and Northwest, guess who\u2019s on the president\u2019s campaign big time: a guy from Northwest. This deal is terribly destructive to the US airline industry. One of the largest industries in the world is the travel and tourist business. We won\u2019t be making airplanes in this country 10 years from now if we let deals like this go through. If the president has any interest tonight, I\u2019ll detail it to you; I won\u2019t take 10 minutes tonight. All these things take a few minutes. But that\u2019s happening as we sit here today. We hammerlock the American companies \u2014 American Airlines, Delta \u2014 the last few great we have, because we\u2019re trying to do this deal with these 2 European companies. And never forget, they\u2019ve got Airbus over there, and it\u2019s a government-owned, privately owned, consortium across Europe. They\u2019re dying to get the commercial airline business. Japan is trying to get the commercial airline business. I don\u2019t think there are any villains inside government on this issue, but there\u2019s sure a lot of people who don\u2019t understand business. And maybe you need somebody up there who understands when you\u2019re getting your pocket picked."}

I think Ross is right and that we do need some more restrictions on lobbyists. We ought to make them disclose the people they\u2019ve given money to when they\u2019re testifying before congressional committees; we ought to close the lawyers\u2019 loopholes; they ought to have to disclose when they\u2019re really lobbying. And we ought to have to limit \u2014 we ought to have a much longer period of time, about 5 years, between the time when people can leave executive branch offices and then go out and start lobbying for foreign interests. I agree with that. We\u2019ve wrecked the airline industry already because of all these leverage buyouts and all these terrible things that have happened to the airline industry. We\u2019re going to have a hard time rebuilding it. But the real thing we got to have is a competitive economic strategy. Look what\u2019s happening to McDonnell Douglas; even Boeing is losing market share \u2014 because we let the Europeans spend $25-$40 billion on Airbus without an appropriate competitive response. What I want America to do is to trade more but to compete and win by investing in competitive ways. And we\u2019re in real trouble on that."}

You know, I\u2019d been in public life a long time and no one had ever questioned my role and so I was asked a lot of questions about things that happened a long time ago and I don\u2019t think I answered them as well as I could have. Going back 23 years, I don\u2019t know, Helen. I was opposed to the war. I couldn\u2019t help that. I felt very strongly about it, and I didn\u2019t want to go at the time. It\u2019s easy to say in retrospect I would have done something differently. President Lincoln opposed the war and there were people who said maybe he shouldn\u2019t be president, but I think he made us a pretty good president in wartime. We\u2019ve had a lot of other presidents who didn\u2019t wear their country\u2019s uniform who had to order our young soldiers into battle, including President Wilson and President Roosevelt. So the answer is I could do that. I wouldn\u2019t relish doing it but I wouldn\u2019t shrink from it. I think that the president has to be prepared to use the power of the nation when our vital interests are threatened, when our treaty commitments are at stake, when we know that something has to be done that is in the national interest, and that is a part of being president. Could I do it? Yes, I could."}

My argument with him on \u2014 the question was about the draft \u2014 is that there\u2019s this same pattern. In New Hampshire Senator Kerrey said you ought to level, you ought to tell the truth about it. On April 17 he said he\u2019d bring out all the records on the draft. They have not been forthcoming. He got a deferment or he didn\u2019t. He got a notice or he didn\u2019t. And I think it\u2019s this pattern that troubles me, more than the draft. A lot of decent, honorable people felt as he did on the draft. But it\u2019s this pattern. And again, you might be able to make amendments all the time, Governor, but you\u2019ve got to, as president, you can\u2019t be on all these different sides, and you can\u2019t have this pattern of saying well, I did this or I didn\u2019t, then the facts come out and you change it.

I believe that \u2014 I believe I made a mistake. I did it for the very reasons you say. There was one good thing that came out of that budget agreement, and that is we put a cap on discretionary spending. One-third of the president\u2019s budget is at the president\u2019s discretion, or really the Congress, since they appropriate every dime and tell a president how to spend every dime. We\u2019ve put a cap on the growth of all that spending, and that\u2019s good and that\u2019s helped. But I was wrong because I thought the tax compromise, going along with 1 Democratic tax increase, would help the economy. I see no evidence that it has done it. So what would I have done? What should I have done? I should have held out for a better deal that would have protected the taxpayer and not ended up doing what we had to do, or what I thought at the time would help. So I made a mistake, and I \u2014 you know, the difference, I think, is that I knew at the time I was going to take a lot of political flak. I knew we\u2019d have somebody out there yelling \u201cread my lips\u201d, and I did it because I thought it was right. And I made a mistake.

The choices were not good then. I think at the time, the mistake that was made was signing off on the deal late on Saturday night in the middle of the night. That\u2019s just what the president did when he vetoed the Family Leave Act. I think what he should have done is gone before the American people on the front end and said listen, I made a commitment and it was wrong.

And the average citizen out here is just working hard every day. You\u2019ve got to go to the people. I just love the fact that everybody, particularly in the media, goes bonkers over the town hall. I guess it\u2019s because you will lose your right to tell them what to think. The point is, they\u2019ll get to decide what to think. (Laughter and applause) I love the fact that people will listen to a guy with a bad accent and a poor presentation manner talking about flip charts for 30 minutes, because they want the details. See, all the folks up there at the top said the attention span of the American people is no more than 5 minutes, they won\u2019t watch it. They\u2019re thirsty for it. You want to have a new program in this country. If you get grassroots America excited about it, and if they tap Congress on the shoulder and say do it, Charlie, it\u2019ll happen. And that\u2019s a whole lot different from these fellows running up and down the halls whispering in their ears now and promising campaign funds for the next election if they do it. Now, I think that\u2019s going back to where we started. That\u2019s having a government from the people. I think that\u2019s the essence of leadership, rather than cutting deals in dark rooms in Washington."}

Of the 3 of us, I have balanced a government budget 12 times, I have offered and passed campaign finance reform, offered, pushed for and passed in public referendum lobbyist restrictions, done the kinds of things you have to do to get legislators together not only to establish consensus but to challenge them to change. And in 12 years as governor I guess I\u2019ve taken on every interest group there was in my state at one time or another to fight for change. It can be done.

Look, you have to build a consensus, but in some things \u2014 Ross mentioned Saddam Hussein. Yes, we tried, and, yes, we failed to bring him into the family of nations; he had the 4th largest army. But then when he moved against Kuwait, I said this will not stand. And it\u2019s hard to build a consensus. We went to the UN, we made historic resolutions up there, the whole world was united, our Congress was dragging its feet. Governor Clinton said, well, I might have been with the minority, let sanctions work \u2014 but I guess I would have voted with the majority. A president can\u2019t do that. Sometimes he has to act. And in this case I\u2019m glad we did, because if we had let sanctions work and tried to build a consensus on that, Saddam Hussein today would be in Saudi Arabia controlling the world\u2019s oil supply, and he would be there maybe with a nuclear weapon.

So we have a long history of having a lot of talented women. One of our first officers was a woman, the chief financial officer. She was a director. And it was so far back, it was considered so odd, and even though we were a tiny, little company at the time, it made all the national magazines. But in terms of being influenced by women and being a minority, there they are right out there, my wife and my 4 beautiful daughters, and I just have 1 son, so he and I are surrounded by women, giving \u2014 telling us what to do all the time. (Laughter) And the rest of my minute, I want to make a very brief comment here in terms of Saddam Hussein. We told him that we wouldn\u2019t get involved with his border dispute, and we\u2019ve never revealed those papers that were given to Ambassador Glaspie on July the 25th. I suggest, in the sense of taking responsibility for your actions, we lay those papers on the table. They\u2019re not the secrets to the nuclear bomb. Secondly, we got upset when he took the whole thing, but to the ordinary American out there who doesn\u2019t know where the oil fields are in Kuwait, they\u2019re near the border. We told him he could take the northern part of Kuwait, and when he took the whole thing, we went nuts. And if we didn\u2019t tell him that, why won\u2019t we even let the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee see the written instructions for Ambassador Glaspie?"}

And talk to any head of any of those key committees in the Senate. They will not let them see the written instructions given to Ambassador Glaspie.

There are many. But I think even more relevant is my record at home. For most of my time as governor a woman was my chief of staff. An African American was my chief cabinet officer. An African American was my chief economic development officer. It was interesting today. There was a story today or yesterday in the Washington Post about my economic programs and my chief budget officer and my chief economic officer were both African Americans, even though the Post didn\u2019t mention that, which I think is a sign of progress. The Natl Women\u2019s Political Caucus gave me an award, one of their Good Guy Awards, for my involvement of women in high levels of government, and I\u2019ve appointed more minorities to positions of high level in government than all the governors in the history of my state combined, before me. So that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do as president. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve got a person to waste and I think I owe the American people a White House staff, a Cabinet and appointments that look like America but that meet high standards of excellence, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do."}

And then after the Republican dirty tricks group got through with me I\u2019m another person, which I consider an absolutely sick operation. And all of you in the press know exactly what I\u2019m talking about. They investigated every single one of my children. They investigated my wife. They interviewed all of my children\u2019s friends from childhood on. They went to extraordinary sick lengths, and I just found it amusing that they would take 2 or 3 cases where I was involved in lawsuits and would engage an investigator \u2014 the lawyers would engage an investigator, which is common. And the only difference between me and any other businessman that has the range of businesses that I have is I haven\u2019t had that many lawsuits. So that\u2019s just another one of those little fruit-loopy things they make up to try to, instead of facing issues, to try to redefine a person that\u2019s running against them. This goes on night and day. I will do everything I can, if I get up there, to make dirty tricks a thing of the past. One of the 2 groups has raised it to an art form. It\u2019s a sick art form. Now, let\u2019s go back to Saddam Hussein. We gave Ambassador Glaspie written instructions. That\u2019s a fact. We\u2019ve never let the Congress and the Foreign Relations, Senate Intelligence Committees see them. That\u2019s a fact. Ambassador Glaspie did a lot of talking right after July 25 and that\u2019s a fact and it\u2019s in all the newspapers. And you pull all of it at once and read it and I did, and it\u2019s pretty clear what she and Kelly and the other key guys around that thing thought they were doing. Then at the end of the war, when they had to go testify about it, their stories are a total disconnect from what they said in August, September and October. So I say this is very simple. Saddam Hussein released a tape, as you know, claiming it was a transcript of their meeting, where she said we will not become involved in your border dispute and, in effect, you can take the northern part of the country. We later said no, that\u2019s not true. I said well, this is simple. What were her written instructions? We guard those like the secrets of the atomic bomb, literally. Now, I say whose country is this? This is ours. Who will get hurt if we lay those papers on the table? The worst thing is, again, it\u2019s a mistake. Nobody did any of this with evil intent. I just object to the fact that we cover up and hide things. Whether it\u2019s Iran-contra, Iraq-gate or you name it, it\u2019s a steady stream."}

And let\u2019s give him the credit he deserves for organizing Operation Desert Storm and Desert Shield. It was a remarkable event. But let\u2019s look at where I think the real mistake was made. In 1988 when the war between Iraq and Iran ended, we knew Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, we had dealt with him because he was against Iran \u2014 the enemy of my enemy maybe is my friend. All right, the war\u2019s over; we know he\u2019s dropping mustard gas on his own people, we know he\u2019s threatened to incinerate half of Israel. Several government departments \u2014 several \u2014 had information that he was converting our aid to military purposes and trying to develop weapons of mass destruction. But in late \u201989 the president signed a secret policy saying we were going to continue to try to improve relations with him, and we sent him some sort of communication on the eve of his invasion of Kuwait that we still wanted better relations. So I think what was wrong \u2014 I give credit where credit is due \u2014 but the responsibility was in coddling Saddam Hussein when there was no reason to do it and when people at high levels in our government knew he was trying to do things that were outrageous."}

We did try to bring Saddam Hussein into the family of nations; he did have the 4th largest army. All our Arab allies out there thought we ought to do just exactly that. And when he crossed the line, I stood up and looked into the camera and I said: This aggression will not stand. And we formed a historic coalition, and we brought him down, and we destroyed the 4th largest army. And the battlefield was searched, and there wasn\u2019t one single iota of evidence that any US weapons were on that battlefield. And the nuclear capability has been searched by the United Nations, and there hasn\u2019t been one single scintilla of evidence that there\u2019s any US technology involved in it. And what you\u2019re seeing on all this Iraq-gate is a bunch of people who were wrong on the war trying to cover their necks here and try to do a little revisionism. And I cannot let that stand, because it isn\u2019t true. Yes, we had grain credits for Iraq, and there isn\u2019t any evidence that those grain credits were diverted into weaponry \u2014 none, none whatsoever. And so I just have to say, it\u2019s fine. You can\u2019t stand there, Governor Clinton, and say, well, I think I\u2019d have been \u2014 I have supported the minority, let sanctions work or wish it would go away \u2014 but I would have voted with the majority.

On the other hand, I don\u2019t think that we have any reason to believe that the dimensions of this crisis are anywhere near as great as the savings and loan crisis. The mistake that both parties made in Washington with the S&L business was deregulating them without proper capital requirements, proper oversight and regulation, proper training of the executives. Many people predicted what happened, and it was a disaster. The banking system in this country is fundamentally sound with some weak banks. I think that our goal ought to be first of all not to politicize it, not to frighten people; secondly to say that we have to enforce the law in 2 ways. We don\u2019t want to overreact, as the federal regulators have in my judgment, on good banks so that they\u2019ve created credit crunches, that is, they have made our recession worse in the last couple of years \u2014 but we do want to act prudently with the banks that are in trouble. We also want to say that insofar as is humanly possible the banking industry itself should pay for the cost of any bank failures; the taxpayers should not. And that will be my policy. And I believe if we have a good balanced approach, we can get the good banks loaning money again, end the credit crunch, have proper regulation on the ones that are in trouble, and not overreact. It is a serious problem, but I don\u2019t see it as the kind of terrible, terrible problem that the S&L problem was."}

It is sound. There are some problem banks out there. But what we need is financial reform; we need some real financial reform, banking reform legislation. And I have proposed that. And when I am re-elected, I believe one of the first things ought to be to press a new Congress not beholden to the old ways to pass financial reform legislation that modernizes the banking system, doesn\u2019t put a lot of inhibitions on it, and protects the depositors through keeping the FDIC sound. But I think that \u2014 I just was watching some of the proceedings of the American Bankers Assn, and I think the general feeling is most of the banks are sound, certainly there\u2019s no comparison here between what happened to the S&Ls and where the banks stand right now, in my view."}

The whole problem came up in 1984. The president of the US was told officially it was a $20-billion problem. These crooks \u2014 now, Willie Sutton would have gone to own a savings and loan rather than rob banks, because he robbed banks because that\u2019s where the money is; owning a savings and loan is where the money was. Now, in 1984 they were told. I believe the vice president was in charge of deregulation. Nobody touched that tar baby till the day after election in 1988 because they were flooding both parties with crooked PAC money, and it was in many cases stolen PAC money. Now, you and I never got a ride on a lot of these yachts and fancy things it bought, but you and I are paying for it. And they buried it till right after the election. Now, if you believe The Washington Post and you believe this extensive study that\u2019s been done \u2014 and I\u2019m reading it \u2014 right after election day this year they\u2019re going to hit us with a hundred banks, it will be a $100-billion problem. Now, if that\u2019s true, just tell me now. I\u2019m grownup, I can deal with it, I\u2019ll pay my share. But just tell me now; don\u2019t bury until after the election twice.

And it\u2019s a long list of specific items. And I\u2019ve covered it again and again in print and on television. But very specifically the key thing is to turn the government back to the people and take it away from the special interests and have people go to Washington to serve.

Now, when you out-spend Congress you\u2019re really swinging. That, however, is not my only passion. The real problem in this country is that most people are working hard and falling farther behind. My passion is to pass a jobs program and get incomes up with an investment incentive program to grow jobs in the private sector, to waste less public money and invest more, to control health care costs and provide for affordable health care for all Americans and to make sure we\u2019ve got the best trained workforce in the world.

I am not gonna raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs. Now furthermore, I am not gonna tell you \u201cread my lips\u201d on anything because I cannot foresee what emergencies might develop in this country. And the president said never, never, never would he raise taxes in New Jersey, and within a day Marlin Fitzwater, his spokesman, said now, that\u2019s not a promise. So I think even he has learned that you can\u2019t say \u201cread my lips\u201d because you can\u2019t know what emergencies might come up. But I can tell you this. I\u2019m not gonna raise taxes on middle class Americans to pay for the programs I\u2019ve recommended. Read my plan. And you know how you can trust me about that? Because you know, in the first debate, Mr. Bush made some news. He\u2019d just said Jim Baker was going to be secretary of state and in the first debate he said no, now he\u2019s gonna be responsible for domestic economic policy. Well, I\u2019ll tell ya. I\u2019ll make some news in the 3rd debate. The person responsible for domestic economic policy in my administration will be Bill Clinton. I\u2019m gonna make those decisions, and I won\u2019t raise taxes on the middle class to pay for my programs."}

He\u2019s going to do \u2014 and he would do for the US what he\u2019s done to Arkansas. He would do for the US what he\u2019s done to Arkansas. We do not want to be the lowest of the low. We are not a nation in decline. We are a rising nation. Now, my problem is \u2014 I heard what he said. He said I want to take it from the rich, raise $150 billion from the rich. To get it, to get $150 billion in new taxes, you got to go down to the guy that\u2019s making $36,600. And if you want to pay for the rest of his plan, all the other spending programs, you\u2019re going to sock it to the working man. So when you hear \u201ctax the rich,\u201d Mr. and Mrs. America, watch your wallet. Lock your wallet because he\u2019s coming right after you just like Jimmy Carter did and just like you\u2019re going to get \u2014 you\u2019re going to end up with interest rates at 21%, and you\u2019re going to have inflation going through the roof.

So let\u2019s come back to harsh reality, and what I \u2014 you know, everybody says, gee, Perot, you\u2019re tough. I\u2019m saying, well, this is not as tough as World War II and it\u2019s not as tough as the revolution.

Why I\u2019ll win is I think I have the best plan of the 3 of us up here to do something about it. Mine does not grow the government, it does not invest, have government invest. It says we need to do better in terms of stimulating private business. We got a big philosophical difference here tonight between one who thinks the government can do all these things through tax and spend, and one who thinks it ought to go the other way. And so I believe the answer is, I\u2019m going to win it because I\u2019m getting into focus my agenda for America\u2019s renewal, and also I think that Governor Clinton\u2019s had pretty much of a free ride. On looking specifically at the Arkansas record \u2014 he keeps criticizing us, criticizing me, I\u2019m the incumbent, fine. But he\u2019s an incumbent, and we\u2019ve got to look at all the facts. They\u2019re almost at the bottom on every single category. We can\u2019t do that to the American people. And then, Helen, I really believe where people are going to ask this question about trust, because I do think there\u2019s a pattern by Governor Clinton of saying one thing to please one group, and then trying to please another group. And I think that pattern is a dangerous thing to suggest would work for the Oval Office. It doesn\u2019t work that way when you\u2019re president. Truman is right. The buck stops there. And you have to make decisions even when it\u2019s against your own interest. And I\u2019ve done that. It\u2019s against my political interest to say go ahead and go along with the tax increase, but I did what I thought was right at the time. So I think people are going to be looking for trust and experience. And then, I mentioned it the other night, I think if there\u2019s a crisis, people are going to say, well, George Bush has taken us through some tough crises, and we trust him to do that. And so I\u2019ll make the appeal on a wide array of issues. Also I got a philosophical difference. I got to watch the clock here. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re a declining nation. The whole world has had economic problems. We\u2019re doing better than a lot of the countries in the world. And we\u2019re going to lead the way out of this economic recession across this world and economic slowdown here at home."}

I\u2019m totally focussed on the fact that we still could have enterprise zones, according to both parties, but we don\u2019t. So I am still focussed on gridlock, I guess. And I am also focussed on the fact that isn\u2019t it a paradox that we have the highest productivity in our workforce in the industrialized world and at the same time have the largest trade deficit, and at the same time rank behind 9 other nations in what we pay our most productive people in the world, and we\u2019re losing whole industries overseas. Now, can\u2019t somebody agree with me that the government is breaking business\u2019s legs with these trade agreements? They\u2019re breaking business\u2019s legs in a number of different ways. We have an adversarial relationship that\u2019s destroying jobs and sending them overseas while we have the finest workers in the world. Keep in mind a factory worker has nothing to do with anything except putting it together on the factory floor. It\u2019s our obligation to make sure that we give him the finest products in the world to put together and we don\u2019t break his legs in the process."}

I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be reelected because trickle down economics is a failure and he\u2019s offering more of it, and what he\u2019s saying about my program is just not true.

Look at the 24 generals and admirals, retired, that have endorsed me, including the deputy commander of Desert Storm. Look at Sarah Brady, Jim Brady\u2019s wife, President Reagan\u2019s press secretary, who endorsed me because he knuckled under to the NRA and wouldn\u2019t fight for the Brady Bill.

I think the real winners of the debates were the American people. I was especially moved in Richmond a few days ago when 209 of our fellow citizens got to ask us questions. They went a long way toward reclaiming this election for the American people and taking their country back. I want to say, since this is the last time I\u2019ll be on a platform with my opponents, that even though I disagree with Mr. Perot on how fast we can reduce the deficit and how much we can increase taxes on the middle class, I really respect what he\u2019s done in this campaign to bring the issue of deficit reduction to our attention. I\u2019d like to say to Mr. Bush, even though I\u2019ve got profound differences with him, I do honor his service to our country. I appreciate his efforts and I wish him well. I just believe it\u2019s time to change. I offer a new approach. It\u2019s not trickle down economics. It\u2019s been tried for 12 years and it\u2019s failed. More people are working harder for less, 100,000 people a month losing their health insurance, unemployment going up, our economy slowing down. We can do better. And it\u2019s not tax and spend economics. It\u2019s invest and grow, put our people first, control health care costs and provide basic health care to all Americans, have an education system 2nd to none and revitalize the private economy. That is my commitment to you. It is the kind of change that can open up a whole new world of opportunities to America as we enter the last decade of this century and move towards the 21st century. I want a country where people who work hard and play by the rules are rewarded, not punished. I want a country where people are coming together across the lines of race and region and income. I know we can do better. It won\u2019t take miracles and it won\u2019t happen overnight, but we can do much, much better if we have the courage to change. Thank you very much."}

I don\u2019t believe in trickle-down government, I don\u2019t believe in larger taxes and larger government spending. On foreign affairs, some think it\u2019s irrelevant. I believe it\u2019s not.

So we\u2019ve seen a deterioration in values, and one of the things that I think we should do about it in terms of cause is to instill values into the young people in our schools. We got away, we got into this feeling that value- free education was the thing. And I don\u2019t believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use. And, of course, as far as the how we make it better, yes, we can do better on interdiction.

And as the governor of Massachusetts knows, there was no evidence that governor \u2013 that Mr. Noriega was involved in drugs, no hard evidence until we indicted him. And so I think it\u2019s about time we get this Noriega matter in perspective. Panama is a friendly country.

And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down, because as a chief executive that\u2019s balanced ten budgets in a row, I\u2019ve had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices. First, I\u2019ve suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don\u2019t need and we can\u2019t afford. Mr. Bush has been critical of me for that, but I think those are the kinds of tough choices you have to make. I\u2019ve also suggested that there are weapons systems that we should proceed on, and I\u2019ve outlined those in detail. Secondly, we\u2019ve got to invest in economic growth in this country, in every part of this country. Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit. Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down. And, finally, we\u2019ve got to go out there and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren\u2019t being paid to this country. It\u2019s very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected. I\u2019ve also suggested that on the domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts. We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which is what we\u2019ve been doing under this administration. We can help people to live better lives, and at the same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare, and to become productive citizens again. The thing I don\u2019t understand about Mr. Bush\u2019s approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do. He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says he\u2019s against new taxes, although he\u2019s broken that pledge at least times in the last year that I know of; he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break. He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs. If he keeps this up, he\u2019s going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics. (Laughter) But I hope you won\u2019t take my five seconds away from me. I will say this \u2013"}

That answer was about as clear as Boston harbor. (Laughter) Let me help the governor. There are so many things there, I don\u2019t quite know where to begin. When you cut capital gains, you put people to work. John Kennedy proposed cutting capital gains. Paul Tsongas, a liberal senator from Massachusetts said the dumbest thing I did was to oppose the capital gains cut. It\u2019s not going to cost the government money. It\u2019s going to increase revenues to the federal government, and it\u2019s going to create jobs. So that\u2019s one of the things that I think makes a big difference between us. Massachusetts doesn\u2019t have an enormous defense budget, but nevertheless, the governor raised taxes five different times. That happens to be a fact. And so let\u2019s kind of stay on the issue, and I have made a specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze. And it permits \u2013 economists on the East Coast and West think it\u2019s good \u2013 it permits the president to sort out the priorities, and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes."}

And presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down, but we\u2019ve got to get the Democrats \u2013 Congress under control. They do all the spending, they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime. I\u2019d like to ask the Governor to join in getting for the president what 43 governors have, the line-item veto. He has to operate in Massachusetts under a balanced budget proviso. I would like a balanced budget amendment. But the dynamics of the economy \u2013 we cut the taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years. So the problem is \u2013 it\u2019s not that the working is being taxed too little or the person working out \u2013 the woman working in some factory being taxed too little. It is that we are continuing to spend too much. So, my formula says grow at the rate of inflation. Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending. And remember the Federal deficit has come down $70 billion in one year, in 1987. And if we \u2013 and the \u2013 actually this year Congress is doing a little better in controlling the growth of spending. Spending was only up something like 4 percent. So, it isn\u2019t that we\u2019re taking too little \u2013 from taxpayer \u2013 we\u2019re spending too much still. And the formula I\u2019ve given you works, we\u2019ve put it through a good economic model, we\u2019ve got good economists on the West Coast, Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there who\u2019s a very respected economist in the \u2013 Massachusetts. And they agree, that if we can do what I\u2019ve said, we can get it down without going and socking the American taxpayer once again. Capital gains, one more point on that, please let\u2019s learn from history. A capital gains differential will increase jobs, increase risk taking, increase revenues to the Federal Government."}

Why that\u2019s more than the average teacher makes. We\u2019ve had enough of that, ladies and gentlemen.

I want to keep this economic recovery going. More Americans at work today than any time in history, a greater percentage of the work force. What I will do is permit people to buy into Medicaid. I believe that\u2019s the answer. I am proud to have been part of an administration that past the first catastrophic health bill. And in that there are some Medicaid provisions that will be very helpful to the very kind of people we\u2019re talking about here. But we\u2019ve got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work. So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program. It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then it also \u2013 I do not want to see us mandate across the board that every company has to do this, because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say, \u201cWe can\u2019t make it.\u201d And I think then you\u2019re going to see that people are put out of work.

There isn\u2019t any such thing as something free out there. It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work so the business can continue to compete. So, I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid system. I think we ought to do it by full enforcement of the catastrophic health insurance. I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience.

I was in Houston on Tuesday meeting with a group of good citizens, working citizens. All of them with little or no health insurance. One of them was a father who had been laid off a few months ago and lost his health insurance. Has an 11 year old son and can\u2019t let that son compete in sports and Little League, because he\u2019s afraid he\u2019s going to get hurt and he won\u2019t be able to provide health insurance to pay those bills. My state just became the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care and we did it with the support of the business community and labor and the health care community and with virtually everybody in the state. The fact of the matter is that employers who today are insuring their employees are paying the freight, because they\u2019re paying for those who aren\u2019t.

The problem, Mr. Bush, is that you\u2019ve cut back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and moderate income. And when you do that, you\u2019ve have homeless families. We didn\u2019t have two and a half million, or three million homeless people living on streets and in doorways in this country ten years ago. We\u2019ve got to begin to get back to the business of building and rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in this country; housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy. We\u2019ve got communities in this country increasingly where our own kids can\u2019t afford to live in the communities that they grew up in. That\u2019s an essential commitment.

And it\u2019s all a question of what our priorities are. Mr. Bush talked about values. I agree with him. What are our values? Isn\u2019t providing housing for families of low and moderate income, isn\u2019t it making possible for young families, first time home buyers to own their own home some day something that\u2019s part of the American dream? I think so. You know, back after World War II when we had hundreds of thousands of GIs who came back from the war, we didn\u2019t sit around. We went out and built housing. The government was very much involved; so was the housing industry; so was the banking industry; so were housing advocates; so were non-profit agencies; so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing. Now, that\u2019s the kind of leadership that I want to provide as president of the United States. This isn\u2019t a question of a little charity for the homeless. This is a question of organizing the housing community. I\u2019ve talked to bankers and builders and developers, the housing advocates, community development agencies, and they want leadership from Washington. Washington, by itself, can\u2019t do it all. We shouldn\u2019t expect that. But governors are ready; mayors are ready. Builders and community leaders are ready. It will require some funds, John. And we ought to be prepared to provide those funds. But that, too, will require some choices. Mr. Bush wants to spend billions and trillions on Star Wars. Well, that\u2019s a choice we have to make, isn\u2019t it? Do we spend money on that weapon system in the billions and trillions, or is providing some decent and affordable housing for families of this country something that is at least as important and probably more so. Because it\u2019s so essential to our economic strength and to our future. Now, that\u2019s the kind of presidency I believe in. And simply to say, well, the McKinney bill will do it just doesn\u2019t do. We need a president who will lead on this issue, who has had experience on this issue. It\u2019s the kind of priority that will be at the top of our list beginning in January of 1989."}

It\u2019s one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in the country. It\u2019s one of the reasons why we have a drug education and prevention program that is reaching out and helping youngsters all over our state, the kind of thing I want to do as president of the United States. You know, the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country, which gave last year 7,000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to execute. The issue of abortion is a very difficult issue, one that I think that we all have to wrestle with, we have to come to terms with. I don\u2019t favor abortion. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good thing. I don\u2019t think most people do. The question is who makes the decision.

And so I am not going to furlough men like Willie Horton, and I would meet with their, the victims of his last escapade, the rape and the brutalization of the family down there in Maryland. Maryland would not extradite Willie Horton, the man who was furloughed, the murderer, because they didn\u2019t want him to be furloughed again. And so we have a fundamental difference on this one.

But no, I\u2019m for the sanctity of life, and once that illegality is established, then we can come to grips with the penalty side, and of course there\u2019s got to be some penalties to enforce the law, whatever they may be."}

But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible. That might be the explanation, if you tell me the program. I do strongly support the WIC program. I think it is good. I think part of the answer to this haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid, to challenge the states, and maybe we\u2019re going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of these. But, Peter, so much of it is, gets into a whole other phase of things. The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in, and that leads me to the programs I\u2019m talking about in terms of education. I think that part of it is the crime infested neighborhoods, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m a strong believer in trying to control crimes in the neighborhood, why I was so pleased to be endorsed by the policemen on the beat, the Boston Police Department the other day. I think they understand my commitment to helping them in the neighborhoods. And so it\u2019s a combination of these things. But do not erode out of the system the thousand points of light. The people that are out there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and schools, the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty. I\u2019m for Head Start and moving that up. And I\u2019ve already made a proposal \u2013 and yes, it will cost some money. But I favor that. So these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I don\u2019t think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program."}

It\u2019s cut federal aid to education; it\u2019s cut Pell grants and loans to close the door to college opportunity on youngsters all over this country. And that, too, is a major difference between the vice president and me. Let me just give you one other example. We have a great many people, hundreds of thousands of people living on public assistance in this country. The 50 governors of this nation have proposed to the Congress that we help those families to get off of welfare, help those youngsters, help their mothers to become independent and self-sufficient. It\u2019s taken months and months and months to get Mr. Bush and the administration to support that legislation, and they\u2019re still resisting. That\u2019s the way you help people. Being haunted, a thousand points of light \u2013 I don\u2019t know what that means. I know what strong political leadership is. I know what\u2019s happened over the course of the past eight years.

Welfare reform is one way to do it. If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids don\u2019t lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of families, to get off of welfare, to become independent and self-sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives, the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children. That\u2019s just one example of how you can save money and improve the quality of life at the same time. In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very unwisely. One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance. Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he can\u2019t play little league ball that he can\u2019t go out on the ball field because he\u2019s afraid he\u2019s going to get hurt. And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I don\u2019t think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital. So these are the ways that you help families, you help youngsters to live better lives, and more decent lives. Were ready to go to work at the state and local level, all of us. I know the private sector is. People are all over the country. But it takes presidential leadership. It takes a commitment to being involved and the leading. And that\u2019s the kind of presidency I want to lead."}

The fact happens to be that education spending is up by the federal government; it is up. It is not down. But here\u2019s the point he misses. The federal government spends seven percent of the total on education, and the rest of the state governments and local governments and the thousand points of lightened I\u2019m talking about private schools and private church schools and things of this nature\u2013are putting up 93 percent. But the federal spending for education is up, and I want to be the education president, because I want to see us do better. We\u2019re putting more money per child into education, and we are not performing as we should. We\u2019ve gotten away fro values and the fundamentals. And I would like to urge the school superintendents and the others around the country to stand up now and keep us moving forward on a path towards real excellence. And we can do it.

Of course that\u2019s a charge that\u2019s always made against any governor who runs for the presidency. I think it was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980. Remember that, George? And yet some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest international leaders were governors-Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt. Its not the amount of time you spend in Washington. It\u2019s not the length of your resume. It\u2019s your strength, it\u2019s your values, it\u2019s the quality of the people you pick. It\u2019s your understanding of the forces of change that are sweeping the world, and whether or not you\u2019re in a position to provide leadership to make those forces of change work for us and not against us. The vice president has a long resume. But it didn\u2019t stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah. And we now know that he was not out of the loop; he was in meeting after meeting listening to Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger opposing that, and yet he supported it. His experience didn\u2019t prevent him from participating or involving or in some way being involved in the relationship between this government and Mr. Noriega and drug trafficking in Panama. He went to Philippines in the early 80\u00cf\u20acs and commended Ferdinand Macros for his commitment to democracy. And he continues to support a failed policy in Central America which is getting worse and worse, and which has in fact increased Cuban and Soviet influence in that region. So I don\u2019t believe that the fact you\u2019ve got that long resume or had that experience is the real question. The question is values; the question is strength, the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provided. I\u2019m ready to provide that leadership. I want to be the commander in chief of this country. I think it take fresh leadership now, and an understanding of those forces of change to provide the kind of strength that we need, and perhaps the vice president can explain what he was doing when he supported the trading of arms to terrorist nation, and his involvement in Panama and that endorsement of Mr. Macros. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just experience that makes the difference. It\u2019s strength; it\u2019s values."}

As a matter of fact, he said it was not and should not be subject to partisan demagoguery because it was too important for the United States or for the world. I didn\u2019t hear, John, exactly where he was going to cut and what he was going to do. But I know this, we have serious financial problems in this country. We\u2019ve piled up over a trillion dollars in debt and the next president of the United States is going to have to make some choices. Mr. Bush wants to spend billions on Star Wars. He apparently wants to spend billions on the MX on railroad cars, a weapons system we don\u2019t need and can\u2019t afford. I thought the administration was opposed to the Midgetman. I thought the administration was at the negotiating table in Geneva suggesting that we ban mobile missile systems entirely.

And at the same time a willingness to move forward steadily, thoughtfully cautiously. We have serious differences with the Soviet Union. We have very fundamental differences about human rights, democracy and our basic system, our basic view of human beings and of what life is all about. But there are opportunities there now. Senator Bentsen and I have a plan for the 1990\u00cf\u20acs and beyond. Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle do not. And we want to pursue that plan in a way which will bring down the level of nuclear armament, will build a more stable and more peaceful world while making choices here at home.

I said from the beginning that we ought to continue research into the strategic system at about the level that was added in 1983, that\u2019s about a billion dollars a year. But I don\u2019t know of any reputable scientist who believed that this system, at least as originally conceived could possibly work, this notion of some kind of astrodome over ourselves that could protect us from enemy attack. It makes real sense. And as a matter of fact, the system that the administration is now talking about is very different from the one that was originally proposed in 1983. So, I\u2019m for continued research, but I also want strong conventional forces. Now, the other day, Mr. Bush said, \u00e2\u2030\u00a5Well, if we continue with Star War-Star Wars-we have to cut some place.\u00e2\u2030\u00a4 He hasn\u2019t told us where. We know where they\u2019re cutting. We know where you\u2019re cutting right now. You\u2019re cutting into the fiber and muscle of our conventional forces. You\u2019re cutting back on maintenance and equipment. An Air Force General not too long ago in Europe who said that pretty soon we\u2019d have airplanes without engines, tank commanders who can\u2019t drive their tanks more than three-quarters of a mile, because they don\u2019t have enough fuel. Coast Guard cutters tied up at the dock this summer, not patrolling. They\u2019re supposed to be our first line of defense against drugs and the war against drugs, because they don\u2019t have enough fuel. You have to make choices. We\u2019re not making those choices. And to spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr. Bush apparently wants to, although, he, himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately-on Star Wars-in my judgment makes no sense at all. We need a strong, credible, effective nuclear deterrent. We have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads right now on land, on sea and in the air, enough to blow up the Soviet Union forty times over. They have about 12,000. So, we\u2019ve got to move forward with those negotiations, get the level of strategic weapons down. But to continue to commit billions to this system makes no sense at all and I think Mr. Bush has been reconsidering his position over the course of the past few weeks. That\u2019s-at least that\u2019s what I read. Maybe he\u2019ll tell us where he stand on it tonight."}

But if there\u2019s one thing we also understand it is that you cannot make concessions to terrorists, ever, ever. Because if you do, it\u2019s an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us. And that\u2019s the tragedy of the Iran\/Contra scandal. As a matter of fact, Mr. Bush was the Chairman of a task force on international terrorism which issued a report shortly before that decision was made and said, and rightly so, that we never ever can make concessions to terrorists and hostage takers. And, yet, after sitting through meeting after meeting, he endorsed that decision, endorsed the sale of arms to the Ayatollah in exchange for hostages, one of the most tragic, one of the most mistaken foreign policy decisions we\u2019ve ever made in this country and I dare say encouraged others to take hostages as we now know. So, there can be no concessions under any circumstances, because if we do it\u2019s an open invitation to others to do the same. We\u2019ve got to be tough on international terrorism. We\u2019ve got to treat it as international crime. We\u2019ve got to attack at all points, we\u2019ve go to use undercover operations. We have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camps, we have to work closely with our allies to make sure that they\u2019re working with us and we with them and we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of international terrorism. Yes, we should make every effort to try to help those hostages come home, but it can never be because we make concessions. That was a tragic mistake that we made, a mistake that Mr. Bush made and others made and it should never ever be made again."}

And at the same time will destroy markets that are important to our farmers. But I also believe we need an agricultural policy which doesn\u2019t cost us 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars a year that it\u2019s been costing us over the course of the past three or four years under this administration. I think it\u2019s going to require good, solid credit policies. And thanks to the Congress we now have an agricultural credit bill which is helping and improving the situation with at least some of our farmers. I think it\u2019s going to require a combination of supply management and reasonable price supports to make sure that our farmers get a decent price and I think it also is going to require an administration that understand that there are tremendous opportunities out there for the development of new uses for agricultural products, new uses which can help us to clean up our environment at the same time. Bio-degradable plastics-plastic-gasohol, which the Vice President has been involved in, road de-icers made from corn products. I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future for rural communities and for rural America and at the same time working on Third World debt. As a matter of fact, Mexico, itself, is one of our biggest agricultural customers, so in the sense that we can work to help Mexico rebuild and expand and deal with these very serious economic problems we help our farmers at the same time."}

They made sure their sons understood that this was the greatest country in the world, that those of us especially who were the sons and daughters of immigrants had a special responsibility to give something to the country that had opened up its arms to our parents and given so much to them.

Qualifications for the office of Vice President or President are not age alone. You must look at accomplishments, and you must look at experience. I have more experience than others that have sought the office of Vice President. Now let\u2019s look at qualifications, and let\u2019s look at the three biggest issues that are going to be confronting America in the next presidency. Those three issues are national security and arms control; jobs and education; and the Federal budget deficit. On each one of those issues I have more experience than does the Governor of Massachusetts. In national security and arms control, you have to understand the difference between a ballistic missile, a warhead, what throwweight, what megatonnage is. You better understand about telemetry and encryption. And you better understand that you have to negotiate from a position of strength. These are important issues, because we want to have more arms control and arms reductions. In the area of jobs and education, I wrote the Job Training Partnership Act, a bipartisan bill, a bill that has trained and employed over three million economically disadvantaged youth and adults in this country. On the area of the Federal budget deficit, I have worked eight years on the Senate Budget Committee. And I wish that the Congress would give us the line item veto to help deal with that.

We agree on the fact that we have to cut this deficit. And Gov. Dukakis has been able to cut that deficit ten budgets in a row in the State of Massachusetts, while he lowered the tax burden on their people from one of the highest to one of the lower in the United States. That is a major sense of achievement. And I admire that. And I\u2019m just delighted to be on the ticket with him. Gov. Dukakis and I agreed that we ought to have a trade policy for this country; that we\u2019ve seen this Administration more than double the national debt, that; they\u2019ve moved this country from the number one lender nation in the world to the number one debtor nation in the world under their Administration; that they have not had a trade policy; that they have let trade be a handmaiden for their foreign policy objectives of the country; that this country has exported too many jobs and not enough products. And as I worked to pass a trade bill through the United States Senate, they threw roadblocks in the way every step of the way. But we passed a trade bill that has this premise, that any country that has full access to our markets, we\u2019re entitled to full access to their markets. Now, that means that we\u2019re going to stand tough for America, and we\u2019re going to protect those jobs, and we\u2019re going to push American products, and we\u2019re going to open up markets around the world.

At that point they tried a $40-billion end run to cut Social Security. Now, the record is clear. And we saw Vice President Bush fly back from the west coast to break a tie in the United States Senate. He doesn\u2019t get to vote very often in the Senate, but he made a special trip to come back and vote against a cost-of-living increase. Now, when you talk about Social Security, the people that are going to protect it are the Democrats that brought forth that program. And I think it\u2019s very important that we not see these kinds of end runs by this administration.

Those are the positive things I think we could do to bring about peace in that area, to help raise that standard of living and give them the kind of stability where democracy can proceed and can prosper and bloom. Those are the kinds of things that we\u2019d be committed to in a Dukakis-Bentsen Administration to try to make this world a better place in which to live."}

The reason it is unfortunate, because it is beyond me why it\u2019s okay for the Soviet Union to put in billions of dollars to prop up the communist Sandinistas, but somehow it\u2019s wrong for the United States to give a few dollars to the democratic resistance. There\u2019s a thing called the Monroe Doctrine, something that the Governor of Massachusetts has said has been superseded. I doubt if many Americans agree with that. I think they believe in the Monroe Doctrine. Senator Bentsen talked about the entire Central America. There\u2019s another issue that Michael Dukakis is wrong on in Central America, and that\u2019s Grenada. He criticized our rescue mission in Grenada, according to a UPI report. Criticized that, yet 85 percent of the American people supported our rescue mission, and we turned a communist country into a noncommunist country. The Governor of Massachusetts is simply out of step with mainstream America."}

And what I\u2019ve done in PAC money is just what my opponent in my campaign has done in his campaign. He has been raising PAC money, too. So what you have to do is comply with the laws as they are, whether you\u2019re paying taxes or you\u2019re playing a football game. Whether you like those laws or not, you comply with them. Now, I have been for campaign reform, and have pushed it very hard. I believe that we have to do some things in that regard. But I\u2019ve noticed that the Senator from Indiana has opposed that campaign reform and voted repeatedly against it. The things we have to do, I believe, that will cut back on soft money, for example, which I look on as frankly one of those things that we\u2019ve had to do because the Republicans have done it for so long. But I think it\u2019s a loophole, frankly. But campaign reform, changing the rules of the game, is something we tried repeatedly in this session of the Congress, but only to have the Republicans lead the charge against us and defeat us. And I wish that Senator Quayle would change his mind on that particular piece of legislation and give us the kind of a campaign reform law that I think is needed in America."}

I have been in the Congress and I\u2019ve worked on these issues. And believe me, when you look at arms control and trying to deal with the Soviet Union, you cannot come at it from a naive position. You have to understand the Soviet Union. You have to understand how they will respond.

And I disagree with that. And I\u2019ll tell you why. If you want to ask some business people that I talk to periodically, they complain about the tough enforcement of this administration and, furthermore, let me tell you this for the record, when we have found violations in this administration, there has not only been tough enforcement, but there have been the most severe penalties \u2013 the largest penalties in the history of the Department of Labor \u2013 have been levied when these violations have been found. There is a commitment and there will always be a commitment to the safety of our working men and women. They deserve it and we\u2019re committed to them. Now, the broader question goes to the whole issue of deregulation and has deregulation worked or has deregulation not worked. In my judgment deregulation has worked. We have a deregulated economy and we have produced through low taxes, not high taxes, through deregulation \u2013 the spirit of entrepreneurship, the individual going out and starting a business, the businessman or women willing to go out and risk their investments to start up a business and hire people. We have produced 17 million jobs in this country since 1982. Deregulation as a form of political philosophy is a good philosophy. It\u2019s one that our opponents disagree with. They want a centralized government. But we believe in the market, we believe in the people and yes, there\u2019s a role of government and the role of government is to make sure that those safety \u2013 and health and the welfare of the people is taken care of.

Now, I feel very strongly that we ought to be doing more for the American farmer and what we\u2019ve seen under this administration is neglect of that farmer. We\u2019ve seen them drive 220,000 farmers off the farm. They seem to think the answer is move them to town, but we ought not to be doing that. What you have seen them do is cut the farm assistance for the rural areas by over 50 percent. We\u2019re seeing rural hospitals close all over the country because of this kind of an administration. We\u2019ve seen an administration that has lost much of our market abroad, because they have not had a trade policy. We saw our market loss by some 40 percent. And that\u2019s one of the reasons that we\u2019ve seen the cost of the farm program, which was only about two and a half billion dollars when they took office, now go to about $25 billion. Now, we can bring that kind of a cost down and get more to market prices if we\u2019ll have a good trade policy. I was in January visiting with Mr. Takeshita, the new Prime Minister of Japan. I said, \u201cYou\u2019re paying five times as much for beef as we pay for our in country \u2013 pay for it in our country, six times as much for rice. You have a $60 billion trade surplus with us.

Every one percent in increase in interest rates, a billion dollars out of the farmer\u2019s pocket. Net farm income, increased inflation, another billion dollars. Another thing that a farmer is not interested in and that\u2019s supply management that the Democratic platform talks about. But the Governor of Massachusetts, he has a farm program. He went to the farmers in the Midwest and told them not to grow corn, not to grow soybeans, but to grow Belgium  endive.

They have taken this country from the No. 1 lender nation in the world to the No. 1 debtor nation in the world. And the interest on that debt next year, on this Reagan-Bush debt of our nation, is going to be $640 for every man, woman, and child in America because of this kind of a credit-card mentality. So we go out and we try to sell our securities every week, and hope that the foreigners will buy them. And they do buy them. But every time they do, we lose some of our economic independence for the future. Now they\u2019ve turned around and they\u2019ve bought 10 percent of the manufacturing base of this country. They bought 20 percent of the banks. They own 46 percent of the commercial real estate in Los Angeles. They are buying America on the cheap. Now, when we have other countries that can\u2019t manage their economy down in Central and South America, we send down the American ambassador, we send down the International Monetary Fund, and we tell them what they can buy and what they can sell and how to run their economies. The ultimate irony would be to have that happen to us, because foreigners finally quit buying our securities. So what we need in this country is someone like Mike Dukakis, who gave ten balanced budgets in a row there, and was able to do that, meet that kind of a commitment, set those tough priorities. We need an administration that will turn this trade policy around and open up those markets, stand tough with our trading partners to help keep the jobs at home and send the products abroad."}

But what we also should do is get them to give us more burden sharing when it comes to national defense. We have a situation today where, on a per capita basis, people in Western Europe are spending about one-third as much as we are in our country. And then when you go to Japan, where we\u2019re spending 6-1\/2 percent on defense of the democracies, they\u2019re spending one percent. I met with some of the Japanese business leaders, talking to them about it. And I said, you know, we have 50,000 troops here in Japan, protecting the democracies of Asia. And it costs $3.5 billion a year. You\u2019re the number two economic power in the world. You ought to measure up to that responsibility and carry some of that cost. I said, if we were not doing what we\u2019re doing, we\u2019d have a big budget surplus. And I said, you\u2019d have chaos, because you get 55 percent of your oil from the Persian Gulf, and you wouldn\u2019t have the U.S. Navy down there to take care of that. Now, the Senator from Indiana, when we passed a resolution in the United States Senate to ask for burden sharing on that cost to keep those sea lanes open from the Japanese, he votes against that.

When you try to do that there is no question but what you just encourage more taking of hostages. And that\u2019s been the result by this dumb idea that was cooked up in the White House basement. And I want to tell you that George Bush, attending seventeen of those meetings, and having no record of what he said \u2013 if Lloyd Bentsen was in those meetings, you would certainly hear from him and no one would be asking: Where is Lloyd? (Shouts and applause) Because I would be saying: That\u2019s a dumb idea, and now let\u2019s put an end to it. And I would speak up on that type of thing.

I wonder if you think it\u2019s really fair for you to advance that view in light of the fact that you ran for the presidency, not the vice-presidency, in 1976 having not yet completed one full term in the Senate and having previously served three terms in the House almost a quarter of a century earlier, when in fact your time in Washington was about equal to what he has now. Well, I think what you have to look at is the record of a man who has served his country \u2013 (Shouts, laughter) \u2013 served his country in war, headed up a squadron in combat, a man who built a business, knew what it was to meet a payroll and create jobs, and then serve in the United States Senate; and one who has been able to bring about some of the kinds of legislation that I\u2019ve been able to bring about in my service there. I must say I didn\u2019t do a very good job of running for the presidency, and I\u2019m well aware of that. But what we are looking at today is trying to judge once again the breadth of experience and the maturity of someone taking on this kind of a task. That is the judgment that has to be exercised by the people of America. It\u2019s a presidential decision that you are facing, and a very important one, because we are talking about who is going to lead this country into its future. And you can\u2019t have a more important responsibility than that one."}

We have 51 percent of that private industry council that are businessmen and women; we have members of unions; we have community-based organizations; we have education leaders.

The three books are, one, Richard Nixon\u2019s Victory in 1999, Richard Lugar\u2019s \u2013 Senator Richard Lugar\u2019s \u2013 Letters to the Next President, Bob Massey\u2019s Nicholas and Alexandra, which deals with the fall of the Russian empire and the coming of Leninism in 1917. Those three books, which I read over the last spring vacation and early summer, had a very definite impact, because what former President Nixon and Senator Richard Lugar were talking about was a foreign policy as we move toward the 21st century. And the historical book of the downfall of the czar and the coming of Leninism, combining those three books together, gave me a better appreciation of the challenges that we have ahead of us. In Senator Lugar\u2019s book, he talks about the advancement of human rights around the world; he talked about his leadership effort in the Philippines and South Africa, where we now see human rights advancement on the Reagan agenda. Former President Nixon talked about what we are going to do after detente and arms control, and how we are going to pursue new arms control with the Soviet Union; he talked a little bit about how we deal with the Soviet Union \u2013 and this is one of the differences between George Bush and Michael Dukakis, because George Bush understands that to deal with the Soviet Union and to get progress you must deal from a position of strength. And the governor of Massachusetts doesn\u2019t understand that. I understand it. And a George Bush administration will pursue that policy."}

And it seems to me that the Senator from Indiana is beginning to do that one. As I look toward our progress that\u2019s been made toward disarmament and cutting back on nuclear weapons and see what Ronald Reagan has been able to do with the INF treaty \u2013 and I think he deserves great credit with that one. I see a situation where the Senator from Indiana has now jumped off the reservation, when we talk about building on what Ronald Reagan has done and opposes what Ronald Reagan wants to do, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense and says let\u2019s go slow on further disarmament in trying to get the next treaty. I think that\u2019s a mistake. I think that you have to deal with the Russians from strength and we have to understand that you have to have a strong modernized nuclear deterrent, but I think we can make substantial progress and we ought to take advantage. I think he\u2019s arrived at a very dangerous judgment in the question of war and peace and it concerns me very much. Because I saw him also try to sabotage the INF treaty when it was on the Floor of the United States Senate with what he was doing there. He\u2019s listening once again to the winds of the radical right."}

And I have. And let\u2019s go to the \u2013 right to the very first question \u2013 the Job Training Partnership Act. I was the author of that. The co-author in the United States Senate was Senator Kennedy. I was the Chairman of the Employment and Productivity Subcommittee. Chairmen of the committee write that legislation. Chairmen of the committee write the legislation and then they go out and get co-sponsorship. And when you are the chairman of the committee and you sit down and you write the legislation, you are the author of that. And I\u2019m proud to have been the author of that. Because you know what we had, we had a CETA program that spent $50 billion from about 1973 through 1982 and when we concluded that program \u2013 when we concluded that program, unemployment was higher than when it began. It was a program that didn\u2019t work and the Job Training Partnership Act does work.

And the way I would accomplish that\u2013was with a tough trade policy, opening up those markets, getting those prices back up to market prices. We can do that if we have an aggressive trade policy for our country, if we make trade a number one priority and not trade it off for some foreign policy objective at the moment. That means we have to stand up for the American farmers and that cuts back on the regulation on American farmers. That\u2019s a positive way to accomplish that. In addition to that, we do some of the things that I think have to be done insofar as doing a better job of procurement, particularly when we\u2019re talking about some of our military things that we should buy. I know that I fought very hard to put in an independent inspector general for the Defense Department, that the Senator from Indiana opposed me on that. But we were finally able to put that into effect and we saved over a quarter of a billion dollars this year, almost enough to buy a squadron of 716s. Those are the kids of things that I\u2019d work on. One of the things I learned in business is that you can expect what you inspect. So, we\u2019d be a \u2013 doing a much tougher job of auditing, to try to get rid of some of these kickbacks to consultants on military contracts, to be much more aggressive on that. In addition, those types of things would bring the interest rate down. I\u2019d try to turn this trade deficit around and that too would help us and help us very substantially. And I\u2019d get rid of some things like these planes that \u2013 are going to have \u2013 that the administration wants that\u2019ll fly from New York to Tokyo and take those investment bankers over there in four hours.

Senator Bentsen voted against Gramm-Rudman, the very tool that has been used to bring the Federal budget deficit down. We\u2019re going to need all the tools possible to bring this Federal budget deficit down. We need the tools of a line item veto. A line item veto that 43 governors in this country have, but not the President of the United States. The President of the United States needs to have a line item veto.

I\u2019ve seen many chief executives come into my office and say they\u2019re going over and tell the president of the United States off, they\u2019re going to pound the desk, and go into that office and turn to Jello. Now, I\u2019ve dealt with many a president, and I don\u2019t hesitate for a minute to speak up. But when you\u2019re talking about something like the death penalty, where Michael Dukakis and I do disagree, what you really ought to get to is what\u2019s being done against crime, and what kind of progress he\u2019s been able to make. In the state of Massachusetts he has the homicide rate down to the lowest of any industrial state. It\u2019s substantially ahead of the national average. He\u2019s been able to do that with an educated program for the people of that state by adding some 1,500 new police officers; he\u2019s done it in turn by the leadership that I think he will bring to the ticket when he becomes president of the United States and fighting drugs. He\u2019s taken it down some four percent in the high schools of that state, while it\u2019s gone up about the rest of the nation. But you would seem him as president of the United States being very aggressive in this fight against crime, and having that kind of a successful result. And that\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m delighted and proud to be on the ticket with him. Sure, we have some differences, but overall we have so many things we agree on.

And I think you know that I\u2019ve opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I don\u2019t see any evidence that it\u2019s a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime. We\u2019ve done so in my own state. And it\u2019s one of the reasons why we have had the biggest drop in crime of any industrial state in America; why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in America. But we have work to do in this nation. We have work to do to fight a real war, not a phony war, against drugs. And that\u2019s something I want to lead, something we haven\u2019t had over the course of the past many years, even though the Vice President has been at least allegedly in charge of that war. We have much to do to step up that war, to double the number of drug enforcement agents, to fight both here and abroad, to work with our neighbors in this hemisphere. And I want to call a hemispheric summit just as soon after the 20th of January as possible to fight that war. But we also have to deal with drug education prevention here at home. And that\u2019s one of the things that I hope I can lead personally as the President of the United States. We\u2019ve had great success in my own state. And we\u2019ve reached out to young people and their families and been able to help them by beginning drug education and prevention in the early elementary grades. So we can fight this war, and we can win this war. And we can do so in a way that marshals our forces, that provides real support for state and local law enforcement officers who have not been getting that support, and do it in a way which will bring down violence in this nation, will help our youngsters to stay away from drugs, will stop this avalanche of drugs that\u2019s pouring into the country, and will make it possible for our kids and our families to grow up in safe and secure and decent neighborhoods."}

You see, I do believe that some crimes are so heinous, so brutal, so outrageous, and I\u2019d say particularly those that result in the death of a police officer, for those real brutal crimes, I do believe in the death penalty, and I think it is a deterrent, and I believe we need it. And I\u2019m glad that the Congress moved on this drug bill and have finally called for that related to these narcotics drug kingpins.

(Applause) But you know, Lloyd Bentsen jumped on Dan Quayle, when Dan Quayle said, he\u2019s had roughly the same amount of experience. He had two terms in the Congress. He had two terms in the Senate, serving his second term. He founded authored, the job training partnership act. It says to American working men and women that are thrown out of work for no fault of their own that they\u2019re going to have jobs. We\u2019re moving into a new competitive age, and we need that kind of thing. He, unlike my opponent, is an expert in national defense; helped amend the INF treaty so we got a good, sound treaty, when these people over here were talking about a freeze. If we\u2019d listened to them, we would never have had a treaty. And so I have great confidence in him. And it\u2019s turning around. You know, the American people are fair. They don\u2019t like it when there\u2019s an unfair pounding and kind of hooting about people. They want to judge it on the record itself. And so I\u2019m proud of my choice. And you know, I don\u2019t think age is the only criterion. But I\u2019ll tell you something, I\u2019m proud that people who are 30 years old and 40 years old now have someone in their generation that is going to be vice president of the United States of America.

I don\u2019t want to kill it off by a tax increase. More Americans at work today than at any time in the history of the country, and a greater percentage of the work force. And the way you kill expansions is to raise taxes. And I don\u2019t want to do that, and I won\u2019t do that. And what I have proposed is something much better. And it\u2019s going to take discipline of the executive branch; it\u2019s going to take discipline of the congressional branch. And that is what I call a flexible freeze that allows growth about 4 percent or the rate of inflation but does not permit the Congress just to add on spending. I hear this talk about a blank check. The American people are pretty smart: they know who writes out the checks. And they know who appropriates the money. It is the United States Congress. And by two to one, Congress is blamed for these deficits. And the answer is to discipline both the executive branch and the congressional branch by holding the line on taxes. So I\u2019m pledged to do that. And those pessimists who say it can\u2019t be done, I\u2019m sorry, I just have a fundamental disagreement with them"}

He\u2019s broken it three times in the past year already. So it isn\u2019t worth the paper it\u2019s printed on. And what I\u2019m concerned about is that if we continue with the policies that Mr. Bush is talking about here this evening, the flexible freeze somebody described it the other day as a kind of economic slurpee he wants to spend billions on virtually every weapons system around. He says he\u2019s not going to raise taxes, though he has broken that pledge repeatedly. He says he wants to give the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country a five-year $40 billion tax break, and we\u2019re going to pay for it. And he\u2019s been proposing all kinds of programs for new spending costing billions. Now if we continue with these policies, this trillion and a half dollars worth of new debt that\u2019s already been added on the backs of the American taxpayer is going to increase even more, and if we continue with this for another four years, then I\u2019m worried about the next generation, whether we can ever turn this situation around.

There is no way of anticipating what may happen. I will say this: that we will set as our goal a steady, gradual reduction of the deficit, which will require tough choices on spending; it will require a good strong rate of economic growth; it will require a plan that the president works out with the Congress doesn\u2019t blame them, works it out with them, which brings that deficit down; it will require us to go out and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren\u2019t being paid in this country. And that\u2019s grossly unfair to the average American who is paying his taxes and paying them on time and doesn\u2019t have any alternative: it\u2019s taken out of his paycheck. Mr. Bush says we are going to put the IRS on every taxpayer. That\u2019s not what we are going to do. I\u2019m for the taxpayer bill of rights. But I think it\u2019s unconscionable, Ann, that we should be talking or thinking about imposing new taxes on average Americans when there are billions out there, over $100 billion, in taxes owed that aren\u2019t being paid. Now, I think if we work together on it, and if you have a president that will work with the Congress and the American people, we can bring that deficit down steadily, $20, $25, $30 billion a year, build economic growth, build a good strong future for America, invest in those things which we must invest in economic development, good jobs, good schools for our kids, college opportunity for young people, decent health care and affordable housing, and a clean and safe environment. We can do all of those things, and at the same time build a future in which we are standing on a good strong fiscal foundation. Senator Bentsen said, as you recall at the debate with Senator Quayle, that if you give any of us $200 billion worth of hot checks a year, we can create an illusion of prosperity. But sooner or later that credit card mentality isn\u2019t going to work. And I want to bring to the White House a sense of strength and fiscal responsibility which will build a good strong foundation under which this country, or above which country can move, grow, invest, and build the best America for its people and for our kids and our grandkids."}

So I hope and expect that I will be liked by the people of this country as president of the United States; I certainly hope I will be liked by them on the 8th of November. (Laughter) But I also think it\u2019s important to be somebody who is willing to make those tough choices. Now, we have just heard two or three times from the vice president: he\u2019s not going to raise taxes. I repeat, within days after you made that pledge, you broke it; you said, well, maybe as a last resort we\u2019ll do it. And you supported legislation this year that\u2019s involved tax increases not once, but twice. So that pledge isn\u2019t realistic, and I think the vice president knows it; I think the people of this country know it. The fact of the matter is that the next president of the United States is going to have to go to the White House seriously, he is going to have to work with the Congress seriously he can\u2019t turn to the Congress and blame them for the fact that we don\u2019t have a balanced budget and that we have billions and billions of dollars in red ink. And I am going to be a president who is serious, I hope and expect will be liked by the American people. But more than that, to do the kind of job that I\u2019m elected to do, will do it with as much good humor as I can, but at the same time will do it in a way which will achieve the goals we want for ourselves and our people.

And the reason I\u2019ve had to do that is that he ran on the left in the Democratic primary, ran firmly and ran with conviction and ran on his record.

And this is something Republicans have used for a long time. They tried it with Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and John Kennedy. It\u2019s not labels. It\u2019s our vision of America.

The Vice President is complacent, thinks we ought to stick with the status quo, doesn\u2019t think we ought to move ahead, thinking things are okay as they are. I don\u2019t.

I think we can save money through this whole very sophisticated concept, Andrea, that I know you do understand of competitive strategies. It is new and it is very very different than what\u2019s happened, but it\u2019s not quite ready to be totally implemented. But it\u2019s very important. I think we can say, through the Packard Commission Report and I\u2019m very proud that David Packard, the originator of that report, is strongly supporting me. So, it\u2019s not a question of saying our budget is full of a lot of waste. I don\u2019t believe that. I do think this. We\u2019re in the serious stages of negotiation with the Soviet Union on the strategic arms control talks. And we\u2019re protecting a couple of options in terms of modernizing our strategic forces. My Secretary of Defense is going to have to make a very difficult decision in which system to go forward with. But we are protecting both of them. We are moving forward with negotiations and, you see, I just think it would be dumb negotiating policy with the Soviets to cut out one or the other of the two options right now. The Soviets are modernizing. They continue to modernize and we can\u2019t simply we\u2019ve got enough nuclear weapons, let\u2019s freeze. We can\u2019t do that. We have to have modernization, especially if we achieve the 50 percent reduction in strategic weapons that our President is taking the leadership to attain. And, so, that\u2019s the way I\u2019d reply to it and I believe we can have the strongest and best defense possible if we modernize, if we go forward with competitive strategies and if we do follow through on the Packard Commission report."}

We are not going to spend the billions and trillions that Mr. Bush wants to spend on Star Wars. We\u2019re not going to spend billions on MX\u2019s on railroad cars, which is a weapons system we don\u2019t need, can\u2019t afford and won\u2019t help our defense posture at all.

That\u2019s an incredibly powerful nuclear deterrent. I don\u2019t rule out modernization, and there are discussions going on now in the Congress, I know with the Pentagon, about a less expensive modernized land-based leg of the triad. But there are limits to what we can spend. There are limits to this nation\u2019s ability to finance these weapons systems. And one of the things that the Vice President either ignores or won\u2019t address is the fact that you can\u2019t divorce our military security from our economic security. How can we build a strong America militarily that\u2019s teeter-tottering on a mountain of debt? And if we go forward with the kinds of policies that the Vice President is suggesting tonight and has in the past, that debt is going to grow bigger and bigger and bigger. So military security and economic security go hand in hand. And we will have a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent. We\u2019re going to have conventional forces that are well maintained, well equipped, well trained, well supported. And we have serious problems with our conventional forces at the present time, and they\u2019ll get worse unless we have a president who is willing to make some of these decisions. And we also have important domestic priorities, in education and housing and health care, in economic development, in job training, in the environment. And all of these things are going to have to be addressed. That\u2019s why I say again to all of you out there who have to deal with your household budgets and know how difficult it is that the next President has to do the same. I want the men and women of our Armed Forces to have the support they need to defend us; the support they need when they risk our lives to keep us free and to keep this country free. But we cannot continue to live on a credit card. We cannot continue to tell the American people that we\u2019re going to build all of these systems, and at the same time, invest in important things here at home, and be serious about building a strong and good America. And that\u2019s the kind of America I want to build."}

He talked about a nuclear freeze back at the time when I was in Europe trying to convince European public opinion that we ought to go forward with the deployment of the INF weapons. And thank God, the freeze people were not heard. They were wrong. And the result is, we deployed, and the Soviets kept deploying, and then we negotiated from strength. And now we have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age to ban weapons. You just don\u2019t make unilateral cuts in the naive hope that the Soviets are going to behave themselves.

I think of those young athletes who represented us at the Olympics were tremendously impressive. We were proud of them. We felt strongly about them, and they did so well by us. I can think of doctors and scientists, Jonas Salk who for example discovered a vaccine which cured one of the most dread diseases we ever had. And he\u2019s a hero. I think of classroom teachers, classroom teachers that I have had, classroom teachers that youngsters have today who are real heroes to our young people. Because they inspire them. They teach them. But more than that, they are role models. Members of the clergy who have done the same. Drug counselors out there in the street who are providing help to youngsters who come up to me and others who ask for help and want help, are doing the hard work, the heroic work, which it takes to provide that kind of leadership, that kind of counseling, that kind of support. I think of people in the law enforcement community who are taking their lives in their hands everyday, when they go up to one of those doors and kick it down and try to stop this flow of drugs into our communities and into our kids. So there are many, many heroes in this country today. These are people that give of themselves everyday and every week and every month. In many cases they are people in the community who are examples, and are role models. And I would hope that one of the things I could do as president is to recognize them, to give them the kind of recognition that they need and deserve so that more and more young people can themselves become the heroes of tomorrow, can go into public service, can go into teaching, can go into drug counseling, can go into law enforcement, and be heroes themselves to generations yet to come."}

I think of a young man now in this country named Villadaris, who was released from a Cuban jail. Came out and told the truth in this brilliant book, Against All Hope, about what is actually happening in Cuba. I think of those people that took us back into space again, Rick Houk and that crew, as people that are worthy of this. I agree with the Governor on athletics. And there\u2019s nothing corny about having sports heroes, young people that are clean and honorable and out there setting the pace. I think of Dr. Fauci. Probably never heard of him. You did, Ann heard of him. He\u2019s a very fine research, top doctor, at the National Institute of Health, working hard doing something about research on this disease of AIDS. But look, I also think we ought to give a little credit to the President of the United States. He is the one who has gotten us that first arms control agreement."}

And Barbara and I were sitting there before that Democratic convention. And we saw the Governor and his son on television the night before and his family, and his mother who was there. And I\u2019m saying to Barbara, you know, we\u2019ve always kept family as a bit of an oasis for us. You all know me, and we\u2019ve held it back a little. But we used that as a role model, the way he took understandable pride in his heritage, what his family means to him. And we\u2019ve got a strong family. And we watched that. And we said, hey, we\u2019ve got to unleash the Bush kids. And so you saw ten grandchildren there jumping all over their grandfather at the convention. You see our five kids, all over this country, and their spouses. And so I would say that the concept of the Dukakis family has my great respect. And I would say, I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s kind or not, it\u2019s just an objective statement. I think the man anybody that gets into this political arena and has to face you guys everyday deserves a word of praise. Because it\u2019s gotten a little ugly out there. It\u2019s gotten a little nasty. It\u2019s not much fun sometimes. And I would cite again Dan Quayle. I\u2019ve been in politics a long time, and I don\u2019t remember that kind of piling on, that kind of ugly rumor that never was true, printed. Now, come on. So some of it is unfair. But he\u2019s in the arena. Teddy Roosevelt used to talk about the arena, you know, daring to fail greatly or succeed, no matter. He\u2019s in there. So I salute these things. I salute those who participate in the political process. Sam Raybum had a great expression on this. He said here were all these intellectuals out there griping and complaining and saying it was negative coverage. Rayburn says, yeah, and that guy never ran for sheriff either. Michael Dukakis has run for sheriff, and so has George Bush."}

Let me answer your question and I hope it doesn\u2019t get too personal or maudlin. Barb and I lost a child, you know that we lost a daughter, Robin. I was over running records in west Texas, and I got a call from her, come home; went to the doctor; the doctor said, beautiful child, your child has a few weeks to live. And I said, what can we do about it. He said, no, she has leukemia, acute leukemia, a few weeks to live. We took the child to New York. Thanks to the miraculous sacrifice of doctors and nurses, the child stayed alive for six months and then died. If that child were here today, and I was told the same thing, my granddaughter, Noel for example that child could stay alive for ten or fifteen years, or maybe for the rest of her life. And so I don\u2019t think that you make an exception based on medical knowledge at the time. I think human life is very, very precious. And, look, this hasn\u2019t been an easy decision for me to meet. I know others disagree with it. But when I was in that little church across the river from Washington and saw our grandchild christened in our faith, I was very pleased indeed that the mother had not aborted that child, and put the child up for adoption. And so I just feel this is where I\u2019m coming from. And it is personal. And I don\u2019t assail him on that issue, or others on that issue. But that\u2019s the way I, George Bush, feel about it.

That\u2019s a decision that only a woman can make, after consulting her conscience and consulting her religious principles.

No, I don\u2019t happen to share that goal. It\u2019s an example of how oftentimes we may be associated with organizations all of whose particular positions we don\u2019t support, even though we support in general the hope that over time, particularly if we can get those reductions in strategic weapons, if we can get a comprehensive test ban treaty, if we can negotiate with the Soviet Union and bring down the level of conventional forces in Europe with deeper cuts in the Soviet side, yes, at some point it may be possible to reduce defense outlays and use those for important things here at home, like jobs and job training and college opportunity and health and housing and the environment and the things that all of us care about. But I do think this, that the next president, even within a relatively stable budget and that\u2019s what we are going to have for the foreseeable future will have to make those tough choices that I was talking about and that Mr. Bush doesn\u2019t seem to want to make. And that really is going to be a challenge for the next president of the United States; I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question about it. But I also see a tremendous opportunity now to negotiate with the Soviet Union to build on the progress that we\u2019ve made with the INF Treaty, which I strongly supported and most Democrats did to get those reductions in strategic weapons, to get a test ban treaty, and to really make progress on the reduction of conventional forces in Europe. And if we can do that and do it in a way that gets deeper cuts on the Soviet side, which is where they ought to come from, then I think we have an opportunity over the long haul to begin to move some of our resources from the military to important domestic priorities that can provide college opportunity for that young woman whose mother wrote me from Texas just the other day, from Longview, Texas: two teachers, a mother and a father who have a child that\u2019s a freshman in college, an electrical engineering major, a very bright student and they can\u2019t afford to keep that child in college. So I hope that we can begin to move those resources. It\u2019s not going to happen overnight; it certainly will have to happen on a step-by-step basis as we make progress in arms negotiation and arms control and arms reduction. But it certainly ought to be the long-term goal of all Americans and I think it is."}

See, I don\u2019t believe any other country can pick up the mantel. I served at the UN. I don\u2019t think we can turn over these kinds of decisions of the collective defense to the United Nations or anything else. So, what I\u2019m saying is, we are going to have to make choices. I said I would have the Secretary of Defense sit down. But while the President is negotiating with the Soviet Union, I simply do not want to make these unilateral cuts. And I think those that advocated the freeze missed the point that there was a better way and that better way has resulted in a principle asymmetrical cuts.

We don\u2019t have an alternative. We\u2019ll lose it when it\u2019s taken out of our paycheck before we even get it. But it\u2019s the Internal Revenue Service which estimates now that we aren\u2019t collecting $100 billion or more in taxes owed in this country. And that is just absolutely unfair to the vast majority of Americans who pay their taxes and pay them on time. The Dorgan Task Force, which included two internal revenue commissioners, one a Republican, one a Democrat. It was a bipartisan commission, a study by two respected economists, which indicated that we could collect some 40, 45, 50 billion dollars of those funds. The point is you\u2019ve got to have a president who\u2019s prepared to do this and to begin right away and, preferably, a president who was a governor of a state that\u2019s had very, very successful experience at doing this. In my own state, we did it. In other states, we\u2019ve done it. Republican governors as well as Democratic governors. And we\u2019ve had great success at revenue enforcement. Now, the Vice President will probably tell you that it\u2019s going to take an army of IRS collectors again. Well, his campaign manager, who used to be the secretary of the treasury, was taking great credit about a year ago and asking and receiving from the Congress substantial additional funds to hire internal revenue agents to go out and collect these funds, and I\u2019m happy to join Jim Baker in saying that we agree on this. But, the fact of the matter is that this is something that we must begin it\u2019s going to take at least the first year of the new administration.

It wasn\u2019t created as a welfare program. It wasn\u2019t created that is it was created as a whole retirement or supplement to retirement program. It wasn\u2019t created as a welfare program. So, here\u2019s what\u2019s happened. We came into office and the Social Security Trust Fund was in great jeopardy and the President took the leadership working with the Democrats and the Republicans in Congress some tough calls were made and the Social Security Trust Fund was put back into sound, solvent condition. So, I don\u2019t want to fool around with it. And there are several there\u2019s a good political reason because it\u2019s just about this time of year that the Democrats start saying the Republicans are going to take away your Social Security. It always works that way. I\u2019ve seen it. In precinct politics in Texas and I\u2019ve seen it at the national level. We have made the Social Security Trust Fund sound. And it is going to be operating at surpluses and I don\u2019t want the liberal Democratic Congress to spend out of that Social Security Trust Fund or go and take the money out for some other purpose. I don\u2019t want that. And I will not go in there and suggest changes in Social Security. I learned that the hard way and the Governor and I both supported slipping the COLAs for one year. He supported it at the National Governors Conference and I supported it in breaking a tie in a major compromise package and we got assailed by the Democrats in the election over that. And I am going to keep that Social Security Trust Fund sound and keep our commitment to the elderly and maybe down the line, maybe when you get two decades or one into the next century, you\u2019re going to have to take another look at it, but not now.

Now, two-thirds of the people in this country who receive Social Security checks live entirely on that check; they have no other income. And yet Mr. Bush tried to cut their cost of living increase in 1985. Medicare is not getting less expensive; medical care for the elderly is getting more expensive, with greater deductibles, with fewer benefits, the kinds of things we\u2019ve had under this Administration that have cut and chopped and reduced the kind of benefits that one gets under Medicare. Yes, we now have catastrophic health insurance, but it\u2019s going to cost, and that\u2019s going to be an additional burden on elderly citizens. It had bipartisan support; it should have had bipartisan support. But I suggest that we understand that those are going to be additional costs on senior citizens across this country. So I\u2019m not going to begin, and I\u2019m not going to go to entitlements as a means for cutting that deficit when we\u2019re spending billions on something like Star Wars, when we\u2019re spending billions on other weapon systems which apparently the Vice President wants to keep in his back pocket or some place, but which, if we continue to spend billions on them, will force us to cut Social Security, to cut Medicare, to cut these basic entitlements to people of very, very modest means. Now there are some things we can do to help people who currently do get entitlements to get off public assistance. I talked in our first debate about the possibilities of helping millions and millions of welfare families to get off of welfare, and I\u2019m proud to say that we finally have a welfare reform bill And the Ruby Samsons and Dan Lawsons, hundreds of thousands of welfare mothers in this country and in my state and across the country who today are working and earning are examples of what can happen when you provide training to those welfare mothers, some daycare for their children so that those mothers can go into a training program and get a decent job."}

And I never made that statement; never would. The point is that as we look at this nation\u2019s future, and we have two very different visions of this future. I want to move ahead.

But as we look at the decisions that the next president of the United States is going to have to make, I just don\u2019t believe the place you go first is those programs, those so-called entitlements, which provide a basic floor of income and a modest amount of medical care for the elderly, the disabled, for people who can\u2019t make their way on their own, and in many cases, have given a great deal to this country. The Vice President did call Social Security a few years ago basically or largely a welfare program. It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a contract between generations. It\u2019s something that we pay into now so that we will have a secure retirement, and our parents and grandparents will have a secure retirement. It\u2019s a very sacred contract, and I believe in it. So that\u2019s not where we ought to go. There are plenty of places to cut. There\u2019s lots we can do in the Pentagon where dishonest contractors have been lining their pockets at the expense of the American taxpayer. There are we certainly ought to be able to"}

And not one thing did I see, with respect, on your network about my views on agriculture, and not one did I read in any newspaper. Why? Because you are so interested in a poll that might have been coming out, or because somebody had said something nasty about somebody else. And so I don\u2019t know what the answer is. Somebody hit me and said Barry Goldwater said you ought to talk on issues more. How can Barry Goldwater sitting in Arizona know whether I\u2019m talking on the issues or not when we put out position paper after position paper, he puts out position paper after position paper; and we see this much about it, because everyone else is fascinated with polls and who\u2019s up or down today and who\u2019s going to be up or down tomorrow.

We want to work with them and build a new relationship, and they with us. But not a one of those key democratic leaders support our policy in Central America. And we\u2019ve got to work with them if we are going to create an environment for human rights and democracy for the people of this hemisphere, and go to work on our single most important problem, and that is the avalanche of drugs that is poring into our country and virtually destroying those countries.

MONDALE","Text":"One of the key tests of leadership is whether one sees clearly the nature of the problems confronted by our nation. And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits. I respect the President; I respect the Presidency, and I think he knows that. But the fact of it is, every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars. As a matter of fact, over 4 years, they\u2019ve missed the mark by nearly $600 billion. We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983. It was $200 billion deficit instead. And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether we\u2019ll deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery. Virtually every economic analysis that I\u2019ve heard of, including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a $263 billion deficit. In other words, it doesn\u2019t converge as the President suggests. It gets larger even with growth. What that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade. This is the worst trade year in American history by far. Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation. Real interest rates \u2014 the real cost of interest \u2014 will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that we\u2019re moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession. I get it down to a level below 2 percent of gross national product with a policy that\u2019s fair. I\u2019ve stood up and told the American people that I think it\u2019s a real problem, that it can destroy long-term economic growth, and I\u2019ve told you what I think should be done. I think this is a test of leadership, and I think the American people know the difference."}

And it\u2019s also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children. The President says it will disappear overnight because of some reason. No one else believes that\u2019s the case. I do, and I\u2019m standing up to the issue with an answer that\u2019s fair. I think that\u2019s what leadership is all about. There\u2019s a difference between being a quarterback and a cheerleader, and when there\u2019s a real problem, a President must confront it. What I was referring to, of course, in the comment that you referred to was the situation in Lebanon. Now, for three occasions, one after another, our Embassies were assaulted in the same way by a truck with demolitions. The first time \u2014 and I did not criticize the President, because these things can happen \u2014 once, and sometimes twice \u2014 the second time the barracks in Lebanon were assaulted, as we all remember. There was two or three commission reports, recommendations by the CIA, the State Department, and the others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves. Now, I believe that a President must command that White House and those who work for him. It\u2019s the toughest job on Earth, and you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done. I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is what\u2019s needed, because all my life that has been the way in which I have sought to lead. And that\u2019s why in this campaign I\u2019m telling you exactly what I want to do. I am answering your questions. I am trying to provide leadership now, before the election, so that the American people can participate in that decision."}

MONDALE","Text":"Well, I think we\u2019re getting better all the time. And I think tonight, as we contrast for the first time our differing approach to government, to values, to the leadership in this country, I think as this debate goes forward, the American people will have for the first time a chance to weigh the two of us against each other. And I think, as a part of that process, what I am trying to say will come across, and that is that we must lead, we must command, we must direct, and a President must see it like it is. He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for, and he must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world."}

RIDINGS","Speaker":"THE PRESIDENT","Text":"Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor, since you\u2019ve asked it. And, incidentally, I might say that with regard to the 25-percent cut in Social Security \u2014 before I get to the answer to your question \u2014 the only 25-percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase, was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916. Now, leadership. First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in. In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society \u2014 that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society. Now, having that, I think also that in leadership \u2014 well, I believe that you find people, positions such as I\u2019m in who have the talent and ability to do the things that are needed in the various departments of government. I don\u2019t believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who\u2019s going to play tennis on the White House court. And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy, not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job. You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job. But I also believe something else about that. I believe that \u2014 and when I became Governor of California, I started this, and I continue it in this office \u2014 that any issue that comes before me, I have instructed Cabinet members and staff they are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue. I don\u2019t want to hear them. I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people \u2014 is it morally right? And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue. Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they weren\u2019t to be abhorred \u2014 that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment."}

We have believed in partnership, and that was an example of a partnership between, not only local government and the Federal Government but also between the private sector that built that particular structure. And this is what we\u2019ve been trying to do, is involve the Federal Government in such partnerships. We are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people, and we\u2019re going to continue along that line. We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow, whether because of age or need. We have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country, and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need. The safety net is there, and we\u2019re taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country."}

He said, \u201cIt\u2019s not what he doesn\u2019t know that bothers me; it\u2019s what he knows for sure that just ain\u2019t so.\u201d  The fact of it is: The President\u2019s budget sought to cut Social Security by 25 percent. It\u2019s not an opinion; it\u2019s a fact. And when the President was asked the other day, \u201cWhat do you want to cut in the budget?\u201d, he said, \u201cCut those things I asked for but didn\u2019t get.\u201d That\u2019s Social Security and Medicare. The second fact is that the housing unit for senior citizens that the President dedicated in Buffalo was only made possible through a Federal assistance program for senior citizens that the President\u2019s budget sought to terminate. So, if he\u2019d had his way, there wouldn\u2019t have been any housing project there at all. This administration has taken a meat cleaver out, in terms of Federal-assisted housing, and the record is there. We have to see the facts before we can draw conclusions."}

RIDINGS","Speaker":"THE PRESIDENT","Text":"Well, let me just respond with regard to Social Security. When we took office, we discovered that the program that the Carter-Mondale administration had said would solve the fiscal problems of Social Security for the next 50 years wouldn\u2019t solve them for 5. Social Security was due to go bankrupt before 1983. Any proposals that I made at that time were at the request of the chairman, a Democrat, of one of the leading committees, who said we have to do something before the program goes broke and the checks bounce. And so, we made a proposal. And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign. And 3 days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said, Social Security, we know, is broke. Indeed, we had to borrow $17 billion to pay the checks. And then I asked for a bipartisan commission, which I\u2019d asked for from the beginning, to sit down and work out a solution. And so, the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation, and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century."}

At the same time, however, I have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign \u2014 or religion a part of that campaign. As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr. Mondale\u2019s running mate said I wasn\u2019t a good Christian. So, it does play a part in my life. I have no hesitancy in saying so. And, as I say, I don\u2019t believe that I could carry on unless I had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered."}

MONDALE","Text":"First of all, I accept President Reagan\u2019s affirmation of faith. I\u2019m sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith, and we are strengthened, all of us, by that fact. I am a son of a Methodist minister. My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister. And I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve been born again, but I know I was born into a Christian family. And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency. Whether that helps or not, I don\u2019t know. I have a deep religious faith. Our family does. It is fundamental. It\u2019s probably the reason that I\u2019m in politics. I think our faith tells us, instructs us, about the moral life that we should lead. And I think we\u2019re all together on that. What bothers me is this growing tendency to try to use one\u2019s own personal interpretation of faith politically, to question others\u2019 faith, and to try to use the instrumentalities of government to impose those views on others. All history tells us that that\u2019s a mistake. When the Republican platform says that from here on out, we\u2019re going to have a religious test for judges before they\u2019re selected for the Federal court, and then Jerry Falwell announces that that means they get at least two Justices of the Supreme Court, I think that\u2019s an abuse of faith in our country. This nation is the most religious nation on Earth \u2014 more people go to church and synagogues than any other nation on Earth \u2014 and it\u2019s because we kept the politicians and the state out of the personal exercise of our faith. That\u2019s why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians. And I think if we want to continue \u2014 as I do \u2014 to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it."}

A minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do that, I admire. The fact that the faith speaks to us and that we are moral people, hopefully, I accept and rejoice in. It\u2019s when you try to use that to undermine the integrity of private political \u2014 or private religious faith and the use of the state is where \u2014 for the most personal decisions in American life \u2014 that\u2019s where I draw the line."}

RIDINGS","Speaker":"THE PRESIDENT","Text":"Yes, it\u2019s very difficult to rebut, because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale. I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there. The only attacks I have made are on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side, using the government, using the power of the courts and so forth to hinder that part of the Constitution that says the government shall not only not establish a religion, it shall not inhibit the practice of religion. And they have been using these things to have government, through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion. A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they can\u2019t do it because it\u2019s school property. These are they types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation, and I am opposed to that. With regard to a platform on the Supreme Court, I can only say one thing about that. I have appointed one member to the Supreme Court - Sandra Day O\u2019Connor. I\u2019ll stand on my record on that. And if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, I\u2019ll do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her."}

We\u2019ve never had any difficulty finding time to pray. But do we want a constitutional amendment adopted of the kind proposed by the President that gets the local politicians into the business of selecting prayers that our children must either recite in school or be embarrassed and asked to excuse themselves? Who would write the prayer? What would it say? How would it be resolved when those disputes occur? It seems to me that a moment\u2019s reflection tells you why the United States Senate turned that amendment down, because it will undermine the practice of honest faith in our country by politicizing it.

And when people vote, I think you\u2019re going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favor the approach that I\u2019m talking about. The American people want arms control. They don\u2019t want this arms race. And they don\u2019t want this deadly new effort to bring weapons into the heavens. And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world. The American people see this debt, and they know it\u2019s got to come down. And if it won\u2019t come down, the economy\u2019s going to slow down, maybe go into a recession. They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history. And they know this debt must come down as well, because it\u2019s unfair to our children. The American people want this environment protected. They know that these toxic waste dumps should have been cleaned up a long time ago, and they know that people\u2019s lives and health are being risked, because we\u2019ve had an administration that has been totally insensitive to the law and the demand for the protection of the environment. The American people want their children educated. They want to get our edge back in science, and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap that\u2019s widening between the United States and Europe and Japan. The American people want to keep opening doors. They want those civil rights laws enforced. They want the equal rights amendment ratified. They want equal pay for comparable effort for women. And they want it because they\u2019ve understood from the beginning that when we open doors, we\u2019re all stronger, just as we were at the Olympics. I think as you make the case, the American people will increasingly come to our cause."}

But I\u2019m running on the record of what we have asked for. We\u2019ll continue to try to get things that we didn\u2019t get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 6.1 percent, a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and State governments that has been unjustly seized by the Federal Government. And you might find those words in a Democratic platform of some years ago \u2014 I know, because I was a Democrat at that time. And I left the party eventually, because I could no longer follow the turn in the Democratic leadership that took us down an entirely different path, a path of centralizing authority in the Federal Government, lacking trust in the American people. I promised, when we took office, that we would reduce inflation. We have, to one-third of what it was. I promised that we would reduce taxes. We did, 25 percent across the board. That barely held even with \u2014 if it did that much \u2014 with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977. But at least it took that burden away from them. I said that we would create jobs for our people, and we did \u2014 6 million in the last 20 or 21 months. I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons. We have done that. All of the things that I said we would do, from inflation being down, interest rates being down, unemployment falling, all of those things we have done. And I think this is something the American people see. I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education \u2014 on excellence in education. And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems. We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth. All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years. So, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw - The leadership isn\u2019t taking us where we want to go."}

I think that we\u2019ve had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide. The environment? Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment. When we took office, we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features, that we stopped buying additional park land until we had rectified this with what was to be a 5-year program \u2014 but it\u2019s just about finished already \u2014 a billion dollars.

There are some other things that have been said here \u2014 back, and you said that I might be able to dredge them up. Mr. Mondale referred to the farmers\u2019 worst year. The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done. The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 21\\1\/2\\-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier. All of these things are presently being rectified, and I think that we are going to salvage the farmers.

Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life. But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is \u2014 there\u2019s been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government. With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it\u2019s a problem of the Constitution. I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us. And I think that this is what we should concentrate on, is trying \u2014 I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee, there were medical authorities, there were religious \u2014 there were clerics there \u2014 everyone talking about this matter of prolife. And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive. We have seen premature births that are now grown-up, happy people going around. Also, there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life. In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor \u2014 signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder. Now, isn\u2019t it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child, and it was abortion and not murder, but if somebody else does it, that\u2019s murder? And it used the term \u201cdeath of the unborn child.\u201d So, this has been my feeling about abortion, that we have a problem now to determine \u2014 and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being."}

It was only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that the Federal Government intervened in what had always been a State policy. Our laws against murder are State laws. So, I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this. As I say, I feel that we have a problem here to resolve. And no one has approached it from that matter. It does not happen that the church that I belong to had that as part of its dogma. I know that some churches do. Now, it is a sin if you\u2019re taking a human life. At the same time, in our Judeo-Christian tradition, we recognize the right of taking a human life in self-defense. And therefore, I\u2019ve always believed that a mother, if medically it is determined that her life is at risk if she goes through with the pregnancy, she has a right then to take the life of even her own unborn child in defense of her own."}

MONDALE","Text":"This is one of the most emotional and difficult issues that could possibly be debated. I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people. The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest. Is it really the view of the American people, however you feel on the question of abortion, that government ought to be reaching into your livingrooms and making choices like this? I think it cannot work, won\u2019t work, and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law. Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them. The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do. I think these questions are inherently personal and moral, and every individual instance is different. Every American should be aware of the seriousness of the step. But there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do. Now, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion. Somebody went to a woman and nearly killed her. That\u2019s always been a serious crime and always should be a serious crime. But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped? Do we really want those decisions made by judges who\u2019ve been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty? I don\u2019t think so, and I think it\u2019s going in exactly the wrong direction. In America, on basic moral questions we have always let the people decide in their own personal lives. We haven\u2019t felt so insecure that we\u2019ve reached for the club of state to have our point of view. It\u2019s been a good instinct. And we\u2019re the most religious people on Earth. One final point - President Reagan, as Governor of California, signed a bill which is perhaps the most liberal proabortion bill of any State in the Union."}

Now, I\u2019m not capable, and I don\u2019t think you are, any of us, to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life. I am simply saying that I believe that that\u2019s where the effort should be directed \u2014 to make that determination. I don\u2019t think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition. That, too, would have to be worked out then, when you once recognize that we\u2019re talking about a life. But in this great society of ours, wouldn\u2019t it make a lot more sense, in this gentle and kind society, if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child, that instead we make it available for the adoption? There are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who can\u2019t have them any other way."}

Since I\u2019ve got about 20 seconds, let me just say one thing. The question of agriculture came up a minute ago. Net farm income is off 50 percent in the last 3 years, and every farmer knows it. And the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo, which has caused farm exports to drop 20 percent. It\u2019s been a big failure. I opposed the grain embargo in my administration. I\u2019m opposed to these policies as well."}

MONDALE","Text":"In my opinion, as we deal with this deficit, people from about $70,000 a year on down have to be dealt with very, very carefully, because they are the ones who didn\u2019t get any relief the first time around. Under the 1981 tax bill, people making $200,000 a year got $60,000 in tax relief over 3 years, while people making $30,000 a year, all taxes considered, got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up. That\u2019s why my proposal protects everybody from $25,000 a year or less against any tax increases, and treats those $70,000 and under in a way that is more beneficial than the way the President proposes with a sales tax or a flat tax. What does this mean in real life? Well, the other day, Vice President Bush disclosed his tax returns to the American people. He\u2019s one of the wealthiest Americans, and he\u2019s our Vice President. In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes. In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12.8 percent in taxes. That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work. I believe we need some fairness. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people who\u2019ve already got no relief or actually got a tax increase."}

They hit middle- and moderate-income Americans and leave wealthy Americans largely untouched. Up until about $70,000, as you go up the ladder, my proposals will be far more beneficial. As soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well, I\u2019d like to see the total repeal of indexing. I don\u2019t think we can do that for a few years.

RIDINGS","Speaker":"THE PRESIDENT","Text":"You know, I wasn\u2019t going to say this at all, but I can\u2019t help it. There you go again.  I don\u2019t have a plan to tax \u2014 or increase taxes. I\u2019m not going to increase taxes. I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes. Now, I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed; it\u2019s that government is overfed. And I think that most of our people \u2014 this is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up. And, as a matter of fact, it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes, those above $50,000 actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage-wise as did those from 50,000 down. From 50,000 down, those people paid two-thirds of the taxes, and those people got two-thirds of the tax cut. Now, the Social Security tax of \u201977 \u2014 this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest. It had two features. It had several tax increases phased in over a period of time \u2014 there are two more yet to come between now and 1989. At the same time every year, it increased the amount of money \u2014 virtually every year, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there \u2014 that was subject to that tax. Today it is up to about $38,000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for Social Security. And that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, 20 \u2014 they\u2019re paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money. Now, I don\u2019t think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesn\u2019t work out that way. The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as I\u2019ve said, and that has not been changed. But if you take it in numbers of dollars instead of percentage, yes, you could say, well, that person got 10 times as much as this other person. Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also. But if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board."}

I don\u2019t foresee those things happening, so I say with great confidence I\u2019m not going to go for a tax. With regard to assailing Mr. Bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid, I think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there \u2014 had to do, possibly, with the sale of his home, and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust. All of those are legally deductions, deductible in computing your tax, and it was a 1-year thing with him."}

Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here. It has begun to decline, but it is still going up. On the other hand, women heads of household \u2014 single women heads of household have \u2014 for the first time there\u2019s been a turndown in the rate of poverty for them. We have found also in our studies that in this increase in poverty, it all had to do with their private earnings. It had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs. We are spending now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980. We\u2019re spending a third more on all of the \u2014 well, all of the programs of human service. We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before \u2014 2,300,000 more are receiving them \u2014 even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them. We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits. We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy. Some time ago, Mr. Mondale said something about education and college students and help of that kind. Half \u2014 one out of two of the full-time college students in the United States are receiving some form of Federal aid. But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans. We didn\u2019t think that was right. And so, we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college, their family incomes were so low. So, there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been, taking care of more people than they ever have. 7.7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest 20 percent of earnings \u2014 7.7 million have moved up into another bracket since our administration took over, leaving only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there had been more than 13 million."}

And it is a wonderful thing to see when you get out there among the people. So, that was the only place that that was used. I did avoid, I\u2019m afraid, in my previous answer, also, the idea of uneven, yes. There is no way that the recovery is even across the country, just as in the depths of the recession, there were some parts of the country that were worse off, but some that didn\u2019t even feel the pain of the recession.

Number two, we have to work with cities and others to help generate economic growth in those communities \u2014 through the Urban Development Action Grant Program. I don\u2019t mind those enterprise zones; let\u2019s try them, but not as a substitute for the others. Certainly education and training is crucial. If these young Americans don\u2019t have the skills that make them attractive to employees, they\u2019re not going to get jobs. The next thing is to try to get more entrepreneurship in business within the reach of minorities so that these businesses are located in the communities in which they\u2019re found. The other thing is, we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth. There is no question that the poor are worse off. I think the President genuinely believes that they\u2019re better off. But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago. How you can cut school lunches, how you can cut student assistance, how you can cut housing, how you can cut disability benefits, how you can do all of these things and then the people receiving them \u2014 for example, the disabled, who have no alternative \u2014 how they\u2019re going to do better, I don\u2019t know. Now, we need a tight budget, but there\u2019s no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and they\u2019re hurting. One final point if I might. There\u2019s another part of the lopsided economy that we\u2019re in today, and that is that these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports. We are now $120 billion of imports, 3 million jobs lost, and farmers are having their worst year. That\u2019s another reason to get the deficit down."}

There is a connection between interest rates and inflation, but I would call to your attention that in 1981 while we were operating still on the Carter-Mondale budget that we inherited \u2014 that the interest rates came down from 21\\1\/2\\, down toward the 12 or 13 figure. And while they were coming down, the deficits had started their great increase. They were going up. Now, if there was a connection I think that there would be a different parallel between deficits getting larger and interest rates going down. The interest rates are based on inflation. And right now I have to tell you I don\u2019t think there is any excuse for the interest rates being as high as they are because we have brought inflation down so low. I think it can only be that they\u2019re anticipating or hope \u2014 expecting, not hoping, that maybe we don\u2019t have a control of inflation and it\u2019s going to go back up again.

And the result is interest costs that have never been seen before in terms of real charges, and it\u2019s attributable to the deficit.

If you reduce the out-go of Social Security, that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit. It would go into the Social Security Trust Fund. So, Social Security has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit. Now, again, to get to whether I am depending on magic, I think I have talked in straight economic terms about a program of recovery that I was told wouldn\u2019t work.

In 1979 he made similar statements, the same effect, that the deficits \u2014 there was nothing wrong with having deficits. Remember, there was a trillion dollars in debt before we got here.

But I will say as a Democrat, I was a real piker, Mr. President. In 1979 we ran a $29 billion deficit all year. This administration seems to run that every morning. And the result is exactly what we see. This economy is starting to run downhill. Housing is off. Last report on new purchases, it\u2019s the lowest since 1982. Growth is a little over 3 percent now. Many people are predicting a recession. And the flow of imports into this country is swamping the American people. We\u2019ve got to deal with this problem, and those of us who want to be your President should tell you now what we\u2019re going to do, so you can make a judgment."}

RIDINGS","Speaker":"THE PRESIDENT","Text":"Four years ago, in similar circumstances to this, I asked you, the American people, a question. I asked: \u201cAre you better off than you were 4 years before?\u201d The answer to that obviously was no, and as the result, I was elected to this office and promised a new beginning. Now, maybe I\u2019m expected to ask that same question again. I\u2019m not going to, because I think that all of you \u2014 or not everyone, those people that are in those pockets of poverty and haven\u2019t caught up, they couldn\u2019t answer the way I would want them to \u2014 but I think that most of the people in this country would say, yes, they are better off than they were 4 years ago. The question, I think, should be enlarged. Is America better off than it was 4 years ago? And I believe the answer to that has to also be \u201cyes.\u201d I promised a new beginning. So far, it is only a beginning. If the job were finished, I might have thought twice about seeking reelection for this job. But we now have an economy that, for the first time \u2014 well, let\u2019s put it this way: In the first half of 1980, gross national product was down a minus 3.7 percent. The first half of \u201984 it\u2019s up 8\\1\/2\\ percent. Productivity in the first half of 1980 was down a minus 2 percent. Today it is up a plus 4 percent. Personal earnings after taxes per capita have gone up almost $3,000 in these 4 years. In 1980 \u2014 or 1979, a person with a fixed income of $8,000 was $500 above the poverty line, and this maybe explains why there are the numbers still in poverty. By 1980 that same person was $500 below the poverty line. We have restored much of our economy. With regard to business investment, it is higher than it has been since 1949. So, there seems to be no shortage of investment capital. We have, as I said, cut the taxes, but we have reduced inflation, and for 2 years now it has stayed down there, not at double digit, but in the range of 4 or below. We believe that we had also promised that we would make our country more secure. Yes, we have an increase in the defense budget. But back then we had planes that couldn\u2019t fly for lack of spare parts or pilots. We had navy vessels that couldn\u2019t leave harbor because of lack of crew or, again, lack of spare parts. Today we\u2019re well on our way to a 600-ship navy. We have 543 at present. We have \u2014 our military, the morale is high. I think the people should understand that two-thirds of the defense budget pays for pay and salary, or pay and pension. And then you add to that food and wardrobe, and all the other things, and you only have a small portion going for weapons. But I am determined that if ever our men are called on, they should have the best that we can provide in the manner of tools and weapons. There has been reference to expensive spare parts, hammers costing $500. Well, we are the ones who found those. I think we\u2019ve given the American people back their spirit. I think there\u2019s an optimism in the land and a patriotism, and I think that we\u2019re in a position once again to heed the words of Thomas Paine, who said: \u201cWe have it in our power to begin the world over again.\u201d"}

MONDALE","Text":"I want to thank the League of Women Voters and the city of Louisville for hosting this evening\u2019s debate. I want to thank President Reagan for agreeing to debate. He didn\u2019t have to, and he did, and we all appreciate it. The President\u2019s favorite question is: Are you better off? Well, if you\u2019re wealthy, you\u2019re better off. If you\u2019re middle income, you\u2019re about where you were. And if you\u2019re modest income, you\u2019re worse off. That\u2019s what the economists tell us. But is that really the question that should be asked? Isn\u2019t the real question is will we be better off? Will our children be better off? Are we building the future that this nation needs? I believe that if we ask those questions that bear on our future, not just congratulate ourselves but challenge us to solve those problems, you\u2019ll see that we need new leadership. Are we better of with this arms race? Will we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens? Are we better off when we deemphasize our values in human rights? Are we better off when we load our children with this fantastic debt? Would fathers and mothers feel proud of themselves if they loaded their children with debts like this nation is now \u2014 over a trillion dollars on the shoulders of our children? Can we say, really say that we will be better off when we pull away from sort of that basic American instinct of decency and fairness? I would rather lose a campaign about decency than win a campaign about self-interest. I don\u2019t think this nation is composed of people who care only for themselves. And when we sought to assault Social Security and Medicare, as the record shows we did, I think that was mean-spirited. When we terminated 400,000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability \u2014 confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for 4 years, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what America is all about. America is a fair society, and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him. I believe there\u2019s fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system. I believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment. And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful. These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price. That\u2019s not fair for our future. I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training, because this world is more complex and we\u2019re being pressed harder all the time. I believe in opening doors. We won the Olympics, in part, because we\u2019ve had civil rights laws and the laws that prohibit discrimination against women. I have been for those efforts all my life. The President\u2019s record is quite different. The question is our future. President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, \u201cWe are great, but we can be greater.\u201d We can be better if we face our future, rejoice in our strengths, face our problems, and by solving them, build a better society for our children. Thank you."}

One of the reasons I think we\u2019re an effective team is that I believe firmly in his leadership. He\u2019s really turned this country around. We agree on the economic program. When we came into office, why, inflation was 21, 12 1\/2 percent interest was wiping out every single American were 21 1\/2 percent if you can believe it. Productivity was down. Savings was down. There was despair. In fact, the leadership of the country told the people that there was a malaise out there. And this president turned it around and I\u2019ve been with him every step of the way. And of course I would continue those kinds of programs because it\u2019s brought America back. America\u2019s better off. People are going back to work. And why Mr. Monad can\u2019t understand that there\u2019s a new enthusiasm in this country, that America is back, there\u2019s new strong leadership, I don\u2019t know. He has one answer to the problem. Raise everybody\u2019s taxes. He looked right into that lens and he said out there in San Francisco, he said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna raise your taxes.\u201d Well he\u2019s had a lot of experience in that and he\u2019s sure gonna go ahead and do it. But I remember a statement of Lyndon Johnson\u2019s when he was looking around, why his party people weren\u2019t supporting him, and he said, \u201cHey, they painted their tails white and they ran with the antelopes.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of Democratic white tails running with the antelopes. Not one single Democrat has introduced the Mondale tax bill into the Congress. Of course I support the president\u2019s economic program and I support him in everything else. And I\u2019m not sure, because of my concept of the vice presidency, that if I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d go doing what Mr. Mondale has done with Jimmy Carter; jump away from him. I couldn\u2019t do that to Ronald Reagan, now, next year or any other time. I have too much trust in him. I have too much friendship for him. And I\u2019d feel very uncomfortable doing that."}

I was a prosecutor for almost five years in the district attorney\u2019s office in Queens County and I was a teacher. There\u2019s not only what is on your paper resume that makes you qualified to run for or to hold office. It\u2019s how you approach problems and what your values are. I think if one is taking a look at my career they\u2019ll see that I level with the people; that I approach problems analytically; that I am able to assess the various facts with reference to a problem, and I can make the hard decisions. I\u2019m intrigued when I hear Vice-President Bush talk about his support of the president\u2019s economic program and how everything is just going so beautifully. I, too, recall when Vice President Bush was running in the primary against President Reagan and he called the program voodoo economics, and it was and it is. We are facing absolutely massive deficits; this administration has chosen to ignore it; the president has failed to put forth a plan to deal with those deficits and if everything believes that everything is corning up roses, perhaps the vice-president should join me as I travel around the country and speak to people. People in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, are not terribly thrilled with what\u2019s happening in the economy because they\u2019re standing in the light of a closed plant because they\u2019ve lost their jobs. The people in Youngstown, Ohio, have stores that are boarded up because the economy is not doing well. It\u2019s not only the old industries that are failing, it\u2019s also the new ones. In San Jose, California, they\u2019re complaining because they can\u2019t export their high-tech qualities \u2013 goods \u2013 to Japan and other countries. The people in the Northwest \u2013 in the state of Washington and Oregon \u2013 are complaining about what\u2019s happening to the timber industry and to the agriculture industry. So, so things are not as great as the administration is wanting us to believe in their television commercials. My feeling, quite frankly, is that I have enough experience to see the problems, address them and make the tough decisions and level with people with reference to those problems."}

I just don\u2019t agree on the same direction he does on how to achieve it. But I don\u2019t find any problem with that. I think that\u2019s been something that\u2019s been handled by the courts, and not being handled by Congress and will not be handled by the White House. But we both support nondiscrimination in housing and integration of neighborhoods. The goals we both set forth. With reference to tuition tax credits, I have represented a district in Queens which is 70 percent Catholic. I represented my district. Let me say as well that I have also been a great supporter of public school education and that is something that Fritz and I feel very, very strongly about for the future of this country. And this administration over the past several years has gutted the educational programs available to our young people. It has attempted to knock out Pell Grants, which are monies to young individuals who are poor and who cannot afford to go to college. It has reduced by 25 percent the amount of monies going into college education and by a third those going into secondary and primary schools. But Fritz Mondale and I feel very strongly that if you educate your children that that\u2019s an effort and the way that you build up and make a stronger America. With reference to civil rights I think you\u2019ve got to go beyond that and if you take a look, also, at my record in the Congress and Fritz Mondale\u2019s record, both in the Senate and as vice president, we both have extremely strong civil rights records. This administration does not. It has come in in the Bob Jones on the side of segregated academies. It came in in the Grove City case on the side of discrimination against women, the handicapped, and the elderly. As a matter of fact, in the Congress we just passed overwhelmingly the Civil Rights Bill of 1984 and this administration, the Republican-controlled Senate, just killed it in the last week or two in Congress. So there is a real difference between how the Mondale-Ferraro administration will address the problems of civil rights and the failure of this administration specifically in that particular area."}

We don\u2019t feel that you\u2019re in any way hurting anybody else by reaching out with affirmative action to help those who\u2019ve been disenfranchised. On the contrary, if you have a growing economy, if you create the jobs, if you allow for small business the opportunity with lower interest rates to reach out and grow, there will be more than enough space for everybody.

You mentioned the Voting Rights extension; it was extended for the longest period of time by President Reagan. But we have some problems in attracting the black vote, and I think our record deserves better. We have done more for black colleges than any previous administration. We favor enterprise zones to give \u2013 and it\u2019s been blocked by Tip O\u2019Neill and that House of Representatives, those liberals in that House blocked a new idea to bring jobs into the black communities across the country. And because it\u2019s not an old handout, special federal spending program, it\u2019s blocked there \u2013 a good idea. And I\u2019d like to sec that tried. We\u2019ve brought more civil rights cases in the Justice Department than the previous administration by far. We believe in trying something new to help these black teenage kids; the minimum wage differential that says, \u201cLook,\u201d to an employer, \u201chire these guys. And, yes, they\u2019re willing to work for slightly less than the minimum wage. Give \u2019em a training job in the private sector.\u201d We threw out that old CETA that didn\u2019t train people for jobs that existed, simply rammed them onto the government payroll, and we put in a thing called the Job Training Partnership Act. Wonderful new legislation that\u2019s helping blacks more and more. We think of civil rights as something like crime in your neighborhoods. And, for example, when crime figures are going in the right direction that\u2019s good, that\u2019s a civil right. Similarly, we think of it in terms of quality of life, and that means interest rates. You know, it\u2019s funny, Mr. Mondale talks about real interest rates. The real interest rate is what you pay when you go down and try to buy a TV set or buy a car, or do whatever it is. The interest rates when we left office were 21% percent. Inflation! Is it a civil right to have the going right off the chart so you\u2019re busting every American family, those who can afford it the least? No, we\u2019ve got a good record. We\u2019ve got it on civil rights legislation, minority set-asides, more help for black colleges, and we\u2019ve got it in terms of an economy that\u2019s offering people opportunity and hope instead of despair."}

You don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to prohibit a kid from praying in schools. For years kids were allowed to pray in schools. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s a merger of church and stare to have nonmandatory voluntary, nongovernment-ordered prayer. And yet some are accusing us of injecting religion into politics. I have no problem with what the archbishop does, and I have no problem with what the evangelists on the right do and I have no problem what the priests on the left do. And it didn\u2019t bother me when during the Vietnam War much of the opposition to the government \u2013 Democrat and Republican governments \u2013 was led by priests, encouraging people to break the law and the adage of the \u2013 you know \u2013 the civil disobedience thing. So our position, separation of church and stare, pluralism, so no little kid with a minority religion of some sort is going to feel offended or feel left out or feel uncomfortable. But, yes, prayer in school on a voluntary basis worked for many, many years until the Supreme Court ruled differently And I\u2019m glad we got this question because I think there\u2019s been too much said about religion and politics. We don\u2019t believe in denominationally moving in. It wasn\u2019t our side that raised the question about our president whether he was a good Christian or not and so I, so that\u2019s our position \u2013 separation of church and state, pluralism, respect for all."}

I\u2019m taking it from the historical viewpoint, if you go back to the 1600s when people came here, the reason they came to this country was to escape religious persecution, and that\u2019s the same reason why people are coming here today in the 1940s to escape Nazism, now in the 1980s and 1984 when they can get our of the country to escape communism so they can come here and practice their religion. Our country is founded on the principle that our government should be neutral as far as religion is concerned. Now what\u2019s happened over the past several years, and quite frankly I\u2019m not going to let you lay on me the intrusion of state politics into religion or religion into politics by my comments with reference to the president\u2019s policies, because it started in 1980 when this administration was running for office and the Reverend Jerry Falwell became very, very involved in the campaign. What has happened over the past four years has been I think a real fudging of that line with the separation of church and state. The actions of the archbishops let me say to you I feel that they have not only a right but a responsibility to speak up, and even though I\u2019ve been the person that they\u2019re speaking up about, l feel they do have the responsibility to do so, and I have no problem with it, no more than I did a priest who marched at the time of Vietnam and no more than I did at the time when Martin Luther King marched at the time of the civil rights marches. I have absolutely no problem with them speaking up, I think they have an obligation as well as a right. But what I do have a problem with is when the president of the United States gets up in Dallas and addresses a group of individuals and said to them that anybody who doesn\u2019t support his constitutional amendment for prayer in the schools is intolerant of religion. Now there are numerous groups who don\u2019t support that prayer in the school, numerous religious groups. Are they intolerant of religion? Is that what the president is saying? I also object, when I am told, that the Reverend Falwell has been told that he would pick two of our Supreme Court justices. That\u2019s going a little bit far. In that instance, let me say to you it is more than a fudging at the line, it is a total intrusion, and I think that it\u2019s in violation of our Constitution."}

When I was running for Congress 1978 I sat and met with a person I felt very close to, a monsignor currently a bishop. I spoke to him about my personal feelings that I would never have an abortion, but I was not quite sure if I were ever to become pregnant as result of a rape if I would be that self-righteous. I then spoke to him; he said, Gerry, that\u2019s not good enough. There you can\u2019t support that position. I said okay. That\u2019s my religious view; I will accept the teaching of the church, but I cannot impose my religious views on someone else. I truly take an oath as a public official to represent all the people in my district, not only the Catholics. If there comes a time where I cannot practice my religion and do my job properly, I will resign my job."}

That year I happened to pay a lot of state and local taxes, which as you know are deducted from the other, and so I looked it up the other day, and we had paid \u2013 I think it\u2019s 42 percent \u2013 of our gross income in taxes. Now Mr. Mondale the other night took what I \u2013 I\u2019ll be honest \u2013 I think it was a cheap shot \u2013 at me, and we did a little looking around to see about his. We can\u2019t find his 198I tax return \u2013 it may have been released. Maybe my opponent knows whether Mr. Mondale released it. But we did find estimates that his income for those three years is a million, four hundred thousand dollars, and I think he paid about the same percentage as I did in total taxes. He also made a reference that troubled me very much, Mr. Boyd. He started talking about my chauffeur, and you know, I\u2019m driven to work by the Secret Service \u2013 so is Mrs. Ferraro \u2013 so is Mr. Mondale \u2013 they protected his life for four years and now they\u2019ve done a beautiful job for Barbara and mine. They saved the life of the president of the United States. I think that was a cheap shot \u2013 telling the American people to try to divide class \u2013 rich and poor. But the big question isn\u2019t whether Mrs. Ferraro is doing well. I think they\u2019re doing pretty well, and I know Barbara and I are doing well. And it\u2019s darn sure that Mr. Mondale is doing well, with a million four in income, but the question really is \u2013 after we get through this disclosure \u2013 is the tax cut fair? Are people getting a fair break, and the answer is the rich are paying 6 percent more on taxes and the poor are getting a better break. Those lower and middle-income people that have borne the burden for a long time. So yes, I favor disclosure. I\u2019ve always disclosed. This year I had my taxes and everything I own in a blind trust \u2013 so blind \u2013 blinder than the president\u2019s, so I didn\u2019t even sign my tax return. But there seemed to be an interest in it so we went to the government ethics committee \u2013 they agreed to change the trust. The trust has been revealed, and I was sure glad to see that I had paid 42 percent of my gross income in taxes."}

If you earn $200,000 a year, you got a $25,000 tax cut. If you earned between $20,000 and $40,000, you may have gotten about $1,000 between ten and twenty, close to a hundred dollars and if you made less than $10,000 with all the budget cuts that came down the line, you suffered a loss of $400. That\u2019s not fair. That\u2019s basically unfair and not only is it unfair, but economically it has darn near destroyed this country.

When you see the Israeli building in Lebanon after the death of our marines you see that, hit by terrorism, the Israelis, with all their experience fighting terrorism, you know it\u2019s difficult. When you see Khomeini wraith his radical Islam resorting to government-sponsored terrorism, it\u2019s very difficult. The intelligence business can do a good job, and I\u2019m always one that defends the Central Intelligence Agency. I believe we ought to strengthen it and I believe we still have the best foreign intelligence business in the world. But it is very difficult to get the source information that you need to go after something as shadowy as international terror. There was a difference between Iran and what happened in Lebanon. In Iran you had a government holding a U.S. embassy; the government sanctioning the takeover of that embassy by those students; the government negotiating with the United States government for their release. In Lebanon, in the terror that happened at the embassy, you have the government there, Mr. Gemayel, that wants to help fight against terrorism. But because of the melee in the Middle East, it\u2019s there today and has been there yesterday and the day before, and everyone that\u2019s had experience in that area knows, it is a very different thing. So what we\u2019ve got to do is use absolutely the best security possible. I don\u2019t think you can go assigning blame. The president, of course, is the best I\u2019ve ever seen at accepting that. He\u2019s been wonderful about it in absolutely everything that happens. But I think fair-minded people that really understand international terror know that it\u2019s very hard to guard against. And the answer then really lies in the Middle East and terrorism happening all over the world, is a solution to the Palestine question, the follow on to Camp David under the umbrella of the Reagan September of 1982 initiative. That will reduce terror, it won\u2019t eliminate it."}

But we do believe in reaching out to the, what they call the GCC, those Gulf Cooperative Council State, those moderate Arab states in that world, and helping them with defensive weapons to guard against international terror or radical Islam perpetuated by Khomeini.

It was at that time that President Reagan gave a speech welcoming them home \u2013 as America did, we were so excited to see them back. But what he said was: The United States has been embarrassed for the last time. We\u2019re going to stand tall and if this ever happens again, there\u2019s going to be swift and immediate steps taken to address the wrong that our country has founded \u2013 has suffered. In April of J983 I was in Beirut and visited the ambassador at the embassy. Two weeks later, that embassy was bombed. At that time \u2013 take a look at the crazy activities of terrorists, you can\u2019t blame that on anybody. They\u2019re going to do crazy things and you just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. The following October, there was another bombing and that bombing took place at the marine barracks, where there were 242 young men who were killed. Right after that bombing occurred, there was a commission set up called the Long Commission. That commission did a study of the security arrangements around where the marines were sleeping and found that there was negligence, that they did not have proper gates up, proper precautions to stop those trucks from coming in. And so the Long Commission issued a report, and President Reagan got up and he said: I\u2019m commander in chief. I take responsibility. And we all waited for something to be done when he look responsibility. Well, last month we had our third bombing, The first time, the first embassy, there was no gate up, The second time, with our Marines, the gate was open. The third time, the gate was there but it had not been installed. And what was the president\u2019s reaction? Well, the security arrangements were not in, our people were placed in that embassy in an unsecured time, and the marines who were guarding it were left to go away and there were other people guarding the embassy. Again the president said: I assume responsibility. I\u2019d like to know what that means. Are we going to take proper precautions before we put Americans in situations where they\u2019re in danger, or are we just going to walk away, throwing our arms in the air now \u2013 quite a reversal from the first time, from the first time when he said he was going to do something? Or is this President going to take some action?"}

Iran \u2013 we were held by a foreign government. In Lebanon you had a wanton, terrorist action where the government opposed it. We went to Lebanon to give peace a chance, to stop the bombing of civilians in Beirut, to remove 13,000 terrorists from Lebanon \u2013 and we did. We saw the formation of a government of reconciliation and for somebody to suggest, as our two opponents have, that these men died in shame \u2013 they better not tell the parents of those young marines.

They\u2019re moving in militarily instead of promoting the Contadora process, which, as you know, is the process that is in place with the support of Mexico and Colombia and Panama and Venezuela. Instead of supporting the process, our administration has in Nicaragua been supporting covert activities to keep that revolution going in order to overthrow the Sandinista government; in El Salvador was not pushing the head of the government to move toward correction of the civil rights; human rights problems that existed there, and now this administration seems almost befuddled by the fact that Nicaragua is moving to participate in the Contadora process, and El Salvador is, through its President Duarte, is reaching out to the guerrillas in order to negotiate a peace.

As a matter of fact the number of troops that the Sandinistas have accumulated since the administration started its covert activities has risen from 12,000 to 50,000, and of course the number of Soviet and Cuban advisors has also increased. I did not support the mining of the harbors in Nicaragua; it is a violation of international law. Congress did not support it and as a matter of fact, just this week, the Congress voted in cut off covert aid to Nicaragua unless and until a request is made and there is evidence of need for it, and the Congress approves it again in March. So if Congress doesn\u2019t get laid on, the covert activities which I opposed in Nicaragua, those CIA covert activities in that specific country, are not supported by the Congress. And believe it or not, not supported by the majority of people throughout the country."}

They don\u2019t believe in all of the values that we believe in. So it is our policy to support the democracy there, and when you have freedom fighters that want to protect that revolution, and go the democratic route, we believe in giving them support. We are for democracy in the hemisphere. We are for negotiations. $3 out of every $4 that we sent down there has been for economic aid to support the people\u2019s chance to eat and live and be happy and enjoy life.

Mr. Brezhnev, Mr. Andropov, and now Chernenko. During their, that, in three and a half years, three separate leaders. The Soviets have not been willing to talk. We are the ones that went to the table in INF. We had a good proposal, a moral proposal. Ban an entire generation of intermediate nuclear force weapons and if you won\u2019t do that, don\u2019t leave your allies in Europe in a monopoly position. The Soviets with 1,200 of these things, and the alliance with none. We didn\u2019t think that\u2019s the way to deter aggression and keep the peace. The president went, the first thing he did when he came into office was make a proposal on the most destabilizing weapons of all, START. And when the the strategic weapon and when the Soviets said, well, we don\u2019t like that proposal, we said all right, we\u2019ll be more flexible. I at the urging of the president went to Geneva and laid on the table a treaty to ban all chemical weapons. We don\u2019t want them to have a monopoly. We said look, let\u2019s come together. You come over here and see what we\u2019re doing; we\u2019ll go over there and see what you\u2019re doing. But let\u2019s save the kids of this world from chemical weapons. A brilliant proposal to get rid of all of them. And the Soviets nyet, nyet nyet. In the mutual balance force reduction to reduce conventional forces, they\u2019re not even willing to tell us the base. Mrs. Ferraro knows that, and how many troops they have. There\u2019s four sessions. We have had an agreement with them on the hot line. But Carter-Monad made an agreement, the Salt II agreement, but the Democratic Senate, they were a Democratic administration, the Democratic Senate wouldn\u2019t even ratify that agreement. It was flawed, it was unverifiable and it was not good. Our president wants to reduce, not just to stop, he wants to reduce dramatically nuclear weapons. And when the Soviets know they\u2019re going to have this strong president to deal with, and when this new administration, Mr. Chernenko, given more than a few months in office can solidify its position, then they\u2019ll talk. But if they think the opposition, before they sit down, are going to give up the MX, give up the B-l, go for a freeze that locks in inferiority in Europe, all of these things, unilaterally, before they\u2019re willing to talk, they may just sweat it out for four more weeks.

I wish everybody could have seen that one \u2013 the President, giving the facts to Gromyko in all of these nuclear meetings \u2013 excellent, right on top of that subject matter. And I\u2019ll bet you that Gromyko went back to the Soviet Union saying, \u201cHey, listen, this president is calling the shots; we\u2019d better move.\u201d But do you know why I think we\u2019ll get an agreement? Because I think it is in the interest of the Soviet Union to make it, just as it is in the United States. They\u2019re not deterred by rhetoric. I listened to the rhetoric for two years at the United Nations. I\u2019ve lived in a Communist country. It\u2019s not rhetoric that decides agreements, it\u2019s self-interest of those countries."}

And since today is Eleanor Roosevelt\u2019s 100th birthday, let me quote her. She said, \u201cIt is not enough to want peace, you must believe in it. And it is not enough to believe in it, you must work for it.\u201d This administration\u2019s policies have indicated quite the opposite. The last time I heard Vice President Bush blame the fact that they didn\u2019t meet with the Soviet leader, and this is the first president in forty years not to meet with a Soviet counterpart. He said the reason was because there are three Soviet leaders in the past three and a half years. I went and got a computer printout. It\u2019s five pages of the leaders, world leaders, that the Soviet leaders have met with, and they\u2019re not little people. They\u2019re people like Mitterrand of France and Kohl of Germany and President Kiprianou of Cyprus \u2013 you go down the list, five pages of people that the Soviet leaders have managed to meet with and somehow they couldn\u2019t meet with the president of the United States. In addition to not meeting with his Soviet counterpart, this is the first president \u2013 and you\u2019re right \u2013 since the start of negotiating arms control agreements who have not negotiated an arms control agreement, But not only has he not negotiated one, he\u2019s been opposed to every single one that every other president has negotiated, including Eisenhower, including Ford, and including Nixon. Now, let me just say that with reference to the vice-president\u2019s comments about the intent and the desire of the United Sites and this administration, the Soviet Union did walk out of the talks. I agree. But it seems to me in 1982, when the administration presented its Start proposal, that it wasn\u2019t a realistic proposal. And that is the comment that was made by Secretary Haig after he left office, because what it dealt with was that it dealt just with land-based nuclear missiles, which is where the Soviets had the bulk of their missiles. But that aside, in 1982, I believe it was, their own negotiator, Nitze, came out with a proposal called the \u201cwalk-in-the-woods proposal\u201d which would have limited the number of nuclear arms in Europe. That proposal was turned down by the administration \u2013 a proposal presented by its own administrator. Now I\u2019m delighted that they met with Mr. Gromyko, but they could have had that opportunity to meet with him in 1981 when he came to the UN, which he had done with every other president before, and in 1982 as well.

We\u2019ve been in very close touch with Mr. Mitterrand, Mr. Kohl, and others that have met with the leaders of the Soviet Union. But that\u2019s quite different than meeting with the president of the United States. The Soviets say we\u2019ll have a meeting when we think there can be progress and yet they left those talks. I\u2019d like to correct my opponent on the walk in the woods. It was the Soviet Union that was unwilling to discuss the walk in the woods. They were the ones that gunned it down first and the record is very, very clear on that. Miss Ferraro mentioned the inflexibility of our position on strategic arms. Yes, we offered first to get rid of all those \u2013 we tried to reduce the SS-18\u2019s and those weapons. But then we said if that\u2019s not good enough, there is flexibility, let\u2019s talk about the bombers and planes. So that\u2019s a very important point in terms of negotiation."}

I think what you can do is look at what they\u2019ve done and recognize that they\u2019re not going to do very much in the future. And so, since they\u2019ve done nothing, do we continue to build because an arms race doesn\u2019t lead to anything, it leads to another arms race and that\u2019s that. Vice President Monad has indicated that what he would do, first of all, as soon as he. gets into office, is contact his Soviet counterpart and set up an annual summit meeting. That\u2019s number one. I don\u2019t think you can start negotiating until you start talking. Secondly, he would issue a challenge, and the challenge would be in the nature of temporary, mutual, verifiable, moratoria to halt testing in the air, in the atmosphere, that would respond with a challenge from the Soviet Union, we hope, to sit down and negotiate a treaty. That was done in 1960. I don\u2019t know what your lights are doing, Sander."}

They did not. In two months they sat down and they negotiated a treaty. We do not now have to worry about that type of testing. It can be done; it will be done, if only you have the will to do it.

It\u2019s about as valid as saying that you would have to be black in order to despise racism, that you\u2019d have to be female in order to be terribly offended by sexism. And that\u2019s just not so. I think if you take a look at where I\u2019ve been, both in the Congress and where I intend to go, the type of person I am \u2013 I think that the people of this country can rely upon the fact that I will be a lender. I don\u2019t think the Soviet Union for one minute can sit down and make determination on what I will do if I\u2019m ever in a position to have to do something with reference to the Soviet Union. Quite frankly I\u2019m prepared to do whatever is necessary in order to secure this country and make sure that security is maintained. Secondly, if the Soviet Union were to ever believe that they could challenge the United States with any sort of nuclear forces or otherwise, if I were in a position of leadership in this country, they would be assured that they would be met with swift, concise and certain retaliation. Let me just say one other thing now. The most important thing, though I think as a leader that what one has to do is get to the point where you\u2019re not put into that position. And the way you to that position of rnoving away from having to make a decision \u2013 armed force or anything else \u2013 is by moving toward arms control. And that\u2019s not what\u2019s been done over the past four years. I think that if you were to take a look at the failures of this administration that would have to be number one. I will not put myself in that position as a leader in this country. I will move immediately toward arms control negotiations."}

Clearly, when we came into office, the American people recognized that we had slipped into positions of inferiority on various things. Some of our planes, as the president points out, were older than the pilots; ships that couldn\u2019t go out to sea. And you had a major problem with the military. Actually, the morale wasn\u2019t very good either. So we have had to strengthen the military and we\u2019re well on the way to getting that job done. America is back in terms of military strength, in terms of our ability to deter aggression and keep the peace. At the same time, however, we have made proposals and proposals and proposals \u2013 sound proposals \u2013 on reducing nuclear weapons. The Strategic Arms Reduction Talks were good proposals, and it\u2019s the Soviets who left the table. The Intermediate Nuclear Force Talks were sound talks, and I wish the Soviet Union had continued them. The chemical weapon treaty to ban all chemical weapons, it was our initiative, not the Soviets. And we wish they would think anew and move forward to verification so everybody would know whether the other side was keeping its word. But, much more important, you\u2019d reduce the level of terror. Similarly, we\u2019re reducing \u2013 trying to talk to them, and are talking to them, in Vienna, about conventional force reduction. We\u2019ve talked to them about human rights. I\u2019ve met with Mr. Andropov and Mr. Chernenko, and we mention and we try to do something about the human rights question. The suppression of Soviet Jews is absolutely intolerable and so we have to keep pushing forward on the moral grounds as well as on the arms reduction ground. But it is my view that because this president has been strong, and because we\u2019ve addressed the imbalances \u2013 and I think we\u2019re very close to getting that job done \u2013 the Soviets are more likely to make a deal. The Soviets made an ABM treaty when they felt we were going to deploy an ABM system. So I am optimistic for the future, once they realize that they will have this strong, principled president to negotiate with, strong leadership, and yet with demonstrable flexibility on arms control."}

We\u2019ve moved some of the power away from Washington, D.C., and put it back with the people. We\u2019re pulling together. The neighborhoods are safer \u2019cause crime is going down. Your sons and daughters are doing better in school. Test scores are going up. There\u2019s a new opportunity lying out there in the future. Science, technology and space offering opportunity that, to everybody, all the young ones coming up. And abroad there\u2019s new leadership and respect. And Ronald Reagan is clearly the strong leader of the free world. And I\u2019ll be honest with you. It\u2019s a joy to serve with a president who does not apologize for the United States of America. Mr. Mondale, on the other hand, has one idea. Go out and tax the American people. And then he wants to repeal indexing, to wipe out the one protection that those at the lowest end of the economic scale have protecting them against being rammed into higher and higher tax brackets. We just owe our country too much to go back to that kind of an approach. I\u2019d like to say something to the young people. I started a business. I know what it is to have a dream and have a job and work hard to employ others and really to participate in the American dream. Some of you out there are finishing high school or college and some of you are starting out in the working place. And we want for you America\u2019s greatest gift. And that is opportunity. And then, peace. Yes, I did serve in combat. I was shot down when I was a young kid, scared to death. And all that did, saw friends die, but that heightened my convictions about peace. It is absolutely essential that we guarantee the young people that they will not know the agony of war. America\u2019s gift, opportunity and peace. Now we do have some unfinished business. We must continue to go ahead. The world is too complex to go back to vacillation and weakness. We\u2019ve too much going on to go back to the failed policies of the past.

But it\u2019s not only a personal achievement for Geraldine Ferraro \u2013 and certainly not only the bond that I feel as I go across this country with women throughout the country. I wouldn\u2019t be standing here if Fritz Mondale didn\u2019t have the courage and my party didn\u2019t stand for the values that it does \u2013 the values of fairness and equal opportunity. Those values make our country strong and the future of this country and how strong it will be is what this election is all about. Over the last two months I\u2019ve been traveling all over the country talking to the people about the future. I was in Kentucky and I spoke to the Dyhouse family. He works for a car dealer and he\u2019s worried about the deficits and how high interest rates are going to affect his job. Every place I go I see young parents with their children and they say to me what are we going to do to stop this nuclear arms race. I was in Dayton, Ohio, a week and a half ago and I sat with the Allen family who live next door to a toxic dump and they\u2019re very, very concerned about the fact that those toxics are seeping into the water that they and their neighbors drink. Now those people love this country and they\u2019re patriotic. But it\u2019s not the patriotism that you\u2019re seeing in the commercials as you watch television these days. Their patriotism is not only a pride in the country as it is, but a pride in this country that is strong enough to meet the challenges of the future. Do you know when we find jobs for the eight and a half million people who are unemployed in this country, you know we\u2019ll make our economy stronger and that will be a patriotic act. When we reduce the deficits and we cut interest rates, and I know the president doesn\u2019t believe that, but it\u2019s so \u2013 we cut those interest rates young people can buy houses, that\u2019s pro-family and that will be a patriotic act. When we educate our children \u2013 good Lord, they\u2019re going to be able to compete in a world economy and that makes us stronger and that\u2019s a patriotic act. When we stop the arms race, we make this a safer, saner world, and that\u2019s a patriotic act, and when we keep the peace young men don\u2019t die, and that\u2019s a patriotic act. Those are the keys to the future and who can be the leader for the future? When Walter Mondale was attorney general of Minnesota, he led the fight for a man who could not afford to get justice because he couldn\u2019t afford a lawyer; when he was in the Senate he fought for child nutrition programs, he wrote the Fair Housing Act, he even investigated the concerns and the abuses of migrant workers. And why did he do that? Those weren\u2019t popular causes. You know, no one had ever heard of Clarence Gideon, the man without a lawyer. Children don\u2019t vote and migrant workers exactly a powerful lobby in this country, but he did it because it was right. Fritz Mondale has said that he would rather lose a battle for decency than win one over self-interest. Now I agree with him. This campaign is not over. For our country, for our future, for the principles we believe in Walter Mondale and I have just begun to fight."}

Our objectives ought to be to strengthen the democracies, to stop Communist and other extremist influences, and stabilize the community in that area. To do that we need a three-pronged attack: one is military assistance to our friends who are being pressured; secondly, a strong and sophisticated economic aid program and human rights program that offers a better life and a sharper alternative to the alternative offered by the totalitarians who oppose us; and finally, a strong diplomatic effort that pursues the possibilities of peace in the area. That\u2019s one of the big disagreements that we have with the President \u2014 that they have not pursued the diplomatic opportunities either within El Salvador or as between the countries and have lost time during which we might have been able to achieve a peace This brings up the whole question of what Presidential leadership is all about. I think the lesson in Central America, this recent embarrassment in Nicaragua where we are giving instructions for hired assassins, hiring criminals, and the rest \u2014 all of this has strengthened our opponents. A President must not only assure that we\u2019re tough, but we must also be wise and smart in the exercise of that power. We saw the same thing in Lebanon, where we spent a good deal of America\u2019s assets. But because the leadership of this government did not pursue wise policies, we have been humiliated, and our opponents are stronger. The bottom line of national strength is that the President must be in command, he must lead. And when a President doesn\u2019t know that submarine missiles are recallable, says that 70 percent of our strategic forces are conventional, discovers 3 years into his administration that our arms control efforts have failed because he didn\u2019t know that most Soviet missiles were on land \u2014 these are things a President must know to command.

That\u2019s why I object to the covert action in Nicaragua. That\u2019s a classic example of a strategy that\u2019s embarrassed us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our people and our country in the region.

I know that the CIA is already going forward with one. We have a gentleman down in Nicaragua who is on contract to the CIA, advising \u2014 supposedly on military tactics \u2014 the contras. And he drew up this manual. It was turned over to the agency head of the CIA in Nicaragua to be printed. And a number of pages were excised by that agency head there, the man in charge, and he sent it on up here to CIA, where more pages were excised before it was printed. But some way or other, there were 12 of the original copies that got out down there and were not submitted for this printing process by the CIA. Now, those are the details as we have them. And as soon as we have an investigation and find out where any blame lies for the few that did not get excised or changed, we certainly are going to do something about that. We\u2019ll take the proper action at the proper time. I was very interested to hear about Central America and our process down there, and I thought for a moment that instead of a debate I was going to find Mr. Mondale in complete agreement with what we\u2019re doing, because the plan that he has outlined is the one we\u2019ve been following for quite some time, including diplomatic processes throughout Central America and working closely with the Contadora group. So, I can only tell you about the manual \u2014 that we\u2019re not in the habit of assigning guilt before there has been proper evidence produced and proof of that guilt. But if guilt is established, whoever is guilty we will treat with that situation then, and they will be removed."}

I never, ever conceived of such a thing. I never said any such thing. In a discussion of our strategic arms negotiations, I said that submarines carrying missiles and airplanes carrying missiles were more conventional-type weapons, not as destabilizing as the land-based missiles, and that they were also weapons that \u2014 or carriers \u2014 that if they were sent out and there was a change, you could call them back before they had launched their missiles. But I hope that from here on you will no longer be saying that particular thing, which is absolutely false.

And we\u2019re not going to change their system, and they sure better not try to change ours. But between us, we can either destroy the world or we can save it. And I suggested that, certainly, it was to their common interest, along with ours, to avoid a conflict and to attempt to save the world and remove the nuclear weapons. And I think that perhaps we established a little better understanding. I think that in dealing with the Soviet Union one has to be realistic. I know that Mr. Mondale, in the past, has made statements as if they were just people like ourselves, and if we were kind and good and did something nice, they would respond accordingly. And the result was unilateral disarmament. We canceled the B \u2013 1 under the previous administration. What did we get for it? Nothing. The Soviet Union has been engaged in the biggest military buildup in the history of man at the same time that we tried the policy of unilateral disarmament, of weakness, if you will. And now we are putting up a defense of our own. And I\u2019ve made it very plain to them, we seek no superiority. We simply are going to provide a deterrent so that it will be too costly for them if they are nursing any ideas of aggression against us. Now, they claim they\u2019re not.

I have no illusions about the Soviet Union leadership or the nature of that state. They are a tough and a ruthless adversary, and we must be prepared to meet that challenge, and I would. Where I part with the President is that despite all of those differences we must, as past Presidents before this one have done, meet on the common ground of survival. And that\u2019s where the President has opposed practically every arms control agreement, by every President, of both political parties, since the bomb went off. And he now completes this term with no progress toward arms control at all, but with a very dangerous arms race underway instead. There are now over 2,000 more warheads pointed at us today than there were when he was sworn in, and that does not strengthen us. We must be very, very realistic in the nature of that leadership, but we must grind away and talk to find ways of reducing these differences, particularly where arms races are concerned and other dangerous exercises of Soviet power. There will be no unilateral disarmament under my administration. I will keep this nation strong. I understand exactly what the Soviets are up to, but that, too, is a part of national strength. To do that, a President must know what is essential to command and to leadership and to strength. And that\u2019s where the President\u2019s failure to master, in my opinion, the essential elements of arms control has cost us dearly. He\u2019s 3 years into this administration. He said he just discovered that most Soviet missiles are on land, and that\u2019s why his proposal didn\u2019t work. I invite the American people tomorrow \u2014 because I will issue the statement quoting President Reagan \u2014 he said exactly what I said he said.

And it was because they did not think through how power should be exercised, did not have the American public with them on a plan that worked, that we ended up the way we did. Similarly, in Central America - What we\u2019re doing in Nicaragua with this covert war \u2014 which the Congress, including many Republicans, have tried to stop \u2014 is finally end up with a public definition of American power that hurts us, where we get associated with political assassins and the rest.

First of all, when we and our allies \u2014 the Italians, the French, and the United Kingdom \u2014 went into Lebanon, we went in there at the request of what was left of the Lebanese Government to be a stabilizing force while they tried to establish a government. But the first \u2014 pardon me \u2014 the first time we went in, we went in at their request because the war was going on right in Beirut between Israel and the PLO terrorists. Israel could not be blamed for that. Those terrorists had been violating their northern border consistently, and Israel chased them all the way to there. Then we went in with the multinational force to help remove, and did remove, more than 13,000 of those terrorists from Lebanon. We departed. And then the Government of Lebanon asked us back in as a stabilizing force while they established a government and sought to get the foreign forces all the way out of Lebanon and that they could then take care of their own borders. And we were succeeding. We were there for the better part of a year. Our position happened to be at the airport. Oh, there were occasional snipings and sometimes some artillery fire, but we did not engage in conflict that was out of line with our mission. I will never send troops anywhere on a mission of that kind without telling them that if somebody shoots at them, they can darn well shoot back. And this is what we did. We never initiated any kind of action; we defended ourselves there. But we were succeeding to the point that the Lebanese Government had been organized \u2014 if you will remember, there were the meetings in Geneva in which they began to meet with the hostile factional forces and try to put together some kind of a peace plan. We were succeeding, and that was why the terrorist acts began. There are forces there \u2014 and that includes Syria, in my mind \u2014 who don\u2019t want us to succeed, who don\u2019t want that kind of a peace with a dominant Lebanon, dominant over its own territory. And so, the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing of the building. Then the multilateral force withdrew for only one reason: We withdrew because we were no longer able to carry out the mission for which we had been sent in. But we went in in the interest of peace and to keep Israel and Syria from getting into the sixth war between them. And I have no apologies for our going on a peace mission."}

Mr. President, I\u2019d like to head for the fence and try to catch that one before it goes over, but I\u2019ll go on to another question. You and Mr. Mondale have already disagreed about what you had to say about recalling submarine-launched missiles. There\u2019s another, a similar issue out there that relates to your \u2014 it is said, at least, that you were unaware that the Soviet retaliatory power was based on land-based missiles. First, is that correct? Secondly, if it is correct, have you informed yourself in the meantime? And third, is it even necessary for the President to be so intimately involved in strategic details? Yes, this had to do with our disarmament talks. And the whole controversy about land missiles came up because we thought that the strategic nuclear weapons, the most destabilizing are the land-based. You put your thumb on a button and somebody blows up 20 minutes later. So, we thought that it would be simpler to negotiate first with those. And then we made it plain, a second phase, take up the submarine-launched or the airborne missiles. The Soviet Union, to our surprise \u2014 and not just mine \u2014 made it plain when we brought this up that they placed, they thought, a greater reliance on the land-based missiles and, therefore, they wanted to take up all three. And we agreed. We said, \u201cAll right, if that\u2019s what you want to do.\u201d But it was a surprise to us, because they outnumbered us 64 to 36 in submarines and 20 percent more bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles than we had. So, why should we believe that they had placed that much more reliance on land-based? But even after we gave in and said, \u201cAll right, let\u2019s discuss it all,\u201d they walked away from the table. We didn\u2019t. The President\u2019s Age Mr. Trewhitt.

What\u2019s at issue here is the President\u2019s application of his authority to understand what a President must know to lead this nation, secure our defense, and make the decisions and the judgments that are necessary. A minute ago the President quoted Cicero, I believe. I want to quote somebody a little closer to home, Harry Truman. He said, \u201cThe buck stops here.\u201d We just heard the President\u2019s answer for the problems at the barracks in Lebanon, where 241 marines were killed. What happened? First, the Joint Chiefs of Staff went to the President, said, \u201cDon\u2019t put those troops there.\u201d They did it. And then 5 days before the troops were killed, they went back to the President, through the Secretary of Defense, and said, \u201cPlease, Mr. President, take those troops out of there because we can\u2019t defend them.\u201d They didn\u2019t do it. And we know what happened. After that, once again, our Embassy was exploded. This is the fourth time this has happened \u2014 an identical attack, in the same region, despite warnings \u2014 even public warnings \u2014 from the terrorists. Who\u2019s in charge? Who\u2019s handling this matter? That\u2019s my main point. Now, on arms control, we\u2019re completing 4 years. This is the first administration since the bomb went off that made no progress. We have an arms race underway instead. A President has to lead his government or it won\u2019t be done. Different people with different views fight with each other. For 3\\1\/2\\ years, this administration avoided arms control, resisted tabling arms control proposals that had any hope of agreeing, rebuked their negotiator in 1981 when he came close to an agreement, at least in principle, on medium-range weapons. And we have this arms race underway. And a recent book that just came out by perhaps the Nation\u2019s most respected author in this field, Strobe Talbott, called \u201cDeadly Gambits,\u201d concludes that this President has failed to master the essential details needed to command and lead us, both in terms of security and terms of arms control. That\u2019s why they call the President the Commander in Chief. Good intentions, I grant. But it takes more than that. You must be tough and smart. The President\u2019s Leadership Mr. Trewhitt. This question of leadership keeps arising in different forms in this discussion already. And the President, Mr. Mondale, has called you whining and vacillating, among the more charitable phrases \u2014 weak, I believe. It is a question of leadership. And he has made the point that you have not repudiated some of the semidiplomatic activity of the Reverend Jackson, particularly in Central America. Did you approve of his diplomatic activity?

Che Guevara was a contemptible figure in civilization\u2019s history. I know the Cuban state as a police state, and all my life I\u2019ve worked in a way that demonstrates that.

In the last debate,\\1\\ (FOOTNOTE) the Vice President of the United States said that I said the marines had died shamefully and died in shame in Lebanon. I demanded an apology from Vice President Bush because I had, instead, honored these young men, grieved for their families, and think they were wonderful Americans that honored us all. What does the President have to say about taking responsibility for a Vice President who won\u2019t apologize for something like that?

And, as a matter of fact, we haven\u2019t avoided arms control talks with the Soviet Union. Very early in my administration I proposed \u2014 and I think something that had never been proposed by any previous administration \u2014 I proposed a total elimination of intermediate-range missiles, where the Soviets had better than a 10 \u2014 and still have \u2014 better than a 10-to-1 advantage over the allies in Europe. When they protested that and suggested a smaller number, perhaps, I went along with that. The so-called negotiation that you said I walked out on was the so-called walk in the woods between one of our representatives and one of the Soviet Union, and it wasn\u2019t me that turned it down, the Soviet Union disavowed it."}

MONDALE","Text":"This is a very serious problem in our country, and it has to be dealt with. I object to that part of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill which I think is very unfair and would prove to be so. That is the part that requires employers to determine the citizenship of an employee before they\u2019re hired. I\u2019m convinced that the result of this would be that people who are Hispanic, people who have different languages or speak with an accent, would find it difficult to be employed. I think that\u2019s wrong. We\u2019ve never had citizenship tests in our country before, and I don\u2019t think we should have a citizenship card today. That is counterproductive. I do support the other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill that strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen other ways of dealing with undocumented workers in this difficult area and dealing with the problem of settling people who have lived here for many, many years and do not have an established status. I have further strongly recommended that this administration do something it has not done, and that is to strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen the officials in this government that deal with undocumented workers, and to do so in a way that\u2019s responsible and within the Constitution of the United States. We need an answer to this problem, but it must be an American answer that is consistent with justice and due process. Everyone in this room, practically, here tonight, is an immigrant. We came here loving this nation, serving it, and it has served all of our most bountiful dreams. And one of those dreams is justice. And we need a measure \u2014 and I will support a measure \u2014 that brings about those objectives but avoids that one aspect that I think is very serious. The second part is to maintain and improve relations with our friends to the south. We cannot solve this problem all on our own. And that\u2019s why the failure of this administration to deal in an effective and a good-faith way with Mexico, with Costa Rica, with the other nations in trying to find a peaceful settlement to the dispute in Central America has undermined our capacity to effectively deal diplomatically in this area as well."}

I\u2019m doing it because all my life I\u2019ve fought for a system of justice in this country, a system in which every American has a chance to achieve the fullness in life without discrimination. This bill imposes upon employers the responsibility of determining whether somebody who applies for a job is an American or not. And just inevitably, they\u2019re going to be reluctant to hire Hispanics or people with a different accent. If I were dealing with politics here, the polls show the American people want this. I am for reform in this area, for tough enforcement at the border, and for many other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, but all my life I\u2019ve fought for a fair nation. And despite the politics of it, I stand where I stand, and I think I\u2019m right, and before this fight is over we\u2019re going to come up with a better bill, a more effective bill that does not undermine the liberties of our people."}

However, there were things added in in the House side that we felt made it less of a good bill; as a matter of fact, made it a bad bill. And in conference \u2014 we stayed with them in conference all the way to where even Senator Simpson did not want the bill in the manner in which it would come out of the conference committee. There were a number of things in there that weakened that bill. I can\u2019t go into detail about them here. But it is true our borders are out of control. It is also true that this has been a situation on our borders back through a number of administrations. And I supported this bill. I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though sometime back they may have entered illegally. With regard to the employer sanctions, we must have that not only to ensure that we can identify the illegal aliens, but also, while some keep protesting about what it would do to employers, there is another employer that we shouldn\u2019t be so concerned about, and these are employers down through the years who have encouraged the illegal entry into this country because they then hire these individuals and hire them at starvation wages and with none of the benefits that we think are normal and natural for workers in our country, and the individuals can\u2019t complain because of their illegal status. We don\u2019t think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free. And this was why the provisions that we had in with regard to sanctions, and so forth \u2014 and I\u2019m going to do everything I can, and all of us in the administration are, to join in again when Congress is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us, once again, control of our borders. And with regard to friendship below the border and with the countries down there, yes, no administration that I know has established the relationship that we have with our Latin friends. But as long as they have an economy that leaves so many people in dire poverty and unemployment, they are going to seek that employment across our borders. And we work with those other countries."}

It\u2019s almost like going back to the Malthusian theory, when even then they were saying that everyone would starve with the limited population they had then. But the problem of population growth is one, here, with regard to our immigration. And we have been the safety valve, whether we wanted to or not, with the illegal entry here, in Mexico, where their population is increasing and they don\u2019t have an economy that can absorb them and provide the jobs.

And that\u2019s why this enormous national debt, engineered by this administration, is harming these countries in fueling this immigration. These high interest rates \u2014 real rates that have doubled under this administration \u2014 have had the same effect on Mexico and so on, and the cost of repaying those debts is so enormous that it results in massive unemployment, hardship, and heartache.

RIDINGS","Speaker":"THE PRESIDENT","Text":"Mr. Kalb, I think what has been hailed as something I\u2019m supposedly, as President, discussing as principle is the recall of just some philosophical discussions with people who are interested in the same things; and that is the prophecies down through the years, the biblical prophecies of what would portend the coming of Armageddon, and so forth, and the fact that a number of theologians for the last decade or more have believed that this was true, that the prophecies are coming together that portend that. But no one knows whether Armageddon, those prophecies mean that Armageddon is a thousand years away or day after tomorrow. So, I have never seriously warned and said we must plan according to Armageddon. Now, with regard to having to say whether we would try to survive in the event of a nuclear war, of course we would. But let me also point out that to several parliaments around the world, in Europe and in Asia, I have made a statement to each one of them, and I\u2019ll repeat it here: A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. And that is why we are maintaining a deterrent and trying to achieve a deterrent capacity to where no one would believe that they could start such a war and escape with limited damage. But the deterrent \u2014 and that\u2019s what it is for \u2014 is also what led me to propose what is now being called the Star Wars concept, but propose that we research to see if there isn\u2019t a defensive weapon that could defend against incoming missiles. And if such a defense could be found, wouldn\u2019t it be far more humanitarian to say that now we can defend against a nuclear war by destroying missiles instead of slaughtering millions of people?

MONDALE","Text":"First of all, let me sharply disagree with the President on sharing the most advanced, the most dangerous, the most important technology in America with the Soviet Union. We have had for many years, understandably, a system of restraints on high technology because the Soviets are behind us. And any research or development along the Star Wars schemes would inevitably involve our most advanced computers, our most advanced engineering. And the thought that we would share this with the Soviet Union is, in my opinion, a total non-STARTer. I would not let the Soviet Union get their hands on it at all. Now, what\u2019s wrong with Star Wars? There\u2019s nothing wrong with the theory of it. If we could develop a principle that would say both sides could fire all their missiles and no one would get hurt, I suppose it\u2019s a good idea. But the fact of it is we\u2019re so far away from research that even comes close to that, that the Director of Engineering Research at the Defense Department said to get there we would have to solve eight problems, each of which are more difficult than the atomic bomb and the Manhattan project. It would cost something like a trillion dollars to test and deploy weapons. The second thing is this all assumes that the Soviets wouldn\u2019t respond in kind. And they always do. We don\u2019t get behind. They won\u2019t get behind. And that\u2019s been the tragic story of the arms race. We have more at stake in space satellites than they do. If we could stop, right now, the testing and the deployment of these space weapons \u2014 and the President\u2019s proposals go clear beyond research; if it was just research we wouldn\u2019t have any argument, because maybe someday, somebody will think of something \u2014 but to commit this nation to a buildup of antisatellite and space weapons at this time, in their crude state, would bring about an arms race that\u2019s very dangerous indeed. One final point. The most dangerous aspect of this proposal is, for the first time, we would delegate to computers the decision as to whether to start a war. That\u2019s dead wrong. There wouldn\u2019t be time for a President to decide; it would be decided by these remote computers. It might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer might decide it\u2019s a missile \u2014 and off we go. Why don\u2019t we stop this madness now and draw a line and keep the heavens free from war?  Nuclear Freeze"}

Now, why do I support the freeze? Because this ever-rising arms race madness makes both nations less secure. It\u2019s more difficult to defend this nation. It\u2019s putting a hair-trigger on nuclear war. This administration, by going into the Star Wars system, is going to add a dangerous new escalation.

If they\u2019re antisatellite weapons, I assume they\u2019re going to be aimed against satellites. Now, this is the most dangerous technology that we possess. The Soviets try to spy on us, steal this stuff. And to give them technology of this kind, I disagree with. You haven\u2019t just accepted research, Mr. President. You\u2019ve set up a Strategic Defense Initiative, an agency, you\u2019re beginning to test, you\u2019re talking about deploying, you\u2019re asking for a budget of some $30 billion for this purpose. This is an arms escalation. And we will be better off, far better off, if we stop right now, because we have more to lose in space then they do. If someday, somebody comes along with an answer, that\u2019s something else. But that there would be an answer in our lifetime is unimaginable.

And I support the air launch cruise missile, the ground launch cruise missile, the Pershing missile, the Trident submarine, the D \u2013 5 submarine, Stealth technology, the Midgetman \u2014 we have a whole range of technology. Why I disagree with the MX is that it\u2019s a sitting duck. It\u2019ll draw an attack. It puts a hair-trigger, and it is a dangerous, destabilizing weapon. And the B \u2013 1 is similarly to be opposed, because for 15 years the Soviet Union has been preparing to meet the B \u2013 1. The Secretary of Defense himself said it would be a suicide mission if it were built. Instead, I want to build the Midgetman, which is mobile and thus less vulnerable, contributing to stability, and a weapon that will give us security and contribute to an incentive for arms control. That\u2019s why I\u2019m for Stealth technology, to build a Stealth bomber \u2014 which I\u2019ve supported for years \u2014 that can penetrate the Soviet air defense system without any hope that they can perceive where it is because their radar system is frustrated. In other words, a President has to make choices. This makes us stronger. The final point is that we can use this money that we save on these weapons to spend on things that we really need. Our conventional strength in Europe is under strength. We need to strengthen that in order to assure our Western allies of our presence there, a strong defense, but also to diminish and reduce the likelihood of a commencement of a war and the use of nuclear weapons. It\u2019s in this way, by making wise choices, that we\u2019re stronger, we enhance the chances of arms control.

And I am not at all convinced that he was that far out of line with his people or that they wanted that to happen. The Shah had done our bidding and carried our load in the Middle East for quite some time, and I did think that it was a blot on our record that we let him down. Have things gotten better? The Shah, whatever he might have done, was building low-cost housing, had taken land away from the Mullahs and was distributing it to the peasants so they could be landowners \u2014 things of that kind. But we turned it over to a maniacal fanatic who has slaughtered thousands and thousands of people, calling it executions. The matter of Somoza \u2014 no, I never defended Somoza. And, as a matter of fact, the previous administration stood by and so did I \u2014 not that I could have done anything in my position at that time \u2014 but for this revolution to take place. And the promise of the revolution was democracy, human rights, free labor unions, free press. And then, just as Castro had done in Cuba, the Sandinistas ousted the other parties to the revolution. Many of them are now the contras. They exiled some, they jailed some, they murdered some. And they installed a Marxist-Leninist totalitarian government. And what I have to say about this is, many times \u2014 and this has to do with the Philippines, also, I know there are things there in the Philippines that do not look good to us from the standpoint right now of democratic rights, but what is the alternative? It is a large Communist movement to take over the Philippines. They have been our friend since their inception as a nation. And I think that we\u2019ve had enough of a record of letting \u2014 under the guise of revolution \u2014 someone that we thought was a little more right than we would be, letting that person go, and then winding up with totalitarianism, pure and simple, as the alternative.

And it seems to me that this could be an adjunct, or certainly a great assisting agent in getting that done. I am not going to roll over, as Mr. Mondale suggests, and give them something that could turn around and be used against us. But I think it\u2019s a very interesting proposal, to see if we can find, first of all, something that renders those weapons obsolete, incapable of their mission. But Mr. Mondale seems to approve MAD \u2014 MAD is mutual assured destruction \u2014 meaning, if you use nuclear weapons on us, the only thing we have to keep you from doing it is that we\u2019ll kill as many people of yours as you\u2019ll kill of ours. I think that to do everything we can to find, as I say, something that would destroy weapons and not humans is a great step forward in human rights. Mr. Trewhitt. Mr. Mondale, could I ask you to address the question of nuclear strategy then? The formal doctrine is very arcane, but I\u2019m going to ask you to deal with it anyway. Do you believe in MAD, mutual assured destruction, mutual deterrence as it has been practiced for the last generation?"}

And in the meantime, we have to be strong enough to make certain that the Soviet Union never tempts us. Now, here we have to decide between generalized objectives and reality. The President says he wants to eliminate or reduce the number of nuclear weapons. But, in fact, these last 4 years have seen more weapons built, a wider and more vigorous arms race than in human history. He says he wants a system that will make nuclear wars safe, so nobody\u2019s going to get hurt. Well, maybe someday, somebody can dream of that. But why start an arms race now? Why destabilize our relationship? Why threaten our space satellites upon which we depend? Why pursue a strategy that would delegate to computers the question of starting a war? A President, to defend this country and to get arms control, must master what\u2019s going on. I accept his objective and his dream; we all do. But the hard reality is that we must know what we\u2019re doing and pursue those objectives that are possible in our time. He\u2019s opposed every effort of every President to do so, and in the 4 years of his administration he\u2019s failed to do so. And if you want a tough President who uses that strength to get arms control and draws the line in the heavens, vote for Walter Mondale. "}

MONDALE","Text":"I want to thank the League of Women Voters, the good citizens of Kansas City, and President Reagan for agreeing to debate this evening. This evening we talked about national strength. I believe we need to be strong, and I will keep us strong. But I think strength must also require wisdom and smarts in its exercise. That\u2019s key to the strength of our nation. A President must know the essential facts essential to command. But a President must also have a vision of where this nation should go. Tonight, as Americans, you have a choice. And you\u2019re entitled to know where we would take this country if you decide to elect us. As President, I would press for long-term, vigorous economic growth. That\u2019s why I want to get these debts down and these interest rates down, restore America\u2019s exports, help rural America, which is suffering so much, and bring the jobs back here for our children. I want this next generation to be the best educated in American history, to invest in the human mind and science again, so we\u2019re out front. I want this nation to protect its air, its water, its land, and its public health. America is not temporary; we\u2019re forever. And as Americans, our generation should protect this wonderful land for our children. I want a nation of fairness, where no one is denied the fullness of life or discriminated against, and we deal compassionately with those in our midst who are in trouble. And, above all, I want a nation that\u2019s strong. Since we debated 2 weeks ago, the United States and the Soviet Union have built a hundred more warheads, enough to kill millions of Americans and millions of Soviet citizens. This doesn\u2019t strengthen us. This weakens the chances of civilization to survive. I remember the night before I became Vice President. I was given the briefing and told that any time, night or day, I might be called upon to make the most fateful decision on Earth \u2014 whether to fire these atomic weapons that could destroy the human species. That lesson tells us two things: One, pick a President that you know will know if that tragic moment ever comes what he must know, because there\u2019ll be no time for staffing committees or advisers. A President must know right then. But above all, pick a President who will fight to avoid the day when that God-awful decision ever needs to be made. And that\u2019s why this election is so terribly important. America and Americans decide not just what\u2019s happening in this country. We are the strongest and most powerful free society on Earth. When you make that judgment, you are deciding not only the future of our nation; in a very profound respect, you\u2019re deciding the future of the world. We need to move on. It\u2019s time for America to find new leadership. Please, join me in this cause to move confidently and with a sense of assurance and command to build the blessed future of our nation."}

RIDINGS","Speaker":"THE PRESIDENT","Text":"Yes. My thanks to the League of Women Voters, to the panelists, the moderator, and to the people of Kansas City for their warm hospitality and greeting. I think the American people tonight have much to be grateful for \u2014 an economic recovery that has become expansion, freedom and, most of all, we are at peace. I am grateful for the chance to reaffirm my commitment to reduce nuclear weapons and, one day, to eliminate them entirely. The question before you comes down to this - Do you want to see America return to the policies of weakness of the last 4 years? Or do we want to go forward, marching together, as a nation of strength and that\u2019s going to continue to be strong? We shouldn\u2019t be dwelling on the past, or even the present. The meaning of this election is the future and whether we\u2019re going to grow and provide the jobs and the opportunities for all Americans and that they need. Several years ago, I was given an assignment to write a letter. It was to go into a time capsule and would be read in 100 years when that time capsule was opened. I remember driving down the California coast one day. My mind was full of what I was going to put in that letter about the problems and the issues that confront us in our time and what we did about them. But I couldn\u2019t completely neglect the beauty around me \u2014 the Pacific out there on one side of the highway, shining in the sunlight, the mountains of the coast range rising on the other side. And I found myself wondering what it would be like for someone \u2014 wondering if someone 100 years from now would be driving down that highway, and if they would see the same thing. And with that thought, I realized what a job I had with that letter. I would be writing a letter to people who know everything there is to know about us. We know nothing about them. They would know all about our problems. They would know how we solved them, and whether our solution was beneficial to them down through the years or whether it hurt them. They would also know that we lived in a world with terrible weapons, nuclear weapons of terrible destructive power, aimed at each other, capable of crossing the ocean in a matter of minutes and destroying civilization as we knew it. And then I thought to myself, what are they going to say about us, what are those people 100 years from now going to think? They will know whether we used those weapons or not. Well, what they will say about us 100 years from now depends on how we keep our rendezvous with destiny. Will we do the things that we know must be done and know that one day, down in history 100 years or perhaps before, someone will say, \u201cThank God for those people back in the 1980\u2019s for preserving our freedom, for saving for us this blessed planet called Earth, with all its grandeur and its beauty.\u201d You know, I am grateful to all of you for giving me the opportunity to serve you for these 4 years, and I seek reelection because I want more than anything else to try to complete the new beginning that we charted 4 years ago. George Bush, who I think is one of the finest Vice Presidents this country has ever had \u2014 George Bush and I have crisscrossed the country, and we\u2019ve had, in these last few months, a wonderful experience. We have met young America. We have met your sons and daughters."}

JOHN B. ANDERSON","Text":"Miss Loomis, I think it\u2019s very appropriate that the first question in this first debate of Campaign \u201980 should relate to the economy of the country, because it seems to me that the people who are watching us tonight \u2013 221 million Americans \u2013 are truly concerned about the poor rate of performance of the American economy over the last four years. Governor Reagan is not responsible for what has happened over the last four years, nor am I. The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend. But I want to answer as specifically as I can the question that you have just put to me. Let me tell you that I, first of all, oppose an election year tax cut, whether it is the 10% across-the-board tax cut promised to the taxpayers by my opponent in this debate tonight, or whether it is the $27.5 billion tax cut promised on the 20th of August by President Carter. I simply think that when we are confronting a budget deficit this year \u2013 and this fiscal year will end in about 10 days, and we are confronted with the possibility of a deficit of $60 billion, perhaps as much as $63 billion \u2013 that that simply would be irresponsible. That, once again, the printing presses will start to roll; once again we will see the monetization of that debt result in a higher rate of inflation. Even though we\u2019ve seen some hopeful signs, perhaps, in the flash report on the third quarter, that perhaps the economy is coming out of the recession, we\u2019ve also seen the rise in the rate of the prime; we have seen mortgage rates back up again, a sure sign of inflation in the housing industry. What I would propose, and I proposed it way back in March when I was a candidate in my own state of Illinois, I proposed $11.3 billion, specifically, in cuts in the Federal budget. I think we\u2019ve got to have fiscal restraint. And I said at that time that one of the things that we could do, that perhaps would save as much as $5 billion to $7 billion, according, to one of the leading members of the House Budget Committee, was to recalculate the index that is used to determine the cost of living benefits that are paid to civil service retirees, to military retirees. That we ought to \u2026 in addition to that, we ought to pay those retirement benefits on the basis of once a year, rather than twice a year, and save $750 billion. In other words\u2026."}

RONALD REAGAN","Text":"I believe that the only unpopular measures, actually, that could be, or would be applied, would be unpopular with the government, and with those. perhaps, some special interest groups who are tied closely to government. I believe that inflation today is caused by government simply spending more than government takes in, at the same time that government has imposed upon business and industry, from the shopkeeper on the corner to the biggest industrial plant in America, countless harassing regulations and punitive taxes that have reduced productivity at the same time they have increased the cost of production. And when you are reducing productivity at the same time that you are turning out printing-press money in excessive amounts, you\u2019re causing inflation. And it isn\u2019t really higher prices, it\u2019s just, you are reducing the value of the money. You are robbing the American people of their savings. And so, the plan that I have proposed \u2013 and contrary to what John says, my plan is for a phased-in tax cut over a three-year period, tax increase and depreciation allowances for business and industry to give them the capital to refurbish plant and equipment, research and development, improved technology \u2013 all of which we see our foreign competitors having, and we have the greatest percentage of outmoded industrial plant and equipment of any of the industrial nations \u2013 produce more, have stable money supply, and give the people of this country a greater share of their own savings. Now, I know that this has been called inflationary by my opponent and by the man who isn\u2019t here tonight. But I don\u2019t see where it is inflationary to have people keep more of their earnings and spend it, and it isn\u2019t inflationary for government to take that money away from them and spend it on the things it wants to spend it on. I believe we need incentive for the individual, and for business and industry, and I believe the plan that I have submitted, with detailed backing, and which has been approved by a number of our leading economists in the country, is based on projections. conservative projections out for the next five years, that indicates that this plan would, by 1983, result in a balanced budget. We have to remember, when we talk a tax cut, we\u2019re only talking about reducing a tax increase, because this Administration has left us with a built-in tax increase that will amount to $86 billion next year."}

MOYERS","Speaker":"ANDERSON","Text":"Mr. Movers, in addition to saying that this is no time for a tax cut, in view of the incipient signs of renewed inflation, in addition to calling for restraint in Federal spending, 15 months ago, I also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline. I say that because I think, this year, we will send $90 billion out of this country to pay for imported oil, even though that. those imports have been reduced. And since I first made that proposal 15 months ago, the price of gasoline, which was then $.80, has gone up to about $1.30. In other words, we\u2019ve had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country \u2013 or much of it \u2013 into the pockets of OPEC oil producers. Whereas I have proposed we ought to take. put that tax on here at home, reduce our consumption of that imported oil. Recycle those proceeds, then, back into the pockets of the American workers by reducing their tax payments. their Social Security tax payments by 50%. That, I think, in addition, would be an anti-inflationary measure that would strengthen the economy of this country."}

MOYERS","Speaker":"REAGAN","Text":"Well, I cannot see where a $.50 a gallon tax applied to gasoline would have changed the price of gasoline. It would still have gone up as much as it has, and the $.50 would be added on top of that. And it would be a tax paid by the consumers, and then we\u2019re asked to believe that some way, they would get this back to the consumers. But why? Why take it in the first place if you\u2019re going to give it back? Why not leave it with them? And John spoke about 15 years ago, on the position that he. or 15 months ago, on what he believed in. Fifteen months ago, he was a cosigner and advocating the very tax cut that I am proposing, and said that that would be a forward step in fighting inflation, and that it would be beneficial to the working people of this country."}

MOYERS","Speaker":"REAGAN","Text":"Well, I believe that conservation, at course, is worthy in and of itself. Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and I\u2019m for it. But I do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the present energy problem, because all you\u2019re doing then is staving off, by a short time, the day when you would come to the end of the energy supply. To say that we are limited, and at a dangerous point in this country with regard to energy, I think, is to ignore the fact. The fact is, that in today\u2019s oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used. But it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground. And this is known oil reserves, known supplies. There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago. We have a coal supply that is equal to 50% of the world\u2019s coal supply, good for centuries, in this country. I grant you that prices may go up, because as you go further and have to go deeper, you are adding to the cost of production. We have nuclear power, which, I believe, with the safest. the most stringent of safety requirements, could meet our energy needs for the next couple of decades while we go forward exploring the areas of solar power and other forms of energy that might be renewable and that would not be exhaustible. All of these things can be done. When you stop and think that we are only drilling on 2%. have leased only 2% of the possible. possibility for oil of the continental shelf around the United States; when you stop to think that the government has taken over 100 million acres of land out of circulation in Alaska, alone, that is believed by geologists to contain much in the line of minerals and energy sources, then I think it is the Government, and the Government with its own restrictions and regulations, that is creating the energy crisis. That we are, indeed, an energy-rich nation."}

MOYERS","Speaker":"ANDERSON","Text":"Well, Mr. Greenberg, I simply cannot allow to go unpassed the statements that have just been made by Mr. Reagan, who once again, has demonstrated, I think, a total misunderstanding of the energy crisis that confronts, not only this country, but the world, when he suggests that we have 27 years\u2019 supply of natural gas, 47 years\u2019 supply of oil, and all the rest, and that we really. all we have to do is to get the Government off the back of the oil industry, and that\u2019s going to be enough. I agree with what I think is the major premise of your question, sir, that we are going to have to create a new conservation ethic in the minds of the American people. and that\u2019s simply why I proposed, 15 months ago, the emergency excise tax on gasoline that I did. I did it as a security measure to be sure, because I would rather see us reduce the consumption of imported oil than have to send American boys to fight in the Persian Gulf. But at the same time, I think it\u2019s going to take a dramatic measure of that kind to convince the American people that we will have to reduce the use of the private automobile. We simply cannot have people sitting one behind the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams going in and out of our great cities. We are going to have to resort to van pooling, to car pooling. We\u2019re going to have to develop better community transportation systems, so that with buses and light rail, we can replace the private automobile in those places where it clearly is not energy-efficient. I think that, with respect to housing, when we are consuming, even though our per capita income today is about the same as that of the Federal Republic of Germany, we are consuming about, by a factor of two, the amount of energy that they consume in that country. Surely, there are things that we can do in the retrofitting, ;n the redesign of our homes, not only of our houses, but of our commercial structures, as well, that will make it possible for us to achieve. According to one study that was published a short time ago \u2013 the Harvard Business School study \u2013 indicated that just in the commercial sector alone of the economy, we could save between 30% and 40% of the energy that we consume in this country today. So I think, yes, we will have to change in a very appreciable way, some of the lifestyles that we now enjoy."}

MOYERS","Speaker":"REAGAN","Text":"Well, as I\u2019ve said, I am not an enemy of conservation. I wouldn\u2019t be called a conservative if I were. But, when my figures are challenged, as the President himself challenged them after I made them, I think it should be called to the attention of John and the others here that my figures are the figures of the Department of Energy, which has not been overly optimistic in recent years as to how much supply we have left. That is the same Government that, in 1920, told us we only had enough oil left for 13 years, and 19 years later, told us we only had enough left for another 15 years. As for saving energy and conserving, the American people haven\u2019t been doing badly at that. Because in industry today, we\u2019re producing more, over the last several years, and at 12% less use of energy than we were back in about 1973. And motorists are using 8% less than they were back at that time of the oil embargo. So, I think we are proving that we can go forward with conservation and benefit from that. But also, I think it is safe to say that we do have sources of energy that have not yet been used or found."}

MOYERS","Speaker":"ANDERSON","Text":"Mr. Greenberg, I think my opponent in this debate tonight is overlooking one other very important fact. And that is, that we cannot look at this as simply a national problem. Even though it\u2019s true that, perhaps, between now and the end of the decade, our total consumption of oil may not increase by more than, perhaps, a million or 2 million barrels of oil a day. The rest of the Western world, we are told, may see its consumption increase from 51 million barrels to about 66 million. And that additional 15 million barrels is going to cause scarcity. It is going to cause scarcity in world markets because there are at least five reputable studies, one even by the American Petroleum Institute itself, that, I think, clearly indicate that somewhere along around the end of the present decade, total world demand for oil is simply going to exceed total available supplies. I think that conservation \u2013 I think that a change in lifestyles \u2013 is necessary, and we had better begin to plan for that now rather than later."}

MOYERS","Speaker":"ANDERSON","Text":"Mr. Corddry, I am well aware of the present deficiencies in the Armed Forces of this country. When you have a report, as we did recently, that six out of 10 CONUS Divisions in this country \u2013 Continental United States Army Divisions \u2013 simply could not pass a readiness test: that two out of three divisions that were to be allocated to the so-called Rapid Deployment Force could not meet a readiness test. And in most cases, that failure to meet the test was because of a lack of manning requirements, an inability to fill many of the slots in those divisions. Yes, I have seen figures that indicate that perhaps as of September, 1980 \u2013 this very month \u2013 that there is a shortage of about 104,000 in the ranks between E-4 and E-9. And there were reports. public reports not long ago about ships that could not leave American ports because of a lack of crews. I talked to one of the leading former chiefs of Naval operations in my office a few weeks ago, who told me about 25,000 Chief Petty Officers being short. But, I think that that is clearly related to the fact that, going back to the time when the all-volunteer Army was created in 1973 \u2013 and I worked hard for it and supported it \u2013 we simply have failed to keep pace with the cost of living. And today, on the average, the average serviceman is at least 15% \u2013 and I happen to think that\u2019s a very modest estimate \u2013 15% below what has happened to the cost of living over that period of time. And as a result, the families of some of our young servicemen are on food stamps today. And I think that\u2019s shocking; it\u2019s shameful. So, yes, I told the American Legion National! Convention, the VFW National Convention \u2013 when I spoke to each of those bodies \u2013 I outlined a very specific program of increasing pay and allowances, reenlistment bonuses. That only makes sense. But I would leave you with this thought, sir, to be quite specific in my answer to your question: that, of course, to protect the vital interests of this country, if that became impossible; if I could not, despite the very best efforts that I asked the Congress to put forward, to raise those pay and incentives and allowances, of course, I would not leave this country go undefended."}

MOYERS","Speaker":"REAGAN","Text":"Mr. Corddry, it\u2019s a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement on this particular issue, and the only one who would be disagreeing with us is the President, if he were present. I. too, believe in the voluntary military. As a matter of fact, today the shortages of non-commissioned officers that John mentioned are such that if we tried to have a draft today, we wouldn\u2019t have the non-commissioned officers to train the draftees. I believe the answer lies in just recognizing human nature and how we make everything else work in this country, when we want it to work. Recognize that we have a voluntary military. We are asking for men and women to join the military as a career, and we\u2019re asking them to deal with the most sophisticated of equipment. And a young man is out there on a $1 billion carrier in charge of the maintenance of a $20 million aircraft, working 100 hours a week at times, and he\u2019s earning less for himself and his family, while he\u2019s away from his family, than he could earn if he were in one of the most menial jobs, working 40 hours a week here at home. As an aid to enlistment. we had an aid \u2013 46% of the people who enlisted in the voluntary military up until 1977 said they did so for one particular reason, the G.I. Bill of Rights \u2013 the fact that, by serving in the military, they could provide for a future college education. In 1977, we took that away from the military. That meant immediately 46% of your people that were signing up had no reason for signing up. So I think it is a case of pay scale, of recognizing that if we\u2019re going to have young men and women responsible for our security, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heaven\u2019s sakes, let\u2019s go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that we\u2019re asking of them. Along with this, I think we need something else that has been allowed to deteriorate. We need a million-man active reserve that could be called up on an instant\u2019s notice, and that would be also trained, ready to use that type of equipment. Both of these, I think, would respond to the proper kind of incentives that we could offer these people. The other day, I just \u2013 I\u2019ll hasten \u2013 I just saw one example. Down in Texas. I saw a high school that is military."}

But, unlike Governor Reagan, I do not support a boondoggle like the MX missile. I\u2019ve just gotten a report from the Air Force that indicates that the 30-year lifecycle cost of that system is going to be $100 billion. The initial cost is about $54 billion, and then when you add in the additional costs \u2013 not only the construction of the system, the missiles and the personnel, and so on \u2013 when you add in the additional costs over the lifecycle of that system, over $100 billion.

But that\u2019s not the $54 billion cost that John is talking about. He\u2019s talking about that fantastic plan of the Administration to take thousands and thousands of square miles out in the Western states. And first, he was going to dig a racetrack and have it going around in the racetrack so it would meet the requirements of SALT II treaty, and now he\u2019s decided it\u2019ll have a straight up and down thing, so it can he both verifiable and yet hideable from the Soviet Union. We need the missile, I think, because we are so out of balance strategically that we lack a deterrent to a possible first assault. But I am not in favor of the plan that is so costly. And therefore, if I only had another second left, I\u2019d say that that high school class in a military training \u2013 40 of its 80 graduates last year entered the United States service academies; West Point, Annapolis and the Air Force Academy, and to see those young men made me very proud to realize that there are young people in this country that are prepared to go into that kind of a career in service of their country."}

MOYERS","Speaker":"REAGAN","Text":"I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have to go against that pledge. I think one of the problems today with the cities is Federal aid. The mayors that I\u2019ve talked to in some of our leading cities tell! me that the Federal grants that come with. for a specific cause or a specific objective, come with such red tape, such priorities established by a bureaucracy in Washington, that the local government\u2019s hands are tied with regard to using that money as they feel could best be used, and for what they think might be the top priority. If they had that money without those government restrictions, every one of them has told me they could make great savings and make far greater use of the money. What I have been advocating is, why don\u2019t we start with the Federal Government turning back tax sources to states and local governments, as well as the responsibilities for those programs? Seventy-five percent of the people live in the cities. I don\u2019t know of a city in America that doesn\u2019t have the kind of problems you\u2019re talking about. But, where are we getting the money that the Federal Government is putting out to help them? New York is being taxed for money that will then go to Detroit. But Detroit is being taxed for money that, let\u2019s say, will go to Chicago, while Chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in Philadelphia. Wouldn\u2019t it make a lot more sense if the government let them keep their own money there in the first place? But there are other things that we can do with the inner cities, and I\u2019ve believed. I have talked of having zones in those cities that are run down, where there is a high percentage of people on welfare, and offer tax incentives. The government isn\u2019t getting a tax now from businesses there because they aren\u2019t there, or from individuals who are on welfare rather than working. And why don\u2019t we offer incentives for business and industry to start up in those zones? Give them a tax moratorium for a period if they build and develop there. The individuals that would then get jobs \u2013 give them a break that encourages them to leave the social welfare programs and go to work. We could have an urban homestead act. We\u2019ve got thousands and thousands of homes owned by government boarded up, being vandalized, that have been taken in mortgage foreclosures. What if we had a homestead act, and said to the people, for $1 we sell you this house. All have to do is agree to refurbish it, make it habitable, and live in it \u2013 just as 100 or more years ago, we did with the open land in this country \u2013 urban . or country homesteading."}

MOYERS","Speaker":"ANDERSON","Text":"Mr. May, I recently saw a Princeton University study that indicated that the cities of America \u2013 the large cities of this country \u2013 are in worse shape today than they were in 1960. It seems to totally belie the claim that I heard President Carter make a few days ago, that he was the first President that had come forth with a real urban strategy to meet the problems of urban America. Incidentally, just this past week, the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen, I guess, because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits. I\u2019m happy to say that, in contrast to that, the Anderson-Lucey platform for America, program for the 80s, has devoted considerable time, and in very specific detail, we have talked about two things that ought to be done to aid urban America. We call, first of all, for the creation of a $4 billion urban reinvestment trust fund to do exactly what you spoke about in your question \u2013 to rebuild the streets, to rebuild the cities, the leaking water mains. I was in North Pittsburgh \u2013 I think it was a few weeks ago, on my campaign \u2013 the water mains in that city had begun to leak, and literally, there wasn\u2019t money available to fix them. And until we can begin to recreate the basic infrastructure of the great cities of America, particularly in the upper Midwest and in the Northeast, they simply are not going to provide the kind of economic climate that will enable them to retain industry, enable them to retain the kind of solid industrial base that they need, so that they can provide jobs. We have also provided in our program for a $4 billion Community Trust Fund, and we\u2019ve told you where the money is coming from. It\u2019s going to come from the dedication, by 1984, of the excise revenues that today are being collected by the Federal Government on alcohol and tobacco. That money, I think, ought to be put into rebuilding the base of our cities. In addition to that, jobs programs to re-employ the youth in our cities would be very high on my priority list, both the Youth Opportunities Act of 1980 and a billion-dollar program that I would recommend to put youth to work in energy projects, in conservation projects, in projects that would carry out some of the great national goals of our country."}

MOYERS","Speaker":"REAGAN","Text":"Yes. Government claims. John claims that he is making plain where the money will come from. It will come from the pockets of the people. It will come from the pockets of the people who are living in those very areas. And the problem is, with Governments \u2013 Federal, State and Local \u2013 taking $.44 out of every dollar earned, that the Federal Government has pre-empted too many of the tax sources, and that the cities. if Pittsburgh does not have the money to fix the leaking water mains, it\u2019s because the Federal Government has pre-empted. Now, the Federal Government is going to turn around and say, well you have this problem; we will now hand you the money to do it. But the Federal Government doesn\u2019t make money. It just takes \u2013 from the people. And in my view, this is not the answer to the problem. Stand in the South Bronx as I did, in the spot where Jimmy Carter made his promise that he was going to, with multi-billion dollar programs, refurbish that area that looks like bombed-out London in World War II. I stood there, and I met the people. And I heard them ask just for something that would give them hope. And I believe that, while all of the promises have been broken, they\u2019ve never been carried out. But I believe that my plan might offer an opportunity for that, if we would move into those areas and let, encourage \u2013 with the tax incentive \u2013 the private sector, to develop and to create the jobs for the people."}

MOYERS","Speaker":"ANDERSON","Text":"Well, of course, where has the private sector been, Governor Reagan, during the years that our cities have been deteriorating? It seems to me that to deny the responsibility of the Federal Government to do something about our crumbling cities is to deny the opportunity for one thing: To 55% of the black population of our country that is locked within the inner cities of the metropolitan areas of our country. We simply cannot ignore the fact that, in those cities today, we have 55% youth unemployment among black and Hispanic youth. And why is that? It\u2019s because they have lost their industry. And why have they lost their industry? It\u2019s because they no longer present the kind of viable economic climate that makes it possible for industry to remain there, or to locate there. I think Government has a responsibility to find jobs for the youth of this country, and that the place to start is to assist in the very important and necessary task of helping cities rebuild."}

MOYERS","Speaker":"ANDERSON","Text":"Miss Quinn, I would be very happy to accept the challenge of your question tonight, to tell the voters of this country exactly what I think it\u2019s going to cost, because I believe that all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver. When these Presidential Debates were held just four years ago, I remember the incumbent President, who was willing to debate, President Ford, telling the American people that they simply ought not to vote for somebody who promised more than they could deliver. Well, we\u2019ve seen what has happened. We haven\u2019t gotten either the economies in Government that were promised; we haven\u2019t gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carter\u2019s first term. Instead we had, I think, in the second quarter, a Consumer Price Index registering around 12%. And nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the Wholesale Price Index \u2013 that\u2019s about 18% on an annualized basis \u2013 what it\u2019s going to be. Let me say this. I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan. His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information. He went so far as to call it \u201cbrutal economics.\u201d I\u2019ve been very careful \u2013 I have been very careful in saying that what I\u2019m going to do is to bring Federal spending under control first. I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done. But, you know, it\u2019s gotten to be about $122 difference. Somebody worked it out. And they figured out that between the tax cut that Governor Reagan is promising the American people, and the tax cut that Jimmy Carter is promising in 198I, his is worth about $122 more. So you, dear voters, are out there on the auction block, and these two candidates are bidding for your votes. And one is going to give you $122 more if you happen to be in that range of about a $20,000-a-year income. I\u2019m going to wait until I see that that inflation rate is going down, before I even begin to phase in the business tax cuts that I\u2019ve talked about. But I think, by improving productivity, they would be far less inflationary than the consumption-oriented tax cut that Governor Reagan is recommending."}

MOYERS","Speaker":"REAGAN","Text":"Miss Quinn, I don\u2019t have to. I\u2019ve done it. We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures. And we used \u2013 yes, we used \u2013 the Senate Budget Committee\u2019s projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5% \u2013 which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated. And eliminated probably more quickly than our plan, but we wanted to be so conservative with it, that people would see how. how well it could be done. Now, John\u2019s been in the Congress for 20 years. And John tells us that first, we\u2019ve got to reduce spending before we can reduce taxes. Well, if you\u2019ve got a kid that\u2019s extravagant, you can lecture him all you want to about his extravagance. Or you can cut his allowance and achieve the same end much quicker. But Government has never reduced Government does not tax to get the money it needs. Government always needs the money it gets. And when John talks about his non-inflationary plan, as far as I have been able to learn, there are 88 proposals in it that call for additional Government spending programs. Now, I speak with some confidence of our plan, because I took over a state \u2013 California \u2013 10% of the population of this nation \u2013 a state that, if it were a nation, would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world. And that state we controlled spending. We cut the rate of increase in spending in half. But at the same time, we gave back to the people of California \u2013 in tax rebates, tax credits, tax cuts \u2013 $5.7 billion. I vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned. And among those vetoes, I stopped $16 billion in additional spending. And the funny thing was that California, which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment, for those six years for the first time, was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment. We have considered inflation in our figures. We deliberately took figures that we, ourselves, believed were too conservative. I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983, and it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s counting on for his plan. But he\u2019s going to get a half-a-trillion dollars more over the next five years that he can use for additional programs, or hopefully, someplace down the line, balancing the budget. We believe that that\u2019s too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people."}

But I do know that, despite his pledge to reduce state Government spending, that it rose from $4.6 billion when he took office in 1967, to $10.2 billion during his eight years in office. Spending, in other words. more than doubled, and it rose at a faster rate than spending was rising in the Federal Government. But on his very optimistic figures about his tax cut producing a balanced budget by 1983, and the fact that he is using, he says, the figures of the Senate Budget Committee, that Senate Budget Committee Report does not accommodate all of the Reagan defense plans. It doesn\u2019t accommodate the expenditures that he calls for, for accelerated development and deployment of a new manned strategic bomber, for a permanent fleet in the Indian Ocean, for the restoration of the fleet to 600 ships, to the development and deployment of a dedicated modern aircraft interceptor. In other words, I have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million a year, just for the military. And I think the figures that he has given are simply not going to stand up."}

But we did factor in our own ideas with regard to increases in the projected military spending that we believe would, over a period of time, do what is necessary. Now also, with regard to the figures about California. The truth of the matter is, we did cut the increase in spending in half. It at the John doesn\u2019t quite realize \u2013 he\u2019s never held an executive position of that kind. And I think being Governor of California is probably the closest thing to the Presidency, if that\u2019s possible, of any executive job in America today \u2013 because it is the most populous state. And I can only tell him that we reduced, in proportion of other states, the per capita spending, the per capita size of Government \u2013 we only increased the size of Government one-twelfth what it had increased in the preceding eight years. And one journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, a respected newspaper, said there was no question about the fact that Governor Reagan had prevented the State of California from going bankrupt."}

MOYERS","Speaker":"REAGAN","Text":"Oh, I\u2019m it\u2019s my question. But whether I agree or disagree with some individual, or what he may say, or how he may say it, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way that we can suggest that because people believe in God and go to church, that they should not want reflected in those people and those causes they support, their own belief in morality, and in the high traditions and principles which we\u2019ve abandoned so much in this country. Going around this country, I think that I have found a great hunger in America for a spiritual revival. For a belief that law must be based on a higher law. For a return to traditions and values that we once had. Our Government, in its most sacred documents \u2013 the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and all \u2013 speak of man being created, of a Creator. That we\u2019re a nation under God. Now, I have thought for a long time that too many of our churches have been too reluctant to speak up in behalf of what they believe is proper in Government, and they have been too too lax in interfering, in recent years, with Government\u2019s invasion of the family itself, putting itself between parent and child. I vetoed a number of bills of that kind myself, when I was in California. Now, whether it is rightful, on a single issue, for anyone to advocate that someone should not be elected or not, I won\u2019t take a position on that. But I do believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to express themselves, or to even try to persuade others to follow their leader. That\u2019s what elections are all about."}

But to try, as occurred in the case that you mentioned \u2013 that specific case \u2013 to try to tell the parishioners of any church, of any denomination, how they should vote, or for whom they should vote, I think violates the principle of separation of church and state. Now, Governor Reagan is running on a platform that calls for a Constitutional amendment banning abortion. I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual. And for the state to interfere with a Constitutional amendment, and tell a woman that she must carry that pregnancy to term, regardless of her personal belief, that, I think, violates freedom of conscience as much as anything that I can think of. And he is also running on a platform that suggests a litmus test for the selection of judges \u2013 that only judges that hold a certain, quote, \u201cview,\u201d on the sanctity of family life, ought to be appointed to the Federal Judiciary, one of the three great independent branches of our Government. No. I believe in freedom of choice. I don\u2019t believe in Constitutional Amendments that would interfere with that. I don\u2019t believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the Federal Judiciary. On the Amendment that you mentioned, I abandoned it 15 years ago. And I have said freely, all over this country, that it was a mistake for me or anyone to ever try to put the Judeo-Christian heritage of this country, important as it is, and important as my religious faith is to me \u2013 it\u2019s a very deeply personal matter. But for me to try, in this very pluralistic society of ours, to try to frame any definition, whatever, of what that belief should be, is wrong. And so, not once, but twice \u2013 in 1971 \u2013 I voted on the floor of the House of Representatives against a Constitutional amendment that tried to bring prayer back into the public schools. I think mother ought to whisper to Johnny and to Susie, as they button their coats in the morning and leave for the classroom, \u201cBe sure to say a prayer before you start your day\u2019s work.\u201d But I don\u2019t think that the state, the Board of Regents, a Board of Education, or any state official, should try to compose that prayer for a child to recite."}

With regard to the freedom of the individual for choice with regard to abortion, there\u2019s one individual who\u2019s not being considered at all. That\u2019s the one who is being aborted. And I\u2019ve noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born. I I think that, technically, I know this is a difficult and an emotional problem, and many people sincerely feel on both sides of this, but I do believe that maybe we could find the answer through medical evidence, if we would determine once and for all, is an unborn child a human being?

And there might be some feeling of unfairness about this because he was not here to respond. But I believe it would have been much more unfair to have had John Anderson denied the right to participate in this debate. And I want to express my appreciation to the League of Women Voters for adopting a course with which I believe the great majority of Americans are in agreement. Now, as to my closing remarks: I\u2019ve always believed that this land was placed here between the two great oceans by some divine plan. That it was placed here to be found by a special kind of people \u2013 people who had a special love for freedom and who had the courage to uproot themselves and leave hearth and homeland, and came to what, in the beginning, was the most undeveloped wilderness possible. We came from 100 different corners of the earth. We spoke a multitude of tongues. We landed on this Eastern shore and then went out over the mountains and the prairies and the deserts and the far western mountains to the Pacific, building cities and towns and farms, and schools and churches. If wind, water or fire destroyed them, we built them again. And in so doing, at the same time, we built a new breed of human called an American \u2013 a proud, an independent., and a most compassionate individual, for the most part. Two hundred years ago, Tom Paine, when the 13 tiny colonies were trying to become a nation, said, we have it in our power to begin the world over again. Today. we\u2019re confronted with the horrendous problems that we\u2019ve discussed here tonight. And some people in high positions of leadership, tell us that the answer is to retreat. That the best is over. That we must cut back. That we must share in an ever-increasing scarcity. That we must, in the failure to be able to protect our national security as it is today, we must not be provocative to any possible adversary. Well, we, the living Americans, have gone through four wars. We\u2019ve gone through a Great Depression in our lifetime that literally was worldwide and almost brought us to our knees. But we came through all of those things and we achieved even new heights and new greatness. The living Americans today have fought harder, paid a higher price for freedom, and done more to advance the dignity of man than any people who ever lived on this earth. For 200 years, we\u2019ve lived in the future, believing that tomorrow would be better than today, and today would be better than yesterday. I still believe that. I\u2019m not running for the Presidency because I believe that I can solve the problems we\u2019ve discussed tonight. I believe the people of this country can, and together, we can begin the world over again. We can meet our destiny \u2013 and that destiny to build a land here that will be, for all mankind, a shining city on a hill. I think we ought to get at it."}

I think you\u2019ve seen tonight in this debate that Governor Reagan and I have agreed on exactly one thing \u2013 we are both against the reimposition of a peacetime draft. We have disagreed, I believe, on virtually every other issue. I respect him for showing tonight \u2013 for appearing here, and I thank the League of Women Voters for the opportunity that they have given me. I am running for President as an Independent because I believe our country is in trouble. I believe that all of us are going to have to begin to work together to solve our problems. If you think that I am a spoiler, consider these facts: Do you really think that our economy is healthy? Do you really think that 8 million Americans being out of work and the 50% unemployment among the youth of our country are acceptable? Do you really think that our armed forces are really acceptably strong in those areas of conventional capability where they should be? Do you think that our political institutions are working the way they should when literally only half of our citizens vote? I don\u2019t think you do think that. And therefore, I think you ought to consider doing something about it, and voting for an Independent in 1980. You know, a generation of office seekers has tried to tell the American people that they could get something for nothing. It\u2019s been a time, therefore, of illusion and false hopes, and the longer it continues, the more dangerous it becomes. We\u2019ve got to stop drifting. What I wish tonight so desperately is that we had had more time to talk about some of the other issues that are so fundamentally important. A great historian, Henry Steele Commager, said that in their lust for victory, neither traditional party is looking beyond November. And he went on to cite three issues that their platforms totally ignore: atomic warfare, Presidential Directive 59 notwithstanding. If we don\u2019t resolve that issue, all others become irrelevant. The issue of our natural resources; the right of posterity to inherit the earth, and what kind of earth will it be? The issue of nationalism \u2013 the recognition, he says, that every major problem confronting us is global, and cannot be solved by nationalism here or elsewhere \u2013 that is chauvinistic, that is parochial, that is as anachronistic as states\u2019 rights was in the days of Jefferson Davis. Those are some of the great issues \u2013 atomic warfare, the use of our natural resources, and the issue of nationalism \u2013 that I intend to be talking about in the remaining six weeks of this campaign, and I dare hope that the American people will be listening and that they will see that an Independent government of John Anderson and Patrick Lucey can give us the kind of coalition government that we need in 1980 to begin to solve our problems.

Now, I believe, also, that this meeting this mission, this responsibility for preserving the peace, which I believe is a responsibility peculiar to our country, and that we cannot shirk our responsibility as a leader of the free world because we\u2019re the only ones that can do it. Therefore, the burden of maintaining the peace falls on us. And to maintain that peace requires strength. America has never gotten in a war because we were too strong. We can get into a war by letting events get out of hand, as they have in the last three and a half years under the foreign policies of this Administration of Mr. Carter\u2019s, until we\u2019re faced each time with a crisis. And good management in preserving the peace requires that we control the events and try to intercept before they become a crisis. I have seen four wars in my lifetime. I\u2019m a father of sons; I have a grandson. I don\u2019t ever want to see another generation of young Americans bleed their lives into sandy beachheads in the Pacific, or rice paddies and jungles in the in Asia or the muddy battlefields of Europe."}

And my tax cut does not come close to eliminating that $86 billion increase. I\u2019m only reducing the amount of the increase.

CARTER","Text":"Mr. Stone, I\u2019ve had to make thousands of decisions since I\u2019ve been President, serving in the Oval Office. And with each one of those decisions that affect the future of my country, I have learned in the process. I think I\u2019m a much wiser and more experienced man than I was when I debated four years ago against President Ford. I\u2019ve also learned that there are no simple answers to complicated questions. H. L. Mencken said that for every problem there\u2019s a simple answer. It would be neat and plausible and wrong. The fact is that this nation, in the eight years before I became President, had its own military strength decreased. Seven out of eight years, the budget commitments for defense went down, 37% in all. Since I\u2019ve been in office, we\u2019ve had a steady, carefully planned, methodical but, very effective increase in our commitment for defense. But what we\u2019ve done is use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace. We\u2019ve not only kept peace for our own country, but we\u2019ve been able to extend the benefits of peace to others. In the Middle East, we\u2019ve worked for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, successfully, and have tied ourselves together with Israel and Egypt in a common defense capability. This is a very good step forward for our nation\u2019s security, and we\u2019ll continue to do as we have done in the past. I might also add that there are decisions that are made in the Oval Office by every President which are profound in nature. There are always trouble spots in the world, and how those troubled areas are addressed by a President alone in that Oval Office affects our nation directly, the involvement of the United States and also our American interests. That is a basic decision that has to be made so frequently, by every President who serves. That is what I have tried to do successfully by keeping our country at peace."}

And we\u2019ve made it clear that working with our allies and others, that we are prepared to address any foreseeable eventuality which might interrupt commerce with that crucial area of the world. But in doing this, we have made sure that we address this question peacefully, not injecting American military forces into combat, but letting the strength of our nation be felt in a beneficial way.

I would call to your attention that we were in a war that wound down during those eight years, which of course made a change in military spending because of turning from war to peace. I also would like to point out that Republican presidents in those years, faced with a Democratic majority in both houses of the Congress, found that their requests for defense budgets were very often cut. Now, Gerald Ford left a five-year projected plan for a military build-up to restore our defenses, and President Carter\u2019s administration reduced that by 38%, cut 60 ships out of the Navy building program that had been proposed, and stopped the the B-l, delayed the cruise missile, stopped the production line for the Minuteman missile, stopped the Trident or delayed the Trident submarine, and now is planning a mobile military force that can be delivered to various spots in the world which does make me question his assaults on whether I am the one who is quick to look for use of force."}

One is to control nuclear weapons, which I hope we\u2019ll get to later on because that is the most important single issue in this campaign. Another one is how to address troubled areas of the world. I think, habitually, Governor Reagan has advocated the injection of military forces into troubled areas, when I and my predecessors \u2013 both Democrats and Republicans \u2013 have advocated resolving those troubles in those difficult areas of the world peacefully, diplomatically, and through negotiation. In addition to that, the build-up of military forces is good for our country because we\u2019ve got to have military strength to preserve the peace. But I\u2019ll always remember that the best weapons are the ones that are never fired in combat, and the best soldier is one who never has to lay his life down on the field of battle. Strength is imperative for peace, but the two must go hand in hand."}

CARTER","Text":"Again it\u2019s important to put the situation in perspective. In 1974, we had a so-called oil shock, wherein the price of OPEC oil was raised to an extraordinary degree. We had an even worse oil shock in 1979. In 1974, we had the worst recession, the deepest and most penetrating recession since the Second World War. The recession that resulted this time was the briefest since the Second World War. In addition, we\u2019ve brought down inflation. Earlier this year, in the first quarter, we did have a very severe inflation pressure brought about by the OPEC price increase. It averaged about 18% in the first quarter of this year. In the second quarter, we had dropped it down to about 13%. The most recent figures, the last three months, on the third quarter of this year, the inflation rate is 7% \u2013 still too high, but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of jobs \u2013 nine million new jobs in the last three and a half years \u2013 that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us. I notice that Governor Reagan recently mentioned the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal. which his own running mate, George Bush, described as voodoo economics, and said that it would result in a 30% inflation rate. And Business Week, which is not a Democratic publication, said that this Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal \u2013 and I quote them, I think \u2013 was completely irresponsible and would result in inflationary pressures which would destroy this nation. So our proposals are very sound and very carefully considered to stimulate jobs, to improve the industrial complex of this country, to create tools for American workers, and at the same time would be anti-inflationary in nature. So to add nine million new jobs, to control inflation, and to plan for the future with an energy policy now intact as a foundation is our plan for the years ahead."}

At the same time, as I have said earlier, we have added about nine million net new jobs in that period of time \u2013 a record never before achieved. Also, the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors: One is conservation, which requires sacrifice, and the other one, increase in production of American energy, which is going along very well \u2013 more coal this year than ever before in American history, more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history. The new economic revitalization program that we have in mind, which will be implemented next year, would result in tax credits which would let business invest in new tools and new factories to create even more new jobs \u2013 about one million in the next two years. And we also have planned a youth employment program which would encompass 600,000 jobs for young people. This has already passed the House, and it has an excellent prospect to pass the Senate."}

REAGAN","Text":"Mr. Ellis, I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore it\u2019s uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious and it\u2019s dangerous to say this to the people. When Mr. Carter became President, inflation was 4.8%, as you said. It had been cut in two by President Gerald Ford. It is now running at 12.7%. President Carter also has spoken of the new jobs created. Well, we always, with the normal growth in our country and increase in population, increase the number of jobs. But that can\u2019t hide the fact that there are eight million men and women out of work in America today, and two million of those lost their jobs in just the last few months. Mr. Carter had also promised that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight against inflation. And yet, his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation, because in January, at the beginning of the year, it was more than 18%. Since then, he has blamed the people for inflation, OPEC, he has blamed the Federal Reserve system, he has blamed the lack of productivity of the American people, he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share in scarcity, we must sacrifice and get used to doing with less. We don\u2019t have inflation because the people are living too well. We have inflation because the Government is living too well. And the last statement, just a few days ago, was a speech to the effect that we have inflation because Government revenues have not kept pace with Government spending. I see my time is running out here. I\u2019ll have to get this out very fast. Yes, you can lick inflation by increasing productivity and by decreasing the cost of government to the place that we have balanced budgets, and are no longer grinding out printing press money, flooding the market with it because the Government is spending more than it takes in. And my economic plan calls for that. The President\u2019s economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way. But we will have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if we follow that path."}

I believe that there is enough extravagance and fat in government. As a matter of fact, one of the secretaries of HEW under Mr. Carter testified that he thought there was $7 billion worth of fraud and waste in welfare and in the medical programs associated with it. We\u2019ve had the Central Accounting. Office estimate that there is probably tens of billions of dollars that is lost in fraud alone, and they have added that waste adds even more to that. We have a program for a gradual reduction of Government spending based on these theories, and I have a task force now that has been working on where those cuts could be made. I\u2019m confident that it can be done and that it will reduce inflation because I did it in California. And inflation went down below the national average in California when we returned the money to the people and reduced Government spending."}

He would actually have to cut Government spending by at least $130 billion in order to balance the budget under this ridiculous proposal. I notice that his task force that is working for his future plans had some of their ideas revealed in The Wall Street Journal this week. One of those ideas was to repeal the minimum wage, and several times this year, Governor Reagan has said that the major cause of unemployment is the minimum wage. This is a heartless kind of approach to the working families of our country, which is typical of many Republican leaders of the past, but, I think, has been accentuated under Governor Reagan. In California \u2013 I\u2019m surprised Governor Reagan brought this up \u2013 he had the three largest tax increases in the history of that state under his administration. He more than doubled state spending while he was Governor \u2013 122% increase \u2013 and had between a 20% and 30% increase in the number of employees"}

The figures that the President has just used about California is a distortion of the situation there, because while I was Governor of California, our spending in California increased less per capita than the spending in Georgia while Mr. Carter was Governor of Georgia in the same four years. The size of government increased only one-sixth in California of what it increased in proportion to the population in Georgia. And the idea that my tax-cut proposal is inflationary: I would like to ask the President why is it inflationary to let the people keep more of their money and spend it the way that they like, and it isn\u2019t inflationary to let him take that money and spend it the way he wants?"}

Let the local entity, the city, declare this particular area, based on the standards of the percentage of people on welfare, unemployed, and so forth, in that area. And then, through tax incentives, induce the creation of businesses providing jobs and so forth in those areas. The elements of government through these tax incentives For example, a business that would not have, for a period of time, an increase in the property tax reflecting its development of the unused property that it was making wouldn\u2019t be any loss to the city because the city isn\u2019t getting any tax from that now. And there would simply be a delay, and on the other hand, many of the people who would then be given jobs are presently wards of the Government and it wouldn\u2019t hurt to give them a tax incentive, because they\u2026 that wouldn\u2019t be costing Government anything either. I think there are things to do in this regard. I stood in the South Bronx on the exact spot that President Carter stood on in 1977. You have to see it to believe it.

Windows smashed out, painted on one of them \u201cUnkept promises;\u201d on another, \u201cDespair.\u201d And this was the spot at which President Carter had promised that he was going to bring in a vast program to rebuild this department. There are whole or this area there are whole blocks of land that are left bare, just bulldozed down flat. And nothing has been done, and they are now charging to take tourists there to see this terrible desolation.

When I was campaigning in 1976, everywhere I went, the mayors and local officials were in despair about the rapidly deteriorating central cities of our nation. We initiated a very fine urban renewal program, working with the mayors, the governors, and other interested officials. This has been a very successful effort. That\u2019s one of the main reasons that we\u2019ve had such an increase in the number of people employed. Of the nine million people put to work in new jobs since I\u2019ve been in office, 1.3 million of those has been among black Americans, and another million among those who speak Spanish. We now are planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of rapid transit, mass transit. Under the windfall profits tax, we expect to spend about $43 billion in the next 10 years to rebuild the transportation systems of our country. We also are pursuing housing programs. We\u2019ve had a 73% increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education. These are the kinds of efforts worked on a joint basis with community leaders, particularly in the minority areas of the central cities that have been deteriorating so rapidly in the past. It\u2019s very important to us that this be done with the full involvement of minority citizens. I have brought into the top level, top levels of government, into the White House, into administrative offices of the Executive branch, into the judicial system, highly qualified black and Spanish citizens and women who in the past had been excluded. I noticed that Governor Reagan said that when he was a young man that there was no knowledge of a racial problem in this country. Those who suffered from discrimination because of race or sex certainly knew we had a racial problem. We have gone a long way toward correcting these problems, but we still have a long way to go."}

In the past, those minority groups have often been excluded from participation in the affairs of government. Since I\u2019ve been President, I\u2019ve appointed, for instance, more than twice as many black Federal judges as all previous presidents in the history of this country. I\u2019ve done the same thing in the appointment of women, and also Spanish-speaking Americans.

Now, the President spoke a moment ago about that I was against the minimum wage. I wish he could have been with me when I sat with a group of teenagers who were black, and who were telling me about their unemployment problems, and that it was the minimum wage that had done away with the jobs that they once could get. And indeed, every time it has increased you will find there is an increase in minority unemployment among young people. And therefore, I have been in favor of a separate minimum for them.

In all those elements, Governor Reagan has repeatedly spoken out against them, which, to me, shows a very great insensitivity to giving deprived families a better chance in life. This, to me, is a very important difference between him and me in this election, and I believe the American people will judge accordingly. There is no doubt in my mind that in the downtown central cities, with the, with the new commitment on an energy policy, with a chance to revitalize homes and to make them more fuel efficient, with a chance for our synthetic fuels program, solar power, this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends."}

There is no doubt that we have seen in recent years \u2013 in recent months \u2013 additional acts of violence against Jews in France and, of course, against those who live in Israel, by the PLO and other terrorist organizations. Ultimately, the most serious terrorist threat is if one of those radical nations, who believe in terrorism as a policy, should have atomic weapons. Both I and all my predecessors have had a deep commitment to controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons. In countries like Libya or Iraq, we have even alienated some of our closest trade partners because we have insisted upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries. When Governor Reagan has been asked about that, he makes the very disturbing comment that non-proliferation, or the control of the spread of nuclear weapons, is none of our business. And recently when he was asked specifically about Iraq, he said there is nothing we can do about it. This ultimate terrorist threat is the most fearsome of all, and it\u2019s part of a pattern where our country must stand firm to control terrorism of all kinds."}

Now, this comes from an answer that I\u2019ve made at least 50 times during this campaign to the press, when I am asked have you any ideas of what you would do if you were there? And I said, well, yes. And I think that anyone that\u2019s seeking this position, as well as other people, probably, have thought to themselves, what about this, what about that? These are just ideas of what I would think of if I were in that position and had access to the information, and which I would know all the options that were open to me. I have never answered the question, however; second, the one that says, well, tell me, what are some of those ideas? First of all, I would be fearful that I might say something that was presently under way or in negotiations, and thus expose it and endanger the hostages, and sometimes, I think some of my ideas might require quiet diplomacy where you don\u2019t say in advance, or say to anyone, what it is you\u2019re thinking of doing. Your question is difficult to answer, because, in the situation right now, no one wants to say anything that would inadvertently delay, in any way, the return of those hostages if there if there is a chance that they\u2019re coming home soon, or that might cause them harm. What I do think should be done, once they are safely here with their families, and that tragedy is over \u2013 we\u2019ve endured this humiliation for just lacking one week of a year now \u2013 then, I think, it is time for us to have a complete investigation as to the diplomatic efforts that were made in the beginning, why they have been there so long, and when they came home, what did we have to do in order to bring that about \u2013 what arrangements were made?

And that was, we had adequate warning that there was a threat to our embassy, and we could have done what other embassies did \u2013 either strengthen our security there, or remove our personnel before the kidnap and the takeover took place."}

Secondly, we all committed ourselves, as have all my predecessors in the Oval Office not to permit the spread of nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation, or to any other nation that does not presently have those weapons or capabilities for explosives. Third, not to make any sales of materiel or weapons to a nation which is involved in terrorist activities. And, lastly, not to deal with the PLO until and unless the PLO recognizes Israel\u2019s right to exist and recognizes UN Resolution 242 as a basis for Middle East peace.

And then, as we build up our national security, to restore our margin of safety, we at the same time try to restrain the Soviet build-up, which has been going forward at a rapid pace, and for quite some time. The SALT II treaty was the result of negotiations that Mr. Carter\u2019s team entered into after he had asked the Soviet Union for a discussion of actual reduction of nuclear strategic weapons. And his emissary, I think, came home in 12 hours having heard a very definite nyet. But taking that one no from the Soviet Union, we then went back into negotiations on their terms, because Mr. Carter had canceled the B-I bomber, delayed the MX, delayed the Trident submarine, delayed the cruise missile, shut down the Missile Man \u2013 the three \u2013 the Minuteman missile production line, and whatever other things that might have been done. The Soviet Union sat at the table knowing that we had gone forward with unilateral concessions without any reciprocation from them whatsoever. Now, I have not blocked the SALT II treaty, as Mr. Carter and Mr. Mondale suggest I have. It has been blocked by a Senate in which there is a Democratic majority. Indeed, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 0, with seven abstentions, against the SALT II treaty, and declared that it was not in the national security interests of the United States. Besides which, it is illegal, because the law of the land, passed by Congress, says that we cannot accept a treaty in which we are not equal. And we are not equal in this treaty for one reason alone \u2013 our B-2 bombers are considered to be strategic weapons; their Backfire bombers are not."}

Inflation. unemployment, the cities are all very important issues, but they pale into insignificance in the life and duties of a President when compared with the control of nuclear weapons. Every President who has served in the Oval Office since Harry Truman has been dedicated to the proposition of controlling nuclear weapons. To negotiate with the Soviet Union a balanced, controlled, observable, and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry, there is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of Governor Reagan. He has never supported any of those arms control agreements \u2013 the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford \u2013 and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a seven-year period, by myself and my two Republican predecessors. The Senate has not voted yet on the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty. There have been preliminary skirmishing in the committees of the Senate, but the Treaty has never come to the floor of the Senate for either a debate or a vote. It\u2019s understandable that a Senator in the preliminary debates can make an irresponsible statement, or, maybe, an ill-advised statement. You\u2019ve got 99 other senators to correct that mistake, if it is a mistake. But when a man who hopes to be President says, take this treaty, discard it, do not vote, do not debate, do not explore the issues, do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation \u2013 that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing."}

If President Brezhnev said, we will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American Presidents over a seven-year period of time, we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, it\u2019s obvious that I, as President, and all Americans, would reject such a proposition. This would mean the resumption of a very dangerous nuclear arms race. It would be very disturbing to American people. It would change the basic tone and commitment that our nation has experienced ever since the Second World War, with al Presidents, Democratic and Republican. And it would also be very disturbing to our allies, all of whom support this nuclear arms treaty.

My point I have made already, Mr. President, with regard to negotiating: it does not call for nuclear superiority on the part of the United States. It calls for a mutual reduction of these weapons, as I say, that neither of us can represent a threat to the other. And to suggest that the SALT II treaty that your negotiators negotiated was just a continuation, and based on all of the preceding efforts by two previous Presidents, is just not true. It was a new negotiation because, as I say, President Ford was within about 10% of having a solution that could be acceptable.

It can only be done in two ways: one, to conserve energy \u2013 to stop the waste of energy \u2013 and, secondly, to produce more American energy. We\u2019ve been very successful in both cases. We\u2019ve now reduced the importing of foreign oil in the last year alone by one-third. We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same date just a year ago. This commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our nation in the future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels, yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy, yes; and also to produce the traditional kinds of American energy. We will drill more oil and gas wells this year than any year in history. We\u2019ll produce more coal this year than any year in history. We are exporting more coal this year than any year in history. And we have an opportunity now with improved transportation systems and improved loading facilities in our ports, to see a very good opportunity on a world international market, to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source. This exciting future will not only give us more energy security, but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that we\u2019ve put into effect."}

The coal that the President mentioned \u2013 yes, we have it \u2013 and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now. The mines are closed down; there are 22000 miners out of work. Most of this is due to regulations which either interfere with the mining of it or prevent the burning of it:. With our modern technology, yes, we can burn our coal within the limits of the Clean Air Act. I think, as technology improves, we\u2019ll be able to do even better with that. The other thing is that we have only leased out \u2013 begun to explore \u2013 2% of our outer continental shelf for oil, where it is believed, by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy, that there are vast supplies yet to be found. Our Government has, in the last year or so, taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were \u2013 well, they were public lands subject to multiple use \u2013 exploration for minerals and so forth. It is believed that probably 70% of the potential oil in the United States is probably hidden in those lands, and no one is allowed to even go and explore to find out if it is there. This is particularly true of the recent efforts to shut down part of Alaska. Nuclear power: There were 36 power plants planned in this country. And let me add the word safety; it must be done with the utmost of safety. But 32 of those have given up and canceled their plans to build, and again, because Government regulations and permits, and so forth, take \u2013 make it take \u2013 more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the United States as it does to build one in Japan or in Western Europe.

We have a chance in the next 15 years, insisting upon the health and safety of workers in the mines, and also preserving the same high air and water pollution standards, to triple the amount of coal we produce. Governor Reagan\u2019s approach to our energy policy, which has already proven its effectiveness, is to repeal, or to change substantially, the windfall profits tax \u2013 to return a major portion of $227 billion back to the oil companies; to do away with the Department of Energy; to short-circuit our synthetic fuels program; to put a minimal emphasis on solar power; to emphasize strongly nuclear power plants as a major source of energy in the future.

And for Mr. Carter to suggest that I want to do away with the safety laws and with the laws that pertain to clean water and clean air, and so forth. As Governor of California, I took charge of passing the strictest air pollution laws in the United States \u2013 the strictest air quality law that has even been adopted in the United States. And we created an OSHA \u2013 an Occupational Safety and Health Agency \u2013 for the protection of employees before the Federal Government had one in place.

I am suggesting that there are literally thousands of unnecessary regulations that invade every facet of business, and indeed, very much of our personal lives, that are unnecessary; that Government can do without; that have added $130 billion to the cost of production in this country; and that are contributing their part to inflation.

The offshore drilling rights is a question that Governor Reagan raises often. As a matter of fact, in the proposal for the Alaska lands legislation, 100% of all the offshore lands would be open for exploration, and 95% of all the Alaska lands, where it is suspected or believed that minerals might exist. We have, with our five-year plan for the leasing of offshore lands, proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954.

It would have destroyed the economy of California, and, I must say, we had the support of Congress when we pointed out how ridiculous this attempt was by the Environmental Protection Agency. We still have the strictest air control, or air pollution laws in the country. As for offshore oiling, only 2% now is so leased and is producing oil. The rest, as to whether the lands are going to be opened in the next five years or so \u2013 we\u2019re already five years behind in what we should be doing.

Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance, and the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our nation\u2019s history \u2013 the payroll tax increase for Social Security \u2013 which will only put a band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most. What is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force of experts to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound, but with the premise that no one presently dependent on Social Security is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check. We cannot frighten, as we have with the threats and the campaign rhetoric that has gone on in this campaign, our senior citizens \u2013 leave them thinking that in some way, they\u2019re endangered and they would have no place to turn. They must continue to get those checks, and I believe that the system can be put on a sound actuarial basis.

I noticed also in The Wall Street Journal early this week, that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making Social Security more sound by reducing the adjustment in Social Security for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation. These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security, the well being and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age. But no matter what it takes in the future to keep Social Security sound, it must be kept that way. And although there was a serious threat to the Social Security System and its integrity during the 1976 campaign and when I became President, the action of the Democratic Congress working with me has been to put Social Security back on a sound financial basis.

It has, as I said, delayed the actuarial imbalance falling on us for just a few years with that increase in taxes, and I don\u2019t believe we can go on increasing the tax, because the problem for the young people today is that they are paying in far more than they can ever expect to get out. Now, again this statement that somehow, I wanted to destroy it and I just changed my tune, that I am for voluntary Social Security, which would mean the ruin of it. Mr. President, the voluntary thing that I suggested many years ago was that with a young man orphaned and raised by an aunt who died, his aunt was ineligible for Social Security insurance because she was not his mother. And I suggested that if this is an insurance program, certainly the person who is paying in should be able to name his own beneficiary. That is the closest I have ever come to anything voluntary with Social Security. I, too, am pledged to a Social Security program that will reassure these senior citizens of ours that they are going to continue to get their money. There are some changes that I would like to make. I would like to make a change in the regulation that discriminates against a wife who works and finds that she then is faced with a choice between her father\u2019s or her husband\u2019s benefits, if he dies first, or what she has paid in; but it does not recognize that she has also been paying in herself, and she is entitled to more than she presently can get.

It is obvious that we should have a commitment to them, that Social Security benefits should not be taxed and that there would be no peremptory change in the standards by which Social Security payments are made to retired people. We also need to continue to index Social Security payments, so that if inflation rises, the Social Security payments would rise a commensurate degree to let the buying power of a Social Security check continue intact. In the past, the relationship between Social Security and Medicare has been very important to providing some modicum of aid for senior citizens in the retention of health benefits. Governor Reagan, as a matter of fact, began his political career campaigning around this nation against Medicare. Now, we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance, with an emphasis on the prevention of disease, an emphasis on out-patient care, not in-patient care; an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care far those who are ill, an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance, so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because of a very high medical bill, then the insurance would help pay for it. These are the kinds of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people. Governor Reagan, again, typically is against such a proposal."}

Of course, it doesn\u2019t come out of the payroll tax. It comes out of a general fund, but something should be done about it. I think it is disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in Social Security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness, and they are receiving disability checks from Social Security every month while a state institution provides for all of their needs and their care."}

I noticed recently that Governor Reagan frequently quotes Democratic presidents in his acceptance address. I have never heard a candidate for President, who is a Republican, quote a Republican president, but when they get in office, they try to govern like Republicans.

CARTER","Text":"Barbara, reluctant as I am to say anything critical about Governor Reagan, I will try to answer your question. First of all, there is the historical perspective that I just described. This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I have taken in the Oval Office the last four years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others. The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who don\u2019t presently have it, particularly terrorist nations. The inclination that Governor Reagan has exemplified in many troubled times since he has been running for President \u2013 I think since 1968 \u2013 to inject American military forces in places like North Korea, to put a blockade around Cuba this year, or in some instances, to project American forces into a fishing dispute against the small nation of Ecuador on the west coast of South America. This is typical of his long-standing inclination, on the use of American power, not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully, but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it. Obviously, no President wants war, and I certainly do not believe that Governor Reagan, if he were President, would want war, but a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace, through diplomacy, or in a careless way in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past."}

I happen to believe that the Federal Government has usurped powers of autonomy and authority that belong back at the state and local level. It has imposed on the individual freedoms of the people, and there are more of these things that could be solved by the people themselves, if they were given a chance, or by the levels of government that were closer to them. Now, as to why I should be and he shouldn\u2019t be, when he was a candidate in 1976, President Carter invented a thing he called the misery index. He added the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation, and it came, at that time, to 12.5% under President Ford. He said that no man with that size misery index has a right to seek reelection to the Presidency. Today, by his own decision, the misery index is in excess of 20%, and I think this must suggest something. But, when I had quoted a Democratic President, as the President says, I was a Democrat. I said many foolish things back in those days. But the President that I quoted had made a promise, a Democratic promise, and I quoted him because it was never kept. And today, you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today. That\u2019s why I believe there are going to be millions of Democrats that are going to vote with us this time around, because they too want that promise kept. It was a promise for less government and less taxes and more freedom for the people."}

Six predecessors of mine who served in the Oval Office called for this guarantee of women\u2019s rights. Governor Reagan and his new Republican Party have departed from this commitment \u2013 a very severe blow to the opportunity for women to finally correct discrimination under which they have suffered. When a man and a women do the same amount of work, a man gets paid $1.00, a women only gets paid 59 cents. And the equal rights amendment only says that equality of rights shall not be abridged for omen b the Federal Government or by he state governments. That is all it says a simple guarantee of equality of opportunity which typifies the Democratic arty, and which is a very important commitment of mine, as contrasted with Governor Reagan\u2019s radical departure from the long-standing policy of his own party."}

Mr. President, once again, I happen to be against the amendment, because I think the amendment will take this problem out of the hands of elected legislators and put it in the hands f unelected judges.

While I was Governor, more than eight years ago, I found 14 separate instances where women were discriminated against in the body of California law, and I had passed and signed into law 14 statutes that eliminated those discriminations, including the economic ones that you have just mentioned \u2013 equal pay and so forth. I believe that if in all these years that we have spent trying to get the amendment, that we had spent as much time correcting these laws, as we did in California \u2013 and we were the first to do it. If I were President, I would also now take a look at the hundreds of Federal regulations which discriminate against women and which go right on while everyone is looking for an amendment. I would have someone ride herd on those regulations, and we would start eliminating those discriminations in the Federal Government against women."}

We have deregulated the air industry, the rail industry, the trucking industry, financial institutions. We\u2019re now working on the communications industry. In addition to that, I believe that this element of discrimination is something that the South has seen so vividly as a blight on our region of the country which has now been corrected \u2013 not only racial discrimination but discrimination against people that have to work for a living \u2013 because we have been trying to pick ourselves up by our bootstraps, since the long depression years, and lead a full and useful life in the affairs of this country.

Those would all, could all be challenged by men. And the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth. I thought that was the subject we were supposed to be on.

CARTER","Text":"First of all, I\u2019d like to thank the League of Women Voters for making this debate possible. I think it\u2019s been a very constructive debate and I hope it\u2019s helped to acquaint the American people with the sharp differences between myself and Governor Reagan. Also, I want to thank the people of Cleveland and Ohio for being such hospitable hosts during these last few hours in my life. I\u2019ve been President now for almost four years. I\u2019ve had to make thousands of decisions, and each one of those decisions has been a learning process. I\u2019ve seen the strength of my nation, and I\u2019ve seen the crises it approached in a tentative way. And I\u2019ve had to deal with those crises as best I could. As I\u2019ve studied the record between myself and Governor Reagan, I\u2019ve been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us. I think the result of this debate indicates that that fact is true. I consider myself in the mainstream of my party. I consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of Presidents who served before me. The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure. We must have a society that\u2019s just and fair. And we must extend the benefits of our own commitment to peace, to create a peaceful world. I believe that since I\u2019ve been in office, there have been six or eight areas of combat evolved in other parts of the world. In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country. I\u2019ve done that with moderation, with care, with thoughtfulness; sometimes consulting experts. But, I\u2019ve learned in this last three and a half years that when an issue is extremely difficult, when the call is very close, the chances are the experts will be divided almost 50-50. And the final judgment about the future of the nation \u2013 war, peace, involvement, reticence, thoughtfulness, care, consideration, concern \u2013 has to be made by the man in the Oval Office. It\u2019s a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people in the process, with an open Government, the job is a very gratifying one. The American people now are facing, next Tuesday, a lonely decision. Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country. And I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference. If one vote per precinct had changed in 1960, John Kennedy would never have been President of this nation. And if a few more people had gone to the polls and voted in 1968, Hubert Humphrey would have been President; Richard Nixon would not. There is a partnership involved in our nation. To stay strong, to stay at peace, to raise high the banner of human rights, to set an example for the rest of the world, to let our deep beliefs and commitments be felt by others in other nations, is my plan for the future. I ask the American people to join me in this partnership."}

I\u2019m sorry that we couldn\u2019t persuade the bringing in of the third candidate, so that he could have been seen also in these debates. But still, it\u2019s good that at least once, all three of us were heard by the people of this country. Next Tuesday is Election Day. Next Tuesday all of you will go to the polls, will stand there in the polling place and make a decision. I think when you make that decision, it might be well if you would ask yourself, are you better off than you were four years ago? Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago? Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago? Is America as respected throughout the world as it was? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we\u2019re as strong as we were four years ago? And if you answer all of those questions yes, why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for. If you don\u2019t agree, if you don\u2019t think that this course that we\u2019ve been on for the last four years is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have. This country doesn\u2019t have to be in the shape that it is in. We do not have to go on sharing in scarcity with the country getting worse off, with unemployment growing. We talk about the unemployment lines. If all of the unemployed today were in a single line allowing two feet for each of them, that line would reach from New York City to Los Angeles, California. All of this can be cured and all of it can be solved. I have not had the experience the President has had in holding that office, but I think in being Governor of California, the most populous state in the Union \u2013 if it were a nation, it would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world \u2013 I, too, had some lonely moments and decisions to make. I know that the economic program that I have proposed for this nation in the next few years can resolve many of the problems that trouble us today. I know because we did it there. We cut the cost \u2013 the increased cost of government \u2013 in half over the eight years. We returned $5.7 billion in tax rebates, credits and cuts to our people. We, as I have said earlier, fell below the national average in inflation when we did that. And I know that we did give back authority and autonomy to the people. I would like to have a crusade today, and I would like to lead that crusade with your help. And it would be one to take Government off the backs of the great people of this country, and turn you loose again to do those things that I know you can do so well, because you did them and made this country great. Thank you."}

CARTER","Text":"Yes. First of all is to recognize a tremendous economic strength in this country and to set the putting to \u2013 back to work of our people as a top priority. This is uh \u2013 an effort that ought to be done primarily by strong leadership in the White House, the inspiration of our people, the tapping of uh \u2013 business, agriculture, industry, labor and government at all levels to work on this uh project. We\u2019ll never have uh \u2013 an end to the inflationary spiral, and we\u2019ll never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work. There are several things that can be done specifically that are not now being done. First of all, to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide uh large numbers of jobs. Secondly, we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh \u2013 to cooperate with government in matters like housing. Here a very small investment of taxpayer\u2019s money \u2013 in the housing field can bring large numbers of extra jobs, and the guarantee of mortgage loans, and the uh \u2013 putting forward of uh \u2013 two-0-two programs for housing for older people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exists in the \u2013 in the construction industry. Another thing is to deal with our \u2013 uh needs in the central cities, where the unemployment rate is extremely high: sometimes among minority groups, or those who don\u2019t speak English, or who\u2019re black, or young people, or \u2013 40 percent of the employment. Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah \u2013 cha- in \u2013 in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work. Another very important \u2013 uh aspect of our \u2013 uh economy would be to increase production in every way possible, uh to hold down \u2013 uh taxes on individuals, and to uh shift the tax burdens onto those who have avoided paying taxes in the past. These uh \u2013 kinds of specific things, uh none of which are being done now, would be a great help in \u2013 in reducing uh unemployment. There is uh \u2013 uh an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very \u2013 very succinctly, and that is, to make sure that we have a good relationship between management \u2013 business on the one hand, and labor, on the other. In a > Transfer interrupted! ery high, we might channel specific uh targeted job \u2013 job \u2013 uh opportunities by paying part of the salary of unemployed people \u2013 uh and also sharing with uh \u2013 local governments the uh \u2013 payment of salaries which would uh \u2013 let us cut down the unemployment rate much lower, before we hit the inflationary level. But I believe that by the end of the first four years of uh \u2013 of the next term we could have the unemployment down to 3 percent adult unemployment, which is about uh \u2013 4 to 4 and a half percent overall uh controlled inflation rate and have a uh balance of growth of about \u2013 uh 4 to 6 percent, around 5 percent which would give us a balanced budget."}

I would not favor the uh \u2013 payment of uh \u2013 of a given fixed income to people unless they are not able to work.

I notice particularly that he didn\u2019t endorse the Humphrey-Hawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform. That legislation uh allegedly would help our unemployment, but uh \u2013 we all know that it would\u2019ve controlled our economy, it would\u2019ve added uh \u2013 ten to thirty billion dollars each year in additional expenditures by the Federal Government. It would\u2019ve called for export controls on agricultural products In my judgment the best way to get jobs is to uh \u2013 expand the private sector, where five out of six jobs today exist in our economy. We can do that by reducing Federal taxes as I proposed uh \u2013 about a year ago when I called for a tax reduction of $28 billion \u2013 three-quarters of it to go to private uh taxpayers and uh one-quarter to the business sector. We could add to jobs in the major metropolitan areas by a proposal that I recommended that would give tax incentives to business to move into the inner city and to expand or to build new plants so that they would take a plant, or expand a plant where people are, and people are currently unemployed. We could uh \u2013 also uh \u2013 help our youths with some of the proposals that uh \u2013 would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time just like we give money to young people who are going to college. Those are the kind of specifics that I think we have to discuss on these uh \u2013 debates, and these are the kind of programs that I\u2019ll talk about on my time."}

FORD","Text":"At the time, Mr. Gannon, that I made the recommendation for a $28 billion tax cut \u2013 three-quarters of it to go to individual taxpayers and 25 percent to American business. I said at the time that we had to hold the lid an federal spending, that for every dollar of a tax reduction we had to have an equal reduction in federal expenditures \u2013 a one-for-one proposition. And I recommended that to the Congress with a budget ceiling of three hundred and ninety-five billion dollars, and that would have permitted us to have a $25 billion tax reduction. In my tax reduction program for middle-income taxpayers, I recommended that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person. That would mean, of course, that for a family of four that that family would have a thousand dollars more personal exemption \u2013 money that they could spend for their own purposes, money that the government wouldn\u2019t have to spend. But if we keep the lid on federal spending, which I think we can \u2013 with the help of the Congress, we can justify fully a $28 billion tax reduction. In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending. For the last ten years the budget of the United States has grown from uh \u2013 about 11 percent per year. We can\u2019t afford that kind of growth in federal spending. And in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half \u2013 a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one-half percent. With that kind of limitation, on federal spending, we can fully justify the tax reductions that I have proposed. And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that we\u2019ll get more revenue and we\u2019ll have a more prosperous economy."}

I think the Congress should have uh \u2013 added another $10 billion reduction in personal income taxes, including the increase of personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars. And Congress could have done that if the budget committees of the Congress, and the Congress as a whole, had not increased the spending that I recommended in the budget. I\u2019m sure that you know that in the resolutions passed by the Congress, that have added about $17 billion in more spending, by the Congress over the budget that I recommended. So I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending. Now this tax bill \u2013 that hasn\u2019t reached the White House yet, but is expected in a day or two \u2013 it\u2019s about fifteen hundred pages. It has some good provisions in it. It has \u2013 uh left out some that I have recommended, unfortunately. On the other hand, uh when you have a bill of that magnitude, with \u2013 tho- those many provisions, a president has to sit and decide if there\u2019s more good than bad. And from the a- analysis that I\u2019ve made so far, it seems to me that that tax bill does uh \u2013 justify my signature and my approval."}

The present tax structure is a disgrace to this country; it\u2019s just a welfare program for the rich. As a matter of fact, uh \u2013 25 percent of the total tax deductions, go for only 1 percent of the richest people in this country, and over 50 percent of the tax uh credits go for the 14 percent of the richest people in this country. When Mr. Ford first became president in \u2013 in August of 1974, the first thing he did in \u2013 in October was to ask for a $4.7 billion increase in taxes on our people in the midst of the heaviest recession, since uh \u2013 since the great depression of nineteen uh \u2013 of the 1940s. In uh \u2013 January of 1975 he asked for a tax change: a $5.6 billion increase on low-and-middle-income private individuals, a six and a half billion dollar decrease on the corporations and the special interests. In uh \u2013 December of uh \u2013 1975 he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion dollar uh tax-reduction bill that had been passed by the Congress, and then he came back later on in January of this year and he did advocate a $10 billion tax reduction, but it would be offset by a $6 billion increase this coming January in deductions for Social Security payments and for unemployment compensation. The whole philosophy of the Republican party, including uh \u2013 my opponent, has been to pile on taxes on low-income people to take \u2019em off on the corporations. As a matter fact, in \u2013 sin- since the late sixties when Mr. Nixon took office, we\u2019ve had a reduction in uh \u2013 in the percentage of taxes paid by corporations from 30 percent down to about 20 percent. We\u2019ve had an increase in taxes paid by individuals, payroll taxes, from14 Percent up to 20 percent. And this is what the Republicans have done to us.

I feel that the taxpayers are the ones that need the relief: I don\u2019t think we should add additional programs of the magnitude that Governor Carter talks about. It seems to me that our tax structure today has rates that are too high. But I am uh \u2013 very glad to point out that since 1969, during a Republican administrations, we have had ten million people taken off of the tax rolls at the lower end of the taxpayer area. And at the same time, assuming that I sign the tax bill that was mentioned by Mr. Gannon, we will in the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers.

As a matter of fact \u2013 now- I don\u2019t advocate amnesty; I advocate pardon. There\u2019s a difference in my opinion \u2013 uh and in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court and accordance with the definition in the dictionary. Amnesty means that \u2013 that you uh \u2013 that what you did was right. Pardon means that what you did, whether it\u2019s right or wrong, you\u2019re forgiven for it. And I do advocate a pardon for \u2013 for draft evaders. I think it\u2019s accurate to say that in uh \u2013 two years ago when Mr. Nixon \u2013 Mr. Ford put in this uh amnesty that three times as many deserters were uh \u2013 excused as were \u2013 as were the uh \u2013 the ones who evaded the draft. But I think that now is the time to heal our country after the Vietnam War and I think that what the people are concerned about is not the \u2013 uh pardon or the amnesty of uh \u2013 those who evaded the draft, but \u2013 but whether or not our crime system is \u2013 is fair. We\u2019ve got a \u2013 a sharp distinction drawn between white collar crime \u2013 the \u2013 the \u2013 the big shots who are rich, who are influential uh very seldom go to jail; those who are poor and \u2013 and who have uh no influence \u2013 uh quite often are the ones who are punished. And \u2013 and the whole uh subject of crime is one that concerns our people very much, and I believe that the fairness of it is \u2013 is what \u2013 uh \u2013 is a \u2013 is a major problem that addresses our \u2013 our leader and this is something that hasn\u2019t been addressed adequately by \u2013 by this administration. But I \u2013 I hope to have a complete uh responsibility on my shoulders to help bring about a \u2013 a fair uh \u2013 criminal justice system and also to \u2013 to bring about uh \u2013 an end to the \u2013 to the divise- divisiveness that has occurred in our country uh as a result of the Vietnam War."}

When I took aver we had uh a bureaucratic mess, like we have in Washington now, and we had three hundred agencies, departments, bureaus, commissions \u2013 uh some uh \u2013 fully budgeted, some not, but all having responsibility to carry out that was in conflict. And we cut those three hundred \u2013 uh agencies and so forth down substantially. We eliminated two hundred and seventy-eight of them. We set up a simple structure of government that could be administrated fairly and it was a \u2013 a tremendous success. It hasn\u2019t been undone since I was there. It resulted also in an ability to reshape our court system, our prison system, our education system, our mental health programs and \u2013 and a clear assignment of responsibility and \u2013 and authority and also to have uh our people once again understanding control our government. I intend to do the same thing if I\u2019m elected president. When I get to Washington, coming in as an outsider, one of the major responsibilities that \u2013 that I will have on my shoulder is a complete reorganization of the \u2013 of the executive branch of government. We now have uh \u2013 a greatly expanded White House staff. When Mr. Nixon went in office, for instance, we had three and a half million dollars spent on \u2013 on the White House and its staff. That has escalated now to sixteen and a half million dollars, in the last uh Republican administration. This needs to be changed. We need to put the responsibilities back on the cabinet members. We also need to have a great reduction in agencies and programs. For instance, we now have uh \u2013 in the health area three hundred and two different programs administered by eleven major departments and agencies, sixty other advisory commissions responsible for this. Medicaid\u2019s in one agency; Medicare is in a different one. The \u2013 the check on the quality of health care is in a different one. None of them uh are responsible for health care itself. This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program. We have uh \u2013 just advocated uh \u2013 this past week a consolidation of the responsibilities for energy. Our country now has no comprehensive energy program or policy. We have twenty different agencies in the federal government responsible for the production, the regulation, the uh \u2013 information about energy, the conservation of energy, spread all over government. This is a \u2013 a gross waste of money, so tough, competent management of government, giving us a simple efficient purposeful and manageable government would be a great step forward and if I\u2019m elected \u2013 and I intend to be \u2013 then it\u2019s gonna be done."}

It took me about three years to completely reorganize the Georgia government. The last year I was in office uh \u2013 our budget was \u2013 was actually less than it was a year before, uh which showed a great uh improvement. Also, we had a \u2013 a 2 percent increase in the number of employees the last year. But it was a tremendous shift from administrative jobs into the delivery of services. For instance, we uh \u2013 completely revised our prison system. We established eighty-four new mental health treatment centers. And we shifted people out of administrative jobs into the field to deliver better services. The same thing will be done uh \u2013 at the federal government level. I \u2013 I accomplished this with s \u2013 substantial reductions in employees in some departments. For instance, in the Transportation Department uh we had uh \u2013 we cut back about 25 percent of the total number of employees. In giving our people better mental health care, we increased the number of employees. But the efficiency of it, the simplicity of it, the uh ability of people to understand their own government and control it was a \u2013 was a uh \u2013 substantial benefit derived from complete reorganization. We uh \u2013 have got to do that at the federal government level. If we don\u2019t, the bureaucratic mess is going to continue. There\u2019s no way for our people now to understand what their government is. There\u2019s no way to get the answer to a question. When you come to Washington to try to \u2013 as a governor \u2013 to try to begin a new program for your people, like uh the treatment of drug addicts, I found there were thirteen different federal agencies that I had to go to, to manage the uh drug treatment program. In the Georgia government we only had one agency responsible for drug treatment. This is the kind of change that would be made. And uh \u2013 it would be of \u2013 of tremendous benefit in long-range planning, in tight budgeting, uh saving the taxpayers\u2019 money, making the government more efficient, cutting down on bureaucratic waste, having a clear delineation of authority and responsibility of employees, and giving our people a better chance to understand and control their government."}

And there was some very interesting testimony given by Governor Carter\u2019s successor, Governor Busby, before a Senate committee a few uh \u2013 months ago on how he found the Medicaid program when he came into office following Governor Carter. He testified, and these are his words \u2013 the present governor of Georgia \u2013 he says he found the Medicaid program in Georgia in shambles. Now let me talk about what we\u2019ve done in the White House as far as federal employees are concerned The first order that I issued after I became president was to cut or eliminate the prospective forty-thousand increase in federal employees that had been scheduled by my predecessor. And in the term that I\u2019ve been president \u2013 some two years \u2013 we have reduced federal employment by eleven thousand. In the White House staff itself, when I became president, we had roughly five hundred and forty employees. We now have about four hundred and eighty-five employees, so we\u2019ve made a rather significant reduction in the number of employees on the White House staff working for the president. So I think our record of cutting back employees, plus the failure on the part of the Governor\u2019s programs to actually save employment in Georgia, shows which is the better plan."}

We were faced with uh \u2013 heavy inflation, over 12 percent; we were faced with substantial unemployment. But in the last uh \u2013 twenty-four months we\u2019ve turned the economy around and we\u2019ve brought inflation down to under 6 percent, and we have reduced the uh \u2013 well, we have added employment of about four million in the last seventeen months to the point where we have eighty-eight million people working in America today \u2013 the most in the history of the country. The net result is we are going to have some improvement in our receipts. And I think we\u2019ll have some decrease in our disbursements. We expect to have a lower deficit in fiscal year 1978. We feel that with this improvement in the economy; we feel with more receipts and fewer disbursements we can in a moderate way increase, as I recommended, over the next ten years a new parks program that would cast a billion and a half dollars, doubling our national park system. We have recommended that in the h- housing program we can reduce down payments and moderate monthly payments. But that doesn\u2019t cost any more as far as the federal treasury is concerned. We believe that we can uh do a better job in the area of crime, but that requires a tougher sentencing, mandatory certain prison sentences for those who violate our criminal laws. We \u2013 uh believe that uh you can revise the federal criminal code, which has not been revised in a good many years. That doesn\u2019t cost any more money. We believe that you can uhh \u2013 do something more effectively with a moderate increase in money in the drug abuse program. We feel that uh \u2013 in education we can have a slight increase \u2013 not a major increase. It\u2019s my understanding that Governor Carter has indicated that uh \u2013 he approves of a $30 billion uh \u2013 expenditure by the federal government as far as education is concerned. At the present time we\u2019re spending roughly three billion five hundred million dollars. I don\u2019t know where that money would come from.

We won\u2019t wait one year or two years longer, as Governor Carter uh \u2013 indicates.

In the last three months before an election, they\u2019re always for the programs that they always fight the other three-and-one-half years. Uh \u2013 I remember when uh \u2013 Herbert Hoover was against uh \u2013 jobs for people. I remember when Alf Landon was against Social Security and uh \u2013 later President Nixon, sixteen years ago, was telling the public that John Kennedy\u2019s proposals would bankrupt the country and would double the cost. The best thing to do is to look at the record uh \u2013 of Mr. Ford\u2019s Administration and Mr. Nixon\u2019s before his. Uh \u2013 we had last year a $65 billion deficit \u2013 the largest deficit in the history of our country \u2013 more of a deficit spending than we had in the entire eight-year period under President Johnson and President Kennedy. We\u2019ve got five hundred thousand more Americans out of jobs today than were out of work three months ago and since Mr. Ford\u2019s been in office two years, we\u2019ve had a 50 percent increase in unemployment from five million people out of work to two and a half million more people out of work and a total of seven and a half million. We\u2019ve also got uh \u2013 a comparison between himself and Mr. Nixon. He\u2019s got four times the size of the deficits that Mr. Nixon even had himself. This uh \u2013 talking about more people at work \u2013 uh is distorted because with a 14 percent increase in the cost of living in the last uh \u2013 two years, it means that \u2013 that women and young people have had to go to work when they didn\u2019t want to because their fathers didn\u2019t make enough to pay the increased cost of uh \u2013 food and uh housing and clothing. We have uh \u2013 in this last uh two years alone a hundred and twenty billion dollars total deficits under President Ford and uh \u2013 at the same time we\u2019ve had, in the last eight years, a doubling in the number of bankruptcies for small business: we\u2019ve had a negative growth in our \u2013 in our national economy measured in real dollars. The take-home pay of a worker in this country is actually less now than it was in 1968 \u2013 measured in real dollars. This is the kind of record that\u2019s there and talk about the future and a drastic change or conversion on the part of Mr. Ford as of last minute is one that just doesn\u2019t go."}

I think I know the \u2013 the uh capabilities and limitations of atomic power. But the energy \u2013 uh policy of our nation is one that uh has not yet been established under this administration. I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy except us. We have seen uh \u2013 the Federal Energy Agency established, for instance. Uh \u2013 in the crisis of 1973 it was supposed to be a temporary agency, uh now it\u2019s permanent, it\u2019s enormous, it\u2019s growing every day. I think the Wall Street Journal uh reported not too long ago they have a hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people its own existence. We\u2019ve got to have a \u2013 a firm way to handle the energy question. The reorganization proposal that I have put forward is one uh first step. In addition to that, we need to have \u2013 uh a realization that we\u2019ve got uh about thirty-five years worth of oil left in the whole world. We\u2019re gonna run out of oil. When Mr. Nixon made his famous uh speech on Operation Independence we were importing about 35 percent of our oil. Now we\u2019ve increased that amount 25 percent. We now import about 44 percent of our oil. We need to shift from oil to coal. We need to concentrate our research and development effort on uh coal burning and extraction, with safer mines, but also it\u2019s clean burning. We need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures. And then as a last resort only, continue to use atomic power. I would certainly uh \u2013 not cut out atomic power altogether. We can\u2019t afford to give up that opportunity until later. But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained. For instance, some that have been forgotten; we need to have the reactor core \u2013 below ground level, the entire power plant that uses atomic uh \u2013 power tightly sealed and a heavy \u2013 heavy vacuum maintained. There ought to be a standardized design. There ought to be a full-time uh \u2013 atomic energy specialist, independent of the power company in the control room, full time, twenty-four hours a day, to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops. These kinds of uh \u2013 procedures, along with evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated. So, shift from oil to coal, emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power, strict conservation measures, not yield every time that the special interest groups uh \u2013 put pressure on the president like uh this administration has done, and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strictest possible safety precautions. That\u2019s the best overall energy policy in the brief time we have to discuss it."}

And whenever the uh \u2013 automobile manufacturers come forward and say they can\u2019t meet the uh \u2013 amendments that the Congress has put forward, this Republican administration has delayed the implementation dates.

I recommended to the Congress that we should increase production in this country from six hundred million tons a year to twel- a- a billion two hundred million tons by 1985. In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground; we have to improve our utilization of coal \u2013 make it more efficient, make it cleaner. In addition we uh \u2013 have to expand our research and development. In my program for energy independence we have increased, for example, solar energy research from about $84 million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year. We\u2019re going as fast as the experts say we should. In nuclear power we have increased the research and development, uh \u2013 under the Energy Research and Development Agency uh \u2013 very substantially, to insure that our ener- uh \u2013 nuclear power plants are safer, that they are more efficient, and that we have adequate safeguards.

Our analysis indicates that something in the magnitude of about one hundred fifty to two hundred thousand jobs would uh \u2013 be made available. Each one of those jobs would\u2019ve cost the taxpayers $25 thousand. In addition, the jobs would not be available right now. They would not have materialized for about nine to eighteen months. The immediate problem we have is to stimulate our economy now so that we can get rid of unemployment. What we have done is to hold the lid on spending in an effort to reduce the rate of inflation. And we have proven, I think very conclusively, that you can reduce the rate of inflation and increase jobs. For example, as I have said, we have added some four million jobs in the last seventeen months. We have now employed eighty-eight million people in America, the largest number in the history of the United States. We\u2019ve added five hundred thousand jobs in the last two months. Inflation is the quickest way to destroy jobs. And by holding the lid on federal spending we have been able to do an- a good job, an affirmative job in inflation and as a result have added to the jobs in this country. I think it\u2019s uh \u2013 also appropriate to point out that through our tax policies we have stimulated uhh \u2013 added employment throughout the country, the investment tax credit, the tax incentives for expansion and modernization of our industrial capacity.

This affects human beings, and \u2013 and his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration, and not a work administration. He hasn\u2019t saved $9 billion with his vetoes. There\u2019s only been uh \u2013 a net savings of $4 billion. And the cost in unemployment compensation, welfare compensation, and lost revenues has increased $23 billion in the last two years. This is a \u2013 a typical attitude that really causes havoc in people\u2019s lives, and then it\u2019s covered over by saying that our country has naturally got a 6 percent unemployment rate, or 7 percent unemployment rate and a 6 percent inflation. It\u2019s a travesty. It shows a lack of leadership. And we\u2019ve never had a president since the War between the States that vetoed more bills. Mr. Ford has vetoed four times as many bills as Mr. Nixon \u2013 per year. And eleven of \u2019em have been overridden. One of his bills that was overridden \u2013 he only got one vote in the Senate and seven votes in the House, from Republicans."}

Over 50 percent \u2013 53 to be exact \u2013 percent of the tax benefits go to the 14 percent richest people in this country, and we\u2019ve had a 50 percent increase in payroll deductions since Mr. Nixon went in office eight years ago. Mr. Ford has \u2013 has advocated since he\u2019s been in office over $5 billion in reductions for corporations, special interest groups, and the very, very wealthy who derive their income \u2013 not from labor \u2013 but from investments. That\u2019s got to be changed. A few things that can be done: we have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporations who invest overseas \u2013 if they make a million dollars in profits overseas \u2013 they don\u2019t have to pay any of their taxes unless they bring their money back into this country. When they don\u2019t pay their taxes, the average American pays the taxes for them. Not only that, but it robs this country of jobs, because instead of coming back with that million dollars and creating a shoe factory, say in New Hampshire or Vermont, if the company takes the money down to Italy and \u2013 and builds a shoe factory, they don\u2019t have to pay any taxes on the money. Another thing is a system called DISC which was originally designed, proposed by Mr. Nixon, to encourage exports. This permits a company to create uh \u2013 a dummy corporation, to export their products, and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them. This costs our uh \u2013 government about uh \u2013 $1.4 billion a year. And when those rich corporations don\u2019t pay that tax, the average American taxpayer pays it for \u2019em. Another one that\u2019s uh \u2013 that\u2019s very important is the uh \u2013 is the business deductions, uh \u2013 jet airplanes, uh \u2013 first class travel, the fifty-dollar martini lunch. The average working person can\u2019t \u2013 uh \u2013 can\u2019t take advantage of that, but the \u2013 the wealthier people \u2013 uh can. Uh \u2013 another system is where uhh \u2013 a dentist can invest money in say, raising cattle and uh \u2013 can put in a hundred thousand dollars of his own money, borrow nine hundred thousand dollars \u2013 nine hundred mi- thousand dollars \u2013 that makes a million \u2013 and mark off a great amount of uh \u2013 of loss uh \u2013 through that procedure. Uh \u2013 there was one example, for instance, where uh \u2013 somebody uh \u2013 produced pornographic movies. They put in $30 thousand of their own money and got a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in tax savings. Well, these special kinds of programs have \u2013 have robbed the average taxpayer and have benefited those who are powerful, and who can employ lobbyists, and who can have their CPAs and their lawyers to help them benefit from the roughly uh \u2013 eight thousand pages of the tax code. The average uh American person can\u2019t do it. You can\u2019t hire a lobbyist uh out of unemployment compensation checks."}

Now you listed some things \u2013 the uh \u2013 deferral on foreign income as estimated: that would save about $500 million. DISC, you said, was about 1.4 billion. uh \u2013 The estimate of the outside, if you eliminated all tax shelters, is 5 billion. So where else would you raise the revenue to provide this tax relief \u2013 would you, in fact, do away with all business deductions, and what other kinds of preferences would you do away with? No, I wouldn\u2019t do away with all \u2013 uh business deductions. I think that would be a \u2013 a very serious mistake. But uh \u2013 if \u2013 if you could just do away with the ones that are unfair, you could lower taxes for everyone. I would never do anything that would increase the taxes for those who work for a living, or who are presently required to list all their income. What I wanna do is not to raise taxes, but to eliminate loopholes. And this is uh \u2013 the point of my first statistics that I gave you \u2013 that \u2013 that the present tax benefits that have been carved out over a long period of years \u2013 fifty years \u2013 by sharp tax lawyers and by lobbyists have benefited just the rich. These programs that I described to you earlier \u2013 the tax deferrals for overseas, the DISC, and the tax shelters, uh \u2013 they only apply to people in the $50 thousand-a-year bracket or up, and I think this is the very best way to approach it. It\u2019s to make sure that everybody pays taxes on the income that they earn and make sure that you take whatever savings there is from the higher income levels and give it to the lower- and middle-income families."}

In that interview uh \u2013 Governor Carter indicated that uh \u2013 he would raise the taxes on those in the medium or middle-income brackets or higher. Now if you uh \u2013 take the medium or middle-income taxpayer \u2013 that\u2019s about $14 thousand per person \u2013 uh \u2013 Governor Carter has indicated, publicly, in an interview that he would increase the taxes on about 50 percent of the working people of this country. I think uh \u2013 the way to get tax equity in this country is to give tax relief to the middle-income people who have an income from roughly $8 thousand up to twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars. They have been short-changed as we have taken ten million taxpayers off the tax rolls in the last eight years, and as we have uh \u2013 added to the minimum tax uh \u2013 provision to make all people pay more taxes. I believe in tax equity for the middle-income taxpayer, increasing the personal exemption. Mr. Carter wants to increase taxes for roughly half of the taxpayers of this country. Now, the Governor has also played a little fast and loose with the facts about vetoes. The records show that President Roosevelt vetoed an average of fifty-five bills a year. President Truman vetoed on the average, while he was president, about thirty-eight bills a year. I understand that Governor Carter, when he was Governor of Georgia, vetoed between thirty-five and forty bills a year. My average in two years is twenty-six. But in the process of that we have saved uhh \u2013 $9 billion. And one final comment, uh \u2013 Governor Carter talks about the tax bills and all of the inequities that exist in the present law. I must remind him the Democrats have controlled the Congress for the last twenty-two years and they wrote all the tax bills."}

In the last two years, we have restored integrity in the White House, and we\u2019ve set high standards in the executive branch of the government. The anti-Washington feeling, in my opinion, ought to be focused on the Congress of the United States. For example, this Congress, very shortly, will spend a billion dollars a year for its housekeeping, its salaries, its expenses and the like. It \u2013 the next Congress will probably be the first billion-dollar Congress in the history of the United States. I don\u2019t think the American people are getting their money\u2019s worth from the majority party that run this Congress. We, in addition, see that uh \u2013 in the last uh \u2013 four years the number of employees hired by the Congress has gone up substantial- uh much more than uh \u2013 the gross national product, much more than any other increase throughout our society. Congress is hiring people by the droves, and the cast as a result has gone up. And I don\u2019t see any improvement in the performance of the Congress under the present leadership. So it seems to me instead of the anti-Washington feeling being aimed at everybody in Washington, it seems to me that the focus should be where the problem is, which is the Congress of the United States, and particularly the majority in the Congress. They spend too much money on themselves. They have too many employees. There\u2019s some question about their morality. It seems to me that in this election, the focus should not be on the executive branch but the corrections should come as the voters vote for their members of the House of Representatives or for their United States senator. That\u2019s where the problem is and I hope there\u2019ll be some corrective action taken so we can get some new leadership in the Congress of the United States."}

But let me take the other side of the coin, if I might. Supposing we had \u2013 had a Democratic Congress for the last two years and we\u2019d had uh \u2013 Governor Carter as President. He has, in effect, said that he would agree with all of \u2013 he would disapprove of the vetoes that I have made, and would have added significantly to expenditures and the deficit in the federal government. I think it would be contrary to one of the basic concepts in our system of government \u2013 a system of checks and balances. We have a Democratic Congress today, and fortunately we\u2019ve had a Republican president to check their excesses with my vetoes. If we have a Democratic Congress next year, and a president who wants to spend an additional one hundred billion dollars a year, or maybe two hundred billion dollars a year, with more programs, we will have in my judgment, greater deficits with more spending, more dangers of inflation. I think the American people want a Republican president to check on any excesses that come out of the next Congress, if it is a Democratic Congress."}

Even President Nixon, because he was a strong leader at least, worked with a Democratic Congress very well. Uh \u2013 Mr. Ford has vetoed, as I said earlier, four times as many bills per year as Mr. Nixon. Mr. Ford quite often puts forward a program just as a public relations stunt, and never tries to put it through the Congress by working with the Congress. I think under presidents For- uh \u2013 Nixon and Eisenhower they passed about 60 to 75 percent of their legislation. This year Mr. Ford will not pass more than 26 percent of all the legislative proposals he puts forward. This is government by stalemate, and we\u2019ve seen almost a complete breakdown in the proper relationship between the president, who represents this country, and the Congress, who collectively also represent this country. We\u2019ve had uh \u2013 Republican presidents before who\u2019ve tried to run against a Democratic \u2013 uh Congress. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s uh \u2013 the Congress is Mr. Ford\u2019s opponent; but if uh \u2013 if \u2013 if he insists that uh \u2013 that I be responsible for the Democratic Congress, of which I\u2019m \u2013 have not been a part, then I think it\u2019s only fair that he be responsible for the Nixon administration in its entirety, of which he was a part. That, I think, is a good balance. But the point is, that \u2013 that a president ought to lead this country. Mr. Ford, so far as I know, except for avoiding another Watergate, has not accomplished one single major program for this country. And there\u2019s been a constant squabbling between the president and the Congress, and that\u2019s not the way this country ought to be run. I might go back to one other thing. Mr. Ford has uh \u2013 misquoted an AP uh \u2013 news story that was in error to begin with. That story reported several times that I would lower taxes for low and middle-income families and uh \u2013 that correction was delivered to the White House and I am sure that the president knows about this uh \u2013 correction, but he still insists uh \u2013 on repeating an erroneous statement."}

The president can modify the uh \u2013 economic structure of a country by public statements and general attitudes in the budget that he proposes. The Federal Reserve has uh \u2013 an independent status that ought to be preserved; I think that Mr. uh \u2013 Burns did take a typical, erroneous Republican attitude in the 1973 year when inflation was so high. They assumed that the uh \u2013 inflation rate was because of excessive demand and uh \u2013 therefore put into effect tight constraint on the economy, very high interest rates, which is typical also of the Republican administration, uh \u2013 tried to increase the uh \u2013 the tax uh \u2013 payments by individuals, and cut the tax payments by corporations.

Our nation in the last eight years has been divided as never before. It\u2019s a time for unity. It\u2019s a time to draw ourselves together: to have a president and a Congress that can work together with mutual respect for a change, cooperating for a change, in the open for a change, so the people can understand their own government. It\u2019s time for government, industry, labor, manufacturing, agriculture, education, other entities in our society to cooperate. And it\u2019s a time for government to understand and to cooperate with our people. For a long time our American citizens have been excluded, sometimes misled, sometimes have been lied to. This is uh \u2013 not compatible with the purpose of our nation. I believe in our country. It needs to be competent. The government needs to be well-managed, efficient, economical, We need to have a government that\u2019s sensitive to our people\u2019s needs \u2013 to those who are poor, who don\u2019t have adequate health care, who have been cheated too long with our tax programs, who\u2019ve been out of jobs, whose families have been torn apart. We need to restore the faith and the trust of the American people in their own government. In addition to that, we\u2019ve suffered because we haven\u2019t had leadership in this administration. We\u2019ve got a government of stalemate. We\u2019ve lost the vision of what our country can and ought to be. This is not the America that we\u2019ve known in the past. It\u2019s not the America that we have to have in the future. I don\u2019t claim to know all the answers. But I\u2019ve got confidence in my country. Our economic strength is still there. Our system of government \u2013 in spite of Vietnam, Cambodia, CIA, Watergate \u2013 is still the best system of government on earth. And the greatest resource of all are the two hundred and fifteen million Americans who have within us the strength, the character, the intelligence, the experience, the patriotism, the idealism, the compassion, the sense of brotherhood on which we can rely in the future to restore the greatness to our country We ought not to be excluded from our government anymore. We need a president who can go in \u2013 who derives his strength from the people. I owe the special interests nothing. I owe everything to you, the people of this country. And I believe that we can bind our wounds. I believe that we can work together.

A president should never promise more than he can deliver and a president should always deliver everything that he\u2019s promised. A president can\u2019t be all things to all people. A president should be the same thing to all people. Another issue in this campaign, Governor Carter has endorsed the Democratic platform, which calls for more spending, bigger deficits, more inflation or mare taxes. Governor Carter has embraced the record of the present Congress, dominated by his political party. It calls for more of the same. Governor Carter in his acceptance speech called for more and more programs, which means more and more government. I think the real issue in this campaign, and that which you must decide on November second, is whether you should vote for his promise or my performance in two years in the White House. On the fourth of July we had a wonderful two hundredth birthday \u2013 for our great country. It was a superb occasion. It was a glorious day. In the first century of our nation\u2019s history our forefathers gave us the finest form of government in the history of mankind. In the second century of our nation\u2019s history, our forefathers developed the most productive industrial nation in the history of the globe. Our third century should be the century of individual freedom for all our two hundred and fifteen million Americans today and all that join us. In the last few years government has gotten bigger and bigger; industry has gotten larger and larger; labor unions have gotten bigger and bigger; and our children have been the victims of mass education. We must make this next century the century of the individual. We should never forget that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have. The individual worker in the plants throughout the United States should not be a small cog in a big machine. The member of a labor union must have his rights strengthened and broadened and our children in their education should have an opportunity to improve themselves based on their talents and their abilities. My mother and father, during the Depression, worked very hard to give me an opportunity to do better in our great country. Your mothers and fathers did the same thing for you and others. Betty and I have worked very hard to give our children a brighter future in the United States, our beloved country.

In every one of these instances, the Ford administration has failed, and I hope tonight that I and Mr. Ford will have a chance to discuss the reasons for those failures. Our country is not strong anymore; we\u2019re not respected anymore. We can only be strong overseas if we\u2019re strong at home; and when I became president we\u2019ll not only be strong in those areas but also in defense \u2013 a defense capability second to none. We\u2019ve lost in our foreign policy, the character of the American people. We\u2019ve uh \u2013 ignored or excluded the American people and the Congress from participation in the shaping of our foreign policy. It\u2019s been one of secrecy and exclusion. In addition to that we\u2019ve had a chance to became now, contrary to our long-standing beliefs and principles, the arms merchant of the whole world. We\u2019ve tried to buy success from our enemies, and at the same time we\u2019ve excluded from the process the normal friendship of our allies. In addition to that we\u2019ve become fearful to compete with the Soviet Union on an equal basis. We talk about detente. The Soviet Union knows what they want in detente, and they\u2019ve been getting it. We have not known what we\u2019ve wanted and we\u2019ve been out-traded in almost every instance. The other point I wanna make is about our defense. We\u2019ve got to be a nation blessed with a defense capability that\u2019s efficient, tough, capable, well organized, narrowly focused \u2013 fighting capability. The ability to fight, if necessary, is the best way to avoid the chance for, or the requirement to fight. And the last point I wanna make is this: Mr. Ford, Mr. Kissinger have uh \u2013 continued on with the policies and failures of Richard Nixon. Even the Republican platform has criticized the lack of leadership in Mr. Ford and they\u2019ve criticized the foreign policy of this administration. This is one instance where I agree with \u2013 with the Republican platform.

Mr. Ford has shown an absence of leadership, and an absence of a grasp of what this country is and what it ought to be. That\u2019s got to be changed.

About uh \u2013 late October of 1975, I asked the then Secretary of Defense, Mr. Schlesinger, to tell me what had to be done if we were going to reduce the defense budget by uh \u2013 three to five billion dollars. A few days later, Mr. Schlesinger came back and said if we cut the defense budget by three to five billion dollars, we will have to cut military personnel by two hundred and fifty thousand, civilian personnel by a hundred thousand, jobs in America by a hundred thousand. We would have to stretch out our aircraft procurement, we would have to reduce our naval construction program, we would have to reduce the uh \u2013 research and development for the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and Marines by 8 percent. We would have to close twenty military bases in the United States immediately. That\u2019s the kind of defense program that uh \u2013 Mr. Carter wants. Let me tell you this straight from the shoulder. You don\u2019t negotiate with Mr. Brezhnev from weakness. And the kind of defense program that Mr. Carter wants will mean a weaker defense and a poor negotiating position."}

I think it\u2019s in the best interest of the United States, and the world as a whole that the United States negotiate rather than go back to the cold-war relationship with the Soviet Union. I don\u2019t uh \u2013 look at the picture as bleakly as you have indicated in your question, Mr. Trewhitt. I believe that the United States ha- had many successes in recent years, in recent months, as far as the Communist movement is concerned. We have been successful in Portugal, where a year ago it looked like there was a very great possibility that the uh \u2013 Communists would take over in Portugal. It didn\u2019t happen. We have a democracy in Portugal today. A few uh \u2013 months ago, or I should say, maybe two years ago, the Soviet Union looked like they had continued strength in the Middle East. Today, according to Prime Minister Rabin, the Soviet Union is weaker in the Middle East than they have been in many, many years. The facts are, there \u2013 the Soviet Union relationship with Egypt is uh \u2013 at a low level. The Soviet Union relationship with Syria is at a very low point. The United States today, according to Prime Minister Rabin of Israel, is a- at a peak in its uh \u2013 influence and power in the Middle East. But let\u2019s turn for a minute to the uhh \u2013 southern African operations that are now going on. The United States of America took the initiative in southern Africa. We wanted to end the bloodshed in southern Africa. We wanted to have the right of self-determination in southern Africa. We wanted to have majority rule with the full protection of the rights of the minority. We wanted to preserve human dignity in southern Africa. We have taken the initiative, and in southern Africa today the United States is trusted by the black front-line nations and black Africa. The United States is trusted by other elements in southern Africa. The United States foreign policy under this administration has been one of progress and success. And I believe that instead of talking about Soviet progress, we can talk about American successes. And may I make an observation \u2013 part of the question you asked, Mr. Trewhitt? I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s in the best interest of the United States and the NATO nations to have a Communist government in NATO. Mr. Carter has indicated he would look with sympathy to a Communist government in NATO. I think that would destroy the integrity and the strength of NATO, and I am totally opposed to it."}

That would obviously be a ridiculous thing for anyone to do who wanted to be president of this country. I think that this is uh \u2013 an instance of uh \u2013 deliberate distortion, and this has occurred also in the question about defense. As a matter of fact, uh \u2013 I\u2019ve never advocated any cut of $15 billion in our defense budget. As a matter of fact, Mr. Ford has made a political football out of the defense budget. About a year ago he cut the Pentagon budget six point eight billion dollars. After he fired James Schlesinger, the political heat got so great that he added back about $3 billion. When Ronald Reagan won the Texas primary election, Mr. Ford added back another one and a half billion dollars. Immediately before the Kansas City convention, he added back another one point eight billion dollars in the defense budget. And his own uh \u2013 Office of Management and Budget testified that he had a $3 billion cut insurance added to the defense budget \u2013 defense budget under the pressure from the Pentagon. Obviously, this is another indication of trying to use the defense budget for political purposes, which he\u2019s trying to do tonight. Now, we went into south Africa late, after Great Britain, Rhodesia, the black nations had been trying to solve this problem for many, many years. We didn\u2019t go in until right before the election, similar to what was taking place in 1972, when Mr. Kissinger announced peace is at hand just before the election at that time. And we have weakened our position in NATO because the other countries in Europe supported the democ- democratic forces in Portugal long before we did; we stuck to the Portugal dictatorships much longer than other democracies did in this world."}

I am a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, the first military graduate since uh \u2013 Eisenhower. I\u2019ve served as the Governor of Georgia and have traveled extensively in foreign countries and South America, Central America, Europe, the Middle East and in Japan. I\u2019ve traveled the last twenty-one months among the people of this country. I\u2019ve talked to them and I\u2019ve listened. And I\u2019ve seen at first hand, in a very vivid way, the deep hurt that\u2019s come to this country in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia, Chile, and Pakistan, and Angola, and Watergate, CIA revelations. What we were formerly so proud of \u2013 the strength of our country, its uh \u2013 moral integrity, the representation in foreign affairs of what our people are, what our Constitution stands for, has been gone. And in the secrecy that has surrounded our foreign policy in the last few years, uh \u2013 the American people, the Congress have been excluded. I believe I know what this country ought to be. I\u2019ve uh \u2013 been one who\u2019s loved my nation as many Americans do, and I believe that there\u2019s no limit placed on what we can be in the future, if we can harness the tremendous resources \u2013 militarily, economically, and the stature of our people, the meaning of the Constitution, in the future. Every time we\u2019ve made a serious mistake in foreign affairs, it\u2019s been because the American people have been excluded from the process. If we can just tap the intelligence and ability, the sound common sense and the good judgment of the American people, we can once again have a foreign policy to make us proud instead of ashamed. And I\u2019m not gonna exclude the American people from that process in the future, as Mr. Ford and Kissinger have done. This is what it takes to have a sound foreign policy strong at home, strong defense, permanent commitments, not betray the principles of our country, and involve the American people and the Congress in the shaping of our foreign policy. Every time Mr. Ford speaks from a position of secrecy in negotiations, in secret \u2013 in secret treaties that\u2019ve been uh \u2013 pursued and achieved, in supporting dictatorships, in ignoring human rights, we are weak and the rest of the world knows it. So these are the ways that we can restore the strength of our country, and they don\u2019t require long experience in foreign policy. Nobody has that except a president who has served a long time or a secretary of state. But my background, my experience, my knowledge of the people of this country, my commitment to our principles that don\u2019t change \u2013 those are the best bases to correct the horrible mistakes of this administration and restore our own country to a position of leadership in the world."}

In many instances we\u2019ve made agreements, like in Vietnam, uh \u2013 that have uh \u2013 been revealed later on to our uh \u2013 embarrassment. Recently Ian Smith, the uh \u2013 president of uh \u2013 Rhodesia, announced that he had unequivocal commitments from Mr. Kissinger that he could not reveal. The American people don\u2019t know what those commitments are. We\u2019ve seen uh \u2013 in the past the destruction of elected governments, like in Chile, and the strong support of military dictatorship there. These kinds of things have hurt us very much. I would restore the concept of the fireside chat, which was an integral part of the administration of Franklin Roosevelt. And I would also restore the involvement of the Congress. When Harry Truman was president he was not afraid to have a strong secretary of defense. Dean Acheson, George Marshall were strong secretaries of uh \u2013 state \u2013 excuse me \u2013 state. But he also made sure that there was a bipartisan support. The members of Congress, Arthur Vandenberg, Walter George, were part of the process, and before our nation made a secret agreement, or before we made a bluffing statement, we were sure that we had the backing not only of the president and the secretary of state, but also of the Congress and the people. This is a responsibility of the president. And I think it\u2019s very damaging to our country for Mr. Ford to have turned over this responsibility to the secretary of state."}

But let me talk just a minute about what we\u2019ve done to avoid secrecy in the Ford administration. After the United States took the initiative in working with Israel and with Egypt and achieving the Sinai II agreement \u2013 and I\u2019m proud to say that not a single Egyptian or Israeli soldier has lost his life since the signing of the Sinai agreement. But at the time that uh \u2013 I submitted the Sinai agreement to the Congress of the United States, I submitted every single document that was applicable to the Sinai II agreement. It was the most complete documentation by any president of any agreement signed by a president on behalf of the United States. Now as far as meeting with the Congress is concerned, during the twenty-four months that I\u2019ve been the president of the United States I have averaged better than one meeting a month with responsible groups or committees of the Congress \u2013 both House and Senate. The secretary of state has appeared in the several years that he\u2019s been the secretary before eighty different uh \u2013 committee hearings in the House and in the Senate.

FORD","Text":"I believe that we have uh \u2013 negotiated with the Soviet Union since I\u2019ve been president from a position of strength. And let me cite several examples. Shortly after I became president in uh \u2013 December of 1974, I met with uh \u2013 General Secretary Brezhnev in Vladivostok and we agreed to a mutual cap on the ballistic missile launchers at a ceiling of twenty-four hundred \u2013 which means that the Soviet Union, if that becomes a permanent agreement, will have to make a reduction in their launchers that they now have or plan to have. I\u2019ve negotiated at Vladivostok with uh \u2013 Mr. Brezhnev a limitation on the MIRVing of their ballistic missiles at a figure of thirteen-twenty, which is the first time that any president has achieved a cap either on launchers or on MIRVs. It seems to me that we can go from there to uh \u2013 the uh \u2013 grain sales. The grain sales have been a benefit to American agriculture. We have achieved a five and three quarter year uh \u2013 sale of a minimum six million metric tons, which means that they have already bought about four million metric tons this year and are bound to buy another two million metric tons to take the grain and corn and wheat that the American farmers have produced in order to uh \u2013 have full production. And these grain sales to the Soviet Union have helped us tremendously in meeting the costs of the additional oil and \u2013 the oil that we have bought from overseas. If we turn to Helsinki \u2013 I\u2019m glad you raised it, Mr. uh \u2013 Frankel. In the case of Helsinki, thirty-five nations signed an agreement, including the secretary of state for the Vatican \u2013 I can\u2019t under any circumstances believe that the \u2013 His Holiness, the Pope would agree by signing that agreement that the thirty-five nations have turned over to the Warsaw Pact nations the domination of the \u2013 Eastern Europe. It just isn\u2019t true. And if Mr. Carter alleges that His Holiness by signing that has done it, he is totally inaccurate. Now, what has been accomplished by the Helsinki agreement? Number one, we have an agreement where they notify us and we notify them of any uh \u2013 military maneuvers that are to be be undertaken. They have done it. In both cases where they\u2019ve done so, there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford administration."}

CARTER","Text":"(chuckle) Well, in the first place, I\u2019m not criticizing His Holiness the Pope. I was talking about Mr. Ford. The uh \u2013 fact is that secrecy has surrounded the decisions made by the Ford administration. In the case of the Helsinki agreement \u2013 it may have been a good agreement at the beginning, but we have failed to enforce the so-called basket three part, which insures the right of people to migrate, to join their families, to be free, to speak out. The Soviet Union is still jamming Radio Free Europe \u2013 Radio \u2013 uh- uh \u2013 Radio Free Europe is being jammed. We\u2019ve also seen a very serious uh \u2013 problem with the so-called Sonnenfeldt document, which apparently Mr. Ford has just endorsed, which said that there\u2019s an organic linkage between the Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union. And I would like to see Mr. Ford convince the Polish-Americans and the Czech-Americans and the Hungarian-Americans in this country that those countries don\u2019t live under the domination and supervision of the Soviet Union behind the Iron \u2013 uh \u2013 Curtain. We also have seen Mr. Ford exclude himself from access to the public. He hasn\u2019t had a tough cross-examination-type press conference in over thirty days. One press conference he had without sound. He\u2019s also shown a weakness in yielding to pressure. The Soviet Union, for instance, put pressure on Mr. Ford and he refused to see a symbol of human freedom recognized around the world, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. The Arabs have put pressure on Mr. Ford, and he\u2019s yielded, and has permitted a boycott by the Arab countries of American businesses who trade with Israel, or who have American Jews owning or taking part in the management of American \u2013 companies. His own secretary of commerce had to be subpoenaed by the Congress to reveal the names of businesses who were subject to this boycott. They didn\u2019t volunteer the information. He had to be subpoenaed. And the last thing I\u2019d like to say is this: This grain deal with the Soviet Union in \u201972 was terrible, and Mr. Ford made up for it with three embargoes, one against our own ally in Japan. That\u2019s not the way to run our foreign policy, including international trade."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1976 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Second Carter-Ford Presidential Debate","Date":213408000000,"Participants":"Carter-Ford","Moderators":"MS. FREDERICK","Speaker":"MR. CARTER","Text":"I would never single out food as a trade embargo item. If I ever decided to impose an embargo because of a crisis in international relationships, it would include all shipments of all equipment. For instance, if the Arab countries ever again declare an embargo against our nation on oil I would consider that not a military but an economic declaration of war, and I would respond instantly and in kind. I would not ship that Arab country anything \u2013 no weapons, no spare parts for weapons, no oil-drilling rigs, no oil pipe, no nothing. I wouldn\u2019t single out just food. Another thing that I\u2019d like to say is this: In our international trade, as I said in my op- opening statement, we have become the arms merchant of the world. When this Republican administration came into office we were shipping about $1 billion worth of arms overseas, now ten to twelve billion dollars worth of arms overseas to countries that quite often use these weapons to fight each other. The shift in emphasis has been very disturbing to me, speaking about the Middle East. Under the last Democratic administration 60 percent of all weapons that went into the Middle East were for Israel. Nowadays \u2013 75 percent were for Israel before. Now 60 percent go to the Arab countries, and this does not include Iran. If you include Iran, our present shipment of weapons to the Middle East, only 20 percent goes to Israel. This is a deviation from idealism; it\u2019s a deviation from a commitment to our major ally in the Middle East, which is Israel; it\u2019s a yielding to economic pressure on the part of the Arabs on the oil issue; and it\u2019s also a tremendous indication that under the Ford administration we have not addressed the energy policy adequately. We still have no comprehensive energy policy in this country. And it\u2019s an overall sign of weakness. When we are weak at home economically \u2013 high unemployment, high inflation, a confused government, a wasteful defense establishment, this encourages the kind of pressure that\u2019s been put on us successfully. It would\u2019ve been inconceivable ten \u2013 fifteen years ago, for us to be brought to our knees with an Arab oil embargo. But it was done three years ago and they\u2019re still putting pressure on us from the Arab countries to our discredit around the world. These are the weaknesses that I see, and I believe it\u2019s not just a matter of idealism. It\u2019s a matter of being tough. It\u2019s a matter of being strong. It\u2019s a matter of being consistent. Our priorities ought to be first of all to meet our own military needs, secondly to meet the needs of our allies and friends, and only then should we ship military equipment to foreign countries. As a matter of fact, Iran is gonna get eighty F-14s before we even meet our own Air Force orders for F-l4s. And the shipment of Spruance-class destroyers to Iran are much more highly sophisticated than the Spruance-class destroyers that are present being delivered to our own Navy. This is ridiculous and it ought to be changed."}

So the Ford administration has done a good job in helping our good ally, Israel, and we\u2019re dedicated to the survival and security of Israel. I believe that Governor Carter doesn\u2019t realize the need and necessity for arms sales to Iran. He indicates he would not make those. Iran is bordered very extensively by the Soviet Union. Iran has Iraq as one of its neighbors. The Soviet Union and the Communist-dominated government of Iraq are neighbors of Iran, and Iran is an ally of the United States. It\u2019s my strong feeling that we ought to sell arms to Iran for its own national security, and as an ally \u2013 a strong ally of the United States. The history of our relationship with Iran goes back to the days of President Truman when he decided that it was vitally necessary for our own security as well as that of Iran, that we should help that country, and Iran has been a good ally. In 1973 when there was an oil embargo, Iran did not participate. Iran continued to sell oil to the United States. I believe that it\u2019s in our interest and in the interest of Israel and Iran, and Saudi Arabia, for the United States to sell arms to those countries.

As a matter of fact, during this current year uh we are shipping Iran, or have contracted to ship to Iran, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms and also to Saudi Arabia, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms. Also in 1975, we almost brought Israel to their knees after the uh \u2013 Yom Kippur War by the so-called reassessment of our relationship to Israel. We in effect tried to make Israel the scapegoat for the problems in the Middle East. And this weakened our relationships with Israel a great deal and put a cloud on the total commitment that our people feel toward the Israelis.

These uh \u2013 characteristics of our country have been endangered under Mr. Ford. We\u2019re no longer respected in a showdown vote in the United Nations or in \u2013 in any other international council we\u2019re lucky to get 20 percent of the other nations to vote with us. Our allies feel that we\u2019ve neglected them. The so-called Nixon shock against Japan had weakened our relationships there. Under this administration we\u2019ve also had an inclination to keep separate the European countries, thinking that if they are separate, then we can dominate them and proceed with our secret, Lone Ranger-type diplomatic efforts. I would uh \u2013 also like to point out that we, in this country, have let our economy go down the drain. The worst inflation since the Great Depression. The highest unemployment of any developed nation of the world. We have a higher unemployment rate in this country than Great Britain, and West Germany. Our unemployment rate is twice as high as it is in Italy; it\u2019s three or four times as high as it is \u2013 as it is in Japan. And that terrible circumstance in this country is exported overseas. We comprise about 30 percent of the world\u2019s economic trade power influence. And when we\u2019re weak at home \u2013 weaker than all our allies \u2013 that weakness weakens the whole free world. So strong economy is very important. Another thing that we need to do is to reestablish the good relationships that we ought to have between the United States and our natural allies and friends. They have felt neglected. And using that base of strength, and using the idealism, the honesty, the predictability, the commitment, the integrity of our own country, that\u2019s where our strength lies. And that would permit us to deal with the developing nations in a position of strength. Under this administration we\u2019ve had a continuation of the so-called balance of power politics, where everything is looked on as a struggle between us on the one side, the Soviet Union on the other. Our allies \u2013 the smaller countries get trampled in the rush. What we need is to try to seek individualized bilateral relationships with countries, regardless of their size, and to establish world-order politics, which means that we want to preserve peace through strength. We also wanna revert back to the stature and the respect that our country had in previous administrations. Now, I can\u2019t say when this can come.

CARTER","Text":"Well let me say very quickly that under President Johnson, in spite of the massive investment in the Vietnam War, he turned over a balanced budget to Mr. Nixon. The unemployment rate was less than 4 percent. The inflation rate under Kennedy and Johnson was about 2 percent \u2013 one-third what it is under this administration. So we did have at that time with good management, the ability to do both. I don\u2019t think that anybody can say that Johnson and Kennedy neglected the poor and the destitute people in this country or around the world. But I can say this: The number one responsibility of any president, above all else, is to guarantee the security of our nation \u2013 an ability to be free of the threat of attack, or blackmail and to carry out our obligations to our allies and friends, and to carry out a legitimate foreign policy. They must go hand in hand, but the security of this nation has got to come first."}

FORD","Text":"Let me say very categorically you cannot maintain the security of the United States with the kind of defense budget cuts that Governor Carter has indicated. In 1975 he wanted to cut the budget $15 billion. He\u2019s now down to a figure of five to seven billion dollars. Reductions of that kind will not permit the United States to be strong enough to deter aggression and maintain the peace. Governor Carter apparently doesn\u2019t know the facts. As soon as I became president, I initiated a meeting with the NATO heads of state and met with them in Brussels to discuss how we could improve the re- defense relationship in Western Europe. In uh \u2013 November of 1975 I met with the leaders of the five industrial nations in France for the purpose of seeing what we could do acting together to meet the problems of uh \u2013 the coming recession. In Puerto Rico this year, I met with six of the leading industrial nations\u2019 heads of state to meet the problem of inflation so we would be able to solve it before it got out of hand. I have met with the heads of government bilaterally as well as multilaterally. Our relations with Japan have never been better. I was the first United States president to visit Japan. And we uh \u2013 had the emperor of Japan here this uh \u2013 past year and the net result is Japan and the United States are working more closely together now than at any time in the history of our relationship. You can go around the world \u2013 and let me take Israel for example. Just recently, President Rabin said that our relations were never better."}

FORD","Text":"First we have to understand that SALT I expires October third 1977. Uh \u2013 Mr. Brezhnev and I met in Vladivostok in December of 1974 for the purpose of trying to take the initial step so we could have a SALT II agreement that would go to l985. As I indicated earlier, we did agree on a twenty-four-hundred limitation on uh \u2013 uh \u2013 launchers of ballistic missiles. Uh \u2013 that would mean a cutback in the Soviet program; it would not interfere with our own program. At the same time, we put a limitation of thirteen hundred and twenty on MIRVs. Our technicians have been working since that time in Geneva, trying to put into technical language a \u2013 an agreement that can be verified by both parties. In the meantime, there has developed the problem of the Soviet Backfire \u2013 their high-performance aircraft which they say is not a long-range aircraft and which some of our people say is a intercontinental aircraft. In the interim, there has been the development on our part primarily, the cruise missiles; cruise missiles that could be launched from land-based mobile installations; cruise missiles that could be launched \u2013 launched from high-performance aircraft, like the B-52s or the B-1s, which I hope we proceed with; cruise missiles which could be launched from either surface or submarine uh \u2013 naval vessels. Those gray-area weapons systems are creating some problems in a \u2013 the agreement for a SALT II negotiation. But I can say that I am dedicated to proceeding, and I met just last week with the foreign minister of the Soviet Union, and he indicated to me that uh \u2013 the Soviet Union was interested in narrowing the differences and making a realistic and a sound compromise. I hope and trust, in the best interest of both countries, and in the best interests of all people throughout this globe, that the Soviet Union and the United States can make a mutually beneficial agreement. Because if we do not and SALT I expires on October three, 1977, you will unleash again an all-out nuclear arms race with the potential of a nuclear holocaust of unbelievable dimensions. So it\u2019s the obligation of the president to do just that, and I intend to do so."}

They are a new weapons system that has a great potential, both conventional and nuclear armed. At the same time, we have to make certain that the Soviet Union\u2019s Backfire, which they claim is not an intercontinental aircraft and which some of our people contend is, must also be included if we are to get the kind of agreement which is in the best interest of both countries. And I really believe that it \u2013 it\u2019s far better for us and for the Soviet Union, and more importantly for the people around the world, that these two superpowers find an answer for a SALT II agreement before October three, 1977. I think good will on both parts, hard bargaining by both parties and a reasonable compromise will be in the best interests of all parties."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1976 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Second Carter-Ford Presidential Debate","Date":213408000000,"Participants":"Carter-Ford","Moderators":"MS. FREDERICK","Speaker":"MR. CARTER","Text":"Well, Mr. Ford acts like he\u2019s uh \u2013 running for president for the first time. He\u2019s been in office two years, and there has been absolutely no progress made toward a new SALT agreement. He has learned the date of the expiration of SALT I, apparently. We\u2019ve seen, in this world, a development of a tremendous threat to us. As a nuclear engineer myself, I know the limitations and capabilities of atomic power. I also \u2013 know that as far as the human beings on this earth are concerned that the nonproliferation of atomic weapons is number one. Only the last few days with the election approaching, has Mr. Ford taken any interest in a nonproliferation movement. I advocated last May in a speech at the United Nations that we move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear devices, both weapons and peaceful devices; that we not ship any more atomic fuel to a country that refuses to comply with strict controls over the waste which can be reprocessed into explosives. I\u2019ve also advocated that we stop the sale by Germany and France of \u2013 processing plants for Pakistan and Brazil. Mr. Ford hasn\u2019t moved on this. We also need to provide an adequate supply of enriched uranium. Mr. Ford, again, under pressure from the atomic energy lobby, has insisted that this reprocessing or rather re-en- enrichment be done by private industry and not by the existing uh \u2013 government uh \u2013 plants. This kind of confusion and absence of leadership has let us drift now for two years with a constantly increasing threat of atomic weapons throughout the world. We now have five nations that have atomic bombs that we know about. If we continue under Mr. Ford\u2019s policy by 1985 or \u201990 we\u2019ll have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons. This has got to be stopped. That is one of the major challenges and major undertakings that I will assume as the next president."}

Also, we\u2019ll never be strong again overseas, unless we\u2019re strong at home. And with our economy in such terrible disarray and getting worse by the month. We\u2019ve got five-hundred thousand more Americans unemployed today than we had three months ago. We\u2019ve got two and a half million more Americans out of work now than we had when Mr. Ford took office. This kind of deterioration in our economic strength is bound to weaken us around the world. And we not only have uh problems at home but we export those problems overseas. So as far as the respect of our own people toward our own government, as far as participating in the shaping of uh \u2013 concepts and commitments, as far as the trust of our country among the nations of the world, as far as dependence of our country in meeting the needs and obligations that we\u2019ve expressed to our allies, as far as the respect of our country \u2013 even among our potential adversaries \u2013 we are weak.

I must remind him that we\u2019re at peace and during the period that he brags about unemployment being low, the United States was at war. Now let me correct one other comment that uh \u2013 Governor Carter has made. I have recommended to the Congress that we develop the uranium enrichment plant at Portsmouth, Ohio, which is a publicly owned \u2013 U.S. government facility and have indicated that the private program which would follow on in Alabama is one that may or may not uhh \u2013 be constructed. But I am committed to the one at Portsmouth, Ohio. The governor also talks about morality in foreign policy. The foreign policy of the United States meets the highest standards of morality. What is more moral than peace, and the United States is at peace today? What is more moral in foreign policy than for the administration to take the lead in the World Food Conference in Rome in 1974 when the United States committed six million metric tons of food \u2013 over 60 percent of the food committed for the disadvantaged and underdeveloped nations of the world? The Ford administration wants to eradicate hunger and disease in our underdeveloped countries throughout the world. What is more moral than for the United States under the Ford administration to take the lead in southern Africa, in the Middle East? Those are initiatives in foreign policy which are of the highest moral standard and that is indicative of the foreign policy of this country."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1976 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Second Carter-Ford Presidential Debate","Date":213408000000,"Participants":"Carter-Ford","Moderators":"MS. FREDERICK","Speaker":"MR. FORD","Text":"I believe that uh \u2013 our foreign policy must express the highest standards of morality. And the initiatives that we took in southern Africa are the best examples of what this administration is doing and will continue to do in the next four years. If the United States had not moved when we did in southern Africa, there\u2019s no doubt there would have been an acceleration of bloodshed in that tragic part of the world. If we had not taken our initiative, it\u2019s very, very possible that uh \u2013 the government of Rhodesia would have been overrun and that the Soviet Union and the Cubans would have dominated uh \u2013 southern Africa. So the United States, seeking to preserve the principle of self-determination, to eliminate the possibility of bloodshed, to protect the rights of the minority as we insisted upon the rights of the majority, uh \u2013 I believe followed the good conscience of the American people in foreign policy. And I believe that we used our skill. Secretary of State Kissinger has done a superb job in working with the black African nations, the so-called front-line nations. He has done a superb job in getting the prime minister of South Africa, Mr. Vorster, to agree that the time had come for a solution to the problem of Rhodesia. Secretary Kissinger, in his meeting with uh \u2013 Prime Minister Smith of Rhodesia, was able to convince him that it was in the best interests of whites as well as blacks in Rhodesia to find an answer for a transitional government and then a majority government. This is a perfect example of the kind of leadership that the United States, under this administration, has taken. And I can assure you that this administration will follow that high moral principle in our future efforts in foreign policy, including our efforts in the Middle East where it is vitally important because the Middle East is the crossroads of the world. There\u2019ve been more disputes in its area where there\u2019s more volatility than any other place in the world. But because Arab nations and the Israelis trust the United States, we were able to take the lead in the Sinai II Agreement. And I can assure you that the United States will have the leadership role in moving toward a comprehensive settlement of the Middle Eastern problems, I hope and trust as soon as possible. And we will do it with the highest moral principles."}

Let me take uh \u2013 South Korea as an example. I have personally told President Pack that the United States does not condone the kind of repressive measures that he has taken in that country. But I think in all fairness and equity we have to recognize the problem that South Korea has. On the north they have North Korea with five hundred thousand well-trained, well-equipped troops \u2013 they are supported by the People\u2019s Republic of China; they are supported by the Soviet Union. South Korea faces a very delicate situation. Now the United States, in this case, this administration, has recommended a year ago and we have reiterated it again this year, that the United States, South Korea, North Korea and the uh \u2013 People\u2019s Republic of China sit down at a conference table to resolve the problems of the Korean peninsula.

CARTER","Text":"I notice that Mr. Ford didn\u2019t comment on the uh \u2013 prisons in Chile. This is an \u2013 a typical example, maybe of many others, where this administration overthrew an elected government and helped to establish a military dictatorship. This has not been an ancient history story. Last year under Mr. Ford, of all the Food for Peace that went to South America, 85 percent went to the military dictatorship in Chile. Another point I wanna make is this. He says we have to move from one area of the world to another. That\u2019s one of the problems with this administration\u2019s so-called shuttle diplomacy. While the secretary of state\u2019s in one country, there are almost a hundred and fifty others that are wondering what we\u2019re gonna do next, what will be the next secret agreement. We don\u2019t have a comprehensive understandable foreign policy that deals with world problems or even regional problems. Another thing that concerned me was what Mr. Ford said about unemployment, that \u2013 insinuating that under Johnson and Kennedy that unemployment could only be held down when this country is at war. Karl Marx said that the free enterprise system in a democracy can only continue to exist when they are at war or preparing far war. Karl Marx was the grandfather of Communism. I don\u2019t agree with that statement. I hope Mr. Ford doesn\u2019t either. He has put pressure on the Congress \u2013 and I don\u2019t believe Mr. Ford would even deny this \u2013 to hold up on nonproliferation legislation until the Congress agreed for an $8 billion program for private industry to start producing enriched uranium. And the last thing I wanna make is this. He talks about peace and I\u2019m thankful for peace. We were peaceful when Mr. Ford went into office. But he and Mr. Kissinger and others tried to start a new Vietnam in Angola, and it was only the outcry of the American people and the Congress when their secret deal was discovered that prevented our involvement in that conflagration which was taking place there."}

When Mr. Reagan raised this uh \u2013 question in Florida uh \u2013 Mr. Ford not only disavowed his instructions, but he also even dropped, parenthetically, the use of the word \u201cdetente.\u201d I would never give up complete control or practical control of the Panama Canal Zone, but I would continue to negotiate with the Panamanians. When the original treaty was signed back in the early 1900s, when Theodore Roosevelt was president, Panama retained sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone. We retained control as though we had sovereignty. Now I would be willing to go ahead with negotiations. I believe that we could share more fully responsibilities for the Panama Canal Zone with Panama. I would be willing to continue to raise the payment for shipment of goods through the Panama Canal Zone.

But there are certain guidelines that must be followed, and I\u2019ve just defined them. Let me take just a minute to comment on something that Governor Carter said. On non \u2013 nu- oh \u2013 uh \u2013 nonproliferation, in May of l975, I called for a conference of uh \u2013 nuclear suppliers. That conference has met six times.

I was very disappointed in the fact that the uh \u2013 GAO released that report because I think it interjected political partisan politics at the present time. But let me comment on the report. Somebody who sits in Washington, D.C., eighteen months after the Mayaguez incident, can be a very good grandstand quarterback. And let me make another observation. This morning, I got a call from the skipper of the Mayaguez. He was furious because he told me that it was the action of me, President Ford, that saved the lives of the crew of the Mayaguez. And I can assure you that if we had not taken the strong and forceful action that we did, we would have been uh \u2013 criticized very, very uh \u2013 severely for sitting back and not moving. Captain Miller is thankful. The crew is thankful. We did the right thing. It seems to me that those who sit in Washington eighteen months after the incident are not the best judges of the decision-making process that had to be made by the National Security Council and by myself at the time the incident was developing in the Pacific. Let me assure you that we made every possible overture to the People\u2019s Republic of China and through them to the Cambodian Government. We made uh \u2013 diplomatic uh \u2013 protests to the Cambodian government through the United Nations. Every possible diplomatic means was utilized. But at the same time, I had a responsibility, and so did the National Security Coun- Council, to meet the problem at hand. And we handled it responsibly and I think Captain Miller\u2019s testimony to that effect is the best evidence."}

I think the American people have only one \u2013 uh requirement \u2013 that the facts about Mayaguez be given to them accurately and completely. Mr. Ford has been there for eighteen months. He had the facts that were released today immediately after the Mayaguez incident. I understand that the report today is accurate. Mr. Ford has said, I believe, that it was accurate, and that the White House made no attempt to block the issuing of that report. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s exactly accurate or not.

When something happens that endangers our security, or when something happens that threatens our stature in the world, or when American people are endangered by the actions of a foreign country, uh \u2013 just forty uh sailors on the Mayaguez, we obviously have to move aggressively and quickly to rescue them.

And I might add that uh \u2013 my administration \u2013 and I\u2019m very proud of it \u2013 is the first administration that has taken an antitrust action against companies in this country that have allegedly cooperated with the Arab boycott. Just on Monday of this week I signed a tax bill that included an amendment that would prevent companies in the United States from taking a tax deduction if they have in any way whatsoever cooperated with the Arab boycott. And last week when we were trying to get the Export Administration Act through the Congress \u2013 necessary legislation \u2013 my administration went to Capitol Hill and tried to convince the House and the Senate that we should have an amendment on that legislation which would take strong and effective action against those who uh \u2013 participate or cooperate with the Arab uh boycott.

I believe we can and we ought to. Now we\u2019ve been hurt in recent years in this country. In the aftermath of Vietnam, Cambodia, Chile, Pakistan, Angola, Watergate, CIA, we\u2019ve been hurt. Our people feel that we\u2019ve lost something precious. That\u2019s not necessary. I wanna see our nation \u2013 return to a posture and an image and a standard to make us proud once again. I remember the world with NATO, and the world of Point Four, and the world of the Marshall Plan, and the world of the Peace Corps. Why can\u2019t we have that once again? We ought to be a beacon for nations who search for peace and who search for freedom, who search for individual liberty, who search for basic human rights. We haven\u2019t been lately. We can be once again. We\u2019ll never have that world leadership until we are strong at home, and we can have that strength if we return to the basic principles. It ought not to be a strength of bombast and threats. It ought to be a quiet strength based on the integrity of our people, the vision of the Constitution, an in- innate strong will and purpose that God\u2019s given us in the greatest nation on earth \u2013 the United States."}

Which means, of course, that uh \u2013 we will have to maintain an adequate military capability \u2013 which means, of course, that we will have to add a uh \u2013 I think uh \u2013 a few billion dollars to our defense appropriations to make certain that we have adequate uh -strategic forces \u2013 adequate conventional forces. I think the American people will be called upon to uh \u2013 uh \u2013 be in the forefront in giving leadership to the solution of those problems that must be solved in the Middle East, in southern Africa, and any problems that might arise in the Pacific. The American people will be called upon to tighten their belts a bit in meeting some of the problems that we face domestically. I don\u2019t think that uh \u2013 America can go on a big spending spree with a whole lot of new programs uh \u2013 that would add significantly to the federal budget. I believe that the American people, if given the leadership that I would expect to give, would be willing to give this thrust to preserve the peace and the necessary restraint at home to hold the lid on spending so that we could, I think, have a long overdue and totally justified tax decrease for the middle-income people. And then, with the economy that would be generated from a restraint on spending, and a tax uh reduction primarily for the middle-income people, then I think the American people would be willing to make those sacrifices for peace and prosperity in the next uh \u2013 four years."}

Doesn\u2019t your policy really imply that we\u2019re going to have a fairly high rate of unemployment over a fairly long time, that growth is gonna be fairly slow, and that we\u2019re not gonna be able to do much \u2013 very much in the next four or five years to meet the basic agenda of our national needs in the cities, in health, uh in transit and a whole lot of things like that. Not at all. overlapping, aren\u2019t those the real costs? No, Mr. Kraft, we\u2019re spending very significant amounts of money now, some $200 billion a year, almost 50 percent of our total federal expenditure uh \u2013 by the federal government at the present time for human needs. Now we will probably need to increase that to same extent. But we don\u2019t have to have \u2013 growth in spending that will blow the lid off and add to the problems of inflation. I believe we can meet the problems within the cities of this country and still uh \u2013 give a tax reduction. I proposed, as you know, a reduction to increase the personal exemption from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars. With the fiscal program that I have, and if you look at the projections, it shows that we will reduce unemployment, that we will continue to win the battle against inflation, and at the same time give the kind of quality of life that I believe is possible in America. Uh \u2013 a job, a home for all those that\u2019ll work and save for it, uh \u2013 safety in the streets, uh \u2013 health that is a \u2013 health care that is affordable.

CARTER","Text":"Well I might say first of all that I think in case of the Carter administration the sacrifices would be much less. Mr. Ford\u2019s own uh \u2013 environmental agency has projected a 10 percent unemployment rate by 1978 if he\u2019s uh \u2013 president. The American people are ready to make sacrifices if they are part of the process. If they know that they will be helping to make decisions and won\u2019t be excluded from being an involved party to the national purpose. The major effort we must put forward is to put our people back to work. And I think that this uh \u2013 is one example where uh \u2013 a lot of people have selfish, grasping ideas now. I remember 1973 in the depth of the uh \u2013 energy crisis when President Nixon called on the American people to make a sacrifice, to cut down on the waste of uh \u2013 gasoline, to cut down on the uh \u2013 speed of automobiles. It was a \u2013 a tremendous surge of patriotism, that \u201cI want to make a sacrifice for my country.\u201d I think we uh \u2013 could call together, with strong leadership in the White House, business, industry and labor, and say let\u2019s have voluntary price restraints. Let\u2019s lay down some guidelines so we don\u2019t have continuing inflation. We can also have a- an end to the extremes. We now have one extreme for instance, of some welfare recipients, who by taking advantage of the welfare laws, the housing laws, the uh \u2013 Medicaid uh \u2013 laws, and the uh \u2013 food stamp laws, make over $10 thousand a year and uh \u2013 they don\u2019t have to pay any taxes on it. At the other extreme, uh \u2013 just 1 percent of the richest people in our country derive 25 percent of all the tax benefits. So both those extremes grasp for advantage and the person who has to pay that expense is the middle-income family who\u2019s still working for a living and they have to pay for the rich who have privilege, and for the poor who are not working. But I think uh \u2013 uh \u2013 a balanced approach, with everybody being part of it and a striving for unselfishness, could help as it did in 1973 to let people sacrifice for their own country. I know I\u2019m ready for it. I think the American people are too."}

When you\u2019ve got seven and a half, eight million people out of work, and you\u2019ve got three times as much inflation as you had during the last eight-year Democratic administration, when you have the highest deficits in history; when you have it uh \u2013 becoming increasingly difficult far a family to put a child through college or to own a home, there\u2019s a natural inclination to be turned off. Also, in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia and uh \u2013 Watergate and uh \u2013 the CIA revelations, people have feel \u2013 have felt that they\u2019ve uh been betrayed by public officials, I have to admit that in the uh \u2013 heat of the campaign \u2013 I\u2019ve been in thirty primaries during the springtime, I\u2019ve been campaigning for twenty-two months \u2013 I\u2019ve made some mistakes. And I think this is uh \u2013 uh \u2013 part of uh \u2013 of just being a human being. I \u2013 I have to say that my campaign has been an open one. And uh \u2013 the Playboy thing has been of great \u2013 very great concern to me. I don\u2019t know how to deal with it exactly. Uh \u2013 I uh \u2013 agreed to give the interview uh \u2013 to Playboy Other people have done it who are notable \u2013 uh \u2013 Governor Jerry Brown, uh \u2013 Walter Cronkite, uh \u2013 Albert Schweitzer, Mr. Ford\u2019s own secretary of the treasury, Mr. Simon, uh \u2013 William Buckley \u2013 many other people.

If I should ever decide in the future to discuss my \u2013 my deep Christian beliefs and uh \u2013 condemnation and sinfulness, I\u2019ll use another forum besides Playboy. But I can say this, uh \u2013 I\u2019m doing the best I can to get away from that, and during the next ten days, the American people will not see the Carter campaign running uh \u2013 television advertisements and newspaper advertisements based on a personal attack on President Ford\u2019s character. I believe that the opposite is true with President Ford\u2019s campaign, and uh \u2013 I hope that we can leave those issues in this next ten days about personalities and mistakes of the past \u2013 we\u2019ve both made some mistakes \u2013 and talk about unemployment, inflation, housing, education, taxation, government organization, stripping away of secrecy, and the things that are crucial to the American people.

They wonder how an elected representative uh \u2013 can serve them and participate in such activities uh \u2013 serving in the Congress of the United States. Yes, and I\u2019m certain many, many Americans were turned off by the revelations of Watergate, a very, very uh \u2013 bad period of time in American political history. Yes, and thousands, maybe millions of Americans were turned off because of the uh \u2013 problems that came out of our involvement in Vietnam.

Now, like uh \u2013 any hardworking uh \u2013 person seeking public office uh \u2013 in the campaign, inevitably sometimes you will use uh \u2013 rather graphic language and I\u2019m guilty of that just like I think most others in the political arena.

I said I had no recollection whatsoever of talking with any of the White House legislative liaison people. I indicated under oath that the initiative that I took was at the request of the ranking members of the House Banking and Currency Committee on the Republican side, which was a legitimate request and a proper response by me. Now that was gone into by two congressional committees, and following that investigation, both committees overwhelmingly approved me, and the House and the Senate did likewise. Now, in the meantime, the special prosecutor, within the last few days, after an investigation himself, said there was no reason for him to get involved because he found nothing that would justify it. And then just a day or two ago, the attorney general of the United States made a further investigation and came to precisely the same conclusion. Now, after all of those investigations by objective, responsible people, I think the matter is closed once and for all. But to add one other feature, I don\u2019t control any of the tapes.

I got a- a complete report back from those countries from these two distinguished \u2013 uh \u2013 gentlemen. Mr. Harriman talked to the leaders in Yugoslavia, and I think it\u2019s accurate to say that there is no uh \u2013 prospect in their opinion, of the Soviet Union invading uh \u2013 Yugoslavia should uh \u2013 Mr. Tito pass away. The present leadership uh \u2013 there is uh \u2013 is fairly uniform in \u2013 in their purpose, and I think it\u2019s a close-knit group, uh \u2013 and uh \u2013 I think it would be unwise for us to say that we will go to war uh \u2013 in Yugoslavia uh \u2013 if the Soviets should invade, which I think would be an extremely unlikely thing.

It\u2019s far better for a person sitting in the White House uh \u2013 who has a number of options to make certain that the uh \u2013 other side, so to speak, doesn\u2019t know precisely what you\u2019re going to do.

It is tragic that uh \u2013 the full transcript of that interview was not released and that there were excerpts, some of the excerpts, taken out of context. Not this one, however, that you bring up.

And I think it\u2019s the consensus of the people who are knowledgeable in the military field, that he is probably the outstanding military leader and strategist that we have in America today. Now he did use uh \u2013 ill-advised words, but I think in the fact that he apologized, that he was reprimanded, uh \u2013 does permit him to stay on and continue that kind of leadership that\u2019s we so badly need as we enter into uh \u2013 negotiations uh \u2013 under the SALT II agreement, or if we have operations that might be developing uh in the Middle East or southern Africa, in the Pacific, uh \u2013 we need a man with that experience, that knowledge, that know-how, and I think, in light of the fact that he has uh \u2013 apologized, uh \u2013 would not have justified my asking for his resignation."}

And my first organization was just four or five people plus my wife and my children, my three sons and their wives. And we won the nomination by going out into the streets \u2013 barbershops, beauty parlors, restaurants, stores, in factory shift lines also in farmers\u2019 markets and livestock sale barns \u2013 and we talked a lot and we listened a lot and we learned from the American people.

Now we have a very, very wide-ranging group of advisers who help me prepare for these debates and who teach me about international economics, and foreign affairs, defense matters, health, education, welfare, government reorganization. I\u2019d say, several hundred of them. And they\u2019re very fine and very highly qualified. The one major decision that I have made since acquiring the nomination, and I share this with President Ford, is the choice of a vice president. I think this should be indicative of the kind of leaders I would choose to help me if I am elected. I chose Senator Walter Mondale. And the only criterion I ever put forward in my own mind was who among the several million people in this country would be the best person qualified to be president, if something should happen to me and to join me in being vice president if I should serve out my term. And I\u2019m convinced now, more than I was when I got the nomination, that Walter Mondale was the right choice, And I believe this is a good indication of the kind of people I would choose in the future. Mr. Ford has had that same choice to make. I don\u2019t want to say anything critical of Senator Dole, but I\u2019ve never heard Mr. Ford say that that was his prim- primary consideration \u2013 Who is the best person I could choose in this country to be president of the United States? I feel completely at ease knowing that someday Senator Mondale might very well be president.

I don\u2019t mean to be critical of uh \u2013 Senator Mondale, but uh \u2013 I was uh \u2013 very, very surprised when I read that uh \u2013 Senator Mondale made a very derogatory, very personal comment about General Brown uh \u2013 after the news story that uh \u2013 broke about General Brown.

I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a proper way to describe aayuh- chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who has fought for his country for thirty-five years, and I\u2019m sure the governor would agree with me on that. Uh \u2013 I think Senator Dole would show more good judgment and discretion than to so describe uh \u2013 a heroic and brave and very outstanding leader of the military. So I think our selection uh \u2013 of Bob Dole as vice president uh \u2013 is based on merit.

Uh \u2013 I think it\u2019s accurate to say that the uh \u2013 strip-mining law which was passed twice by the Congress \u2013 uh \u2013 and was only like two votes I believe of being overridden \u2013 would have been good for the country. The claim that it would have put hundred and forty thousand miners out of work is uh \u2013 hard to believe, when at the time Mr. Ford vetoed it, the United Mine Workers was uh \u2013 supporting the bill. And I don\u2019t think they would have supported the uh \u2013 bill had they known that they would lose a hundred and forty thousand jobs. There\u2019s been a consistent policy on the part of this administration to lower or delay enforcement of air pollution standards and water pollution standards. And under both President Nixon and Ford, monies have been impounded that would\u2019ve gone to uh \u2013 cities and others to control uh \u2013 water pollution. We have no energy policy. We, I think, are the only developed nation in the world that has no comprehensive energy policy, to permit us to plan in an orderly way how to shift from increasing the scarce uh \u2013 energy uh \u2013 forms: oil, and have research and development concentrated on the increased use of coal, which I strongly favor. The research and development to be used primary to make the coal burning uh \u2013 be clean. We need a heritage trust program, similar to the one we had in Georgia, to set aside additional lands that have uh \u2013 geological and archeological importance, uh natural areas for enjoyment. Uh \u2013 the lands that Mr. Ford uh \u2013 brags about having approved are in Alaska and they are enormous in uh \u2013 in size. But as far as the accessibility of them by the American people, it\u2019s very uh \u2013 far in the future. We\u2019ve taken no strong position in the uh \u2013 control of pollution of our oceans, and I would say the worst uh \u2013 threat to the environment of all is nuclear proliferation. And this administration, having been in office now for two years or more, has still not taken strong and bold action to stop the proliferation of nuclear waste around the world, particularly plutonium. Those are some brief remarks about the failures of this administration. I would do the opposite in every respect."}
{"Title":"October 22, 1976 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Carter-Ford Presidential Debate","Date":214790400000,"Participants":"Carter-Ford","Moderators":"MS. WALTERS","Speaker":"MR. CARTER","Text":"Yes, I\u2019d be glad to. In the first place, uh \u2013 as is the case with the environmental policy and the energy policy that I just described, and the policy for nonproliferation of uh \u2013 of nuclear waste, this administration has no urban policy. It\u2019s impossible for mayors or governors to cooperate with the resident, because they can\u2019t anticipate what\u2019s gonna happen next. A mayor of a city like New York, for instance, needs to know uh \u2013 eighteen months or two years ahead of time what responsibility the city will have in administration and in financing \u2013 in things like housing, uh \u2013 pollution control, uh \u2013 crime control, education, welfare and health. This has not been done, unfortunately. I remember the headline in the Daily News that said, \u201cFord to New York: Drop Dead.\u201d I think it\u2019s very important that our cities know that they have a partner in the federal government. Quite often Congress has passed laws in the past designed to help people with uh \u2013 the ownership of homes and with the control of crime and with adequate health care and education programs and so forth. Uh \u2013 those uh programs were designed to help those who need it most. And quite often this has been in the very poor people and neighborhoods in the downtown urban centers. Because of the uh \u2013 great -ly- greatly uh \u2013 advantaged uh \u2013 tho- per \u2013 persons who live in the suburbs, better education, better organization, more articulate, more aware of what the laws are, quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where it\u2019s needed. Also I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care. We have now uh \u2013 for instance only 7 percent of the total education cost being financed by the federal government. When uh \u2013 the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent. That\u2019s a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contributes to education in just eight years. And as you know, the education cost has gone up uh \u2013 tremendously. The last point is that the major \u2013 uh thrust has gotta be to put people back to work. We\u2019ve got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh \u2013 particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent. And the concentration of employment opportunities in those areas would help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base, but also to help reduce the extraordinary welfare cost. One of the major responsibilities on the shoulders of uh \u2013 New York City is to \u2013 is to finance welfare. And I favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether. And over a longer period of time, let the federal government begin to absorb part of it that\u2019s now paid by the state governments. Those things would help a great deal with the cities, but we still have a \u2013 a very serious problem there."}

FORD","Text":"Let me uh \u2013 speak out very strongly. The Ford administration does have a very comprehensive program to help uh \u2013 our major metropolitan areas. I fought for, and the Congress finally went along with a general revenue sharing program, whereby cities and uh \u2013 states, uh \u2013 the cities two-thirds and the states one-third, get over six billion dollars a year in cash through which they can uh \u2013 provide many, many services, whatever they really want. In addition we uh \u2013 in the federal government make available to uh \u2013 cities about uh \u2013 three billion three hundred million dollars in what we call community development. In adesh- in addition, uh \u2013 uh \u2013 as a result of my pressure an the Congress, we got a major mass transit program uh \u2013 over a four-year period, eleven billion eight-hundred million dollars. We have a good housing program, uh \u2013 that uh \u2013 will result in cutting uh \u2013 the down payments by 50 percent and uh \u2013 having mortgage payments uh lower at the beginning of any mortgage period. We\u2019re expanding our homestead uh \u2013 housing program. The net result is uh \u2013 we think under Carla Hills, who\u2019s the chairman of my uh \u2013 urban development and uh \u2013 neighborhood revitalization program, we will really do a first-class job in helping uh \u2013 the communities throughout the country. As a matter of fact, that committee under Secretary Hills released about a seventy-five-page report with specific recommendations so we can do a better job uh \u2013 the weeks ahead. And in addition, the tax program of the Ford administration, which provides an incentive for industry to move into our major uh \u2013 metropolitan areas, into the inner cities, will bring jobs where people are, and help to revitalize those cities as they can be."}
{"Title":"October 22, 1976 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Carter-Ford Presidential Debate","Date":214790400000,"Participants":"Carter-Ford","Moderators":"MS. WALTERS","Speaker":"MR. FORD","Text":"Let me say at the outset, uh \u2013 I\u2019m very proud of the record of this administration. In the cabinet I have one of the outstanding, I think, administrators as the secretary of transportation, Bill Coleman. You\u2019re familiar, I\u2019m sure, with the recognition given in the Air Force to uh \u2013 General James, and there was just uh \u2013 approved a three-star admiral, the first in the history of the United States Navy, so uh \u2013 we are giving full recognition to individuals of quality in the Ford administration in positions of great responsibility. In addition, uh \u2013 the Department of Justice is fully enforcing, and enforcing effectively, the Voting Rights Act, the legislation that involves jobs, housing for minorities, not only blacks but all others. Uh \u2013 the Department of uh \u2013 uh \u2013 HUD is enforcing the new legislation that uhh \u2013 outlaws, that takes care of redlining. Uh \u2013 what we\u2019re doing is saying that there are opportunities, business opportunities, educational opportunities, responsibilities uh \u2013 where people with talent, black or any other minority, can fully qualify. The Office of Minority Business in the Department of Commerce has made available more money in trying to help uh \u2013 black businessmen or other minority businessmen than any other administration since the office was established. The Office of Small Business, under Mr. Kobelinski, has a very massive program trying to help the black community. The individual who wants to start a business or expand his business as a black businessman is able to borrow, either directly or with guaranteed loans. I believe on the record that this administration has been more responsive and we have carried out the law to the letter, and I\u2019m proud of the record."}

CARTER","Text":"The uh \u2013 description just made of this administration\u2019s record is hard to uh \u2013 recognize. I think it\u2019s accurate to say that Mr. Ford voted against the uh \u2013 Voting Rights Acts and the uh \u2013 Civil Rights Acts in their uh \u2013 debative stage I think once it was assured they were going to pass he finally voted for it. This country uh \u2013 changed drastically in 1969 when the uh \u2013 terms of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were over and Richard Nixon and \u2013 and Gerald Ford became the presidents. There was a time when there was hope for those who uh \u2013 were poor and downtrodden and who were \u2013 uh elderly or who were \u2013 uh ill or who were in minority groups, but that time has been gone. I think the greatest thing that ever happened to the South was the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the opening up of opportunities \u2013 uh to black people \u2013 the chance to vote, to hold a job, to buy a house, to go to school, and to participate in public affairs. It not only liberated \u2013 uh black people but it also liberated the whites. We\u2019ve seen uh \u2013 in many instances in recent years a minority affairs uh \u2013 section of uh Small Loan Administration, uh \u2013 Small Business Administration lend uh \u2013 a black entrepreneur just enough money to get started, and then to go bankrupt. The bankruptcies have gone up \u2013 uh in an extraordinary degree. Uh \u2013 FHA, which used to be a very responsible agency, uh \u2013 that everyone looked to to help own a home, lost six million dollars last year. There\u2019ve been over thirteen hundred indictments in HUD, over eight hundred convictions relating just to home loans. And now the federal government has become the world\u2019s greatest slum landlord. We\u2019ve got a 30 percent or 40 percent unemployment rate among minority uh \u2013 young people. And there\u2019s been no concerted effort given to the needs of those who are both poor and black, or poor and who speak a foreign language. And that\u2019s where there\u2019s been a great uh generation of despair, and ill health, and the lack of education, lack of purposefulness, and the lack of hope for the future. But it doesn\u2019t take just a quiet uh \u2013 dormant uh minimum enforcement of the law. It requires an aggressive searching out and reaching out to help people who especially need it. And that\u2019s been lacking in the last eight years."}

CARTER","Text":"I would not work hard to support any of those. Uh \u2013 we\u2019ve always had, I think, a lot of constitutional amendments proposed, but the passage of them has been uh \u2013 fairly slow, and uh \u2013 few and far between. In the two-hundred-year history there\u2019s been a very uh \u2013 cautious approach to this. We \u2013 quite often we have a transient problem. I \u2013 I\u2019m strongly against a- abortion. I think abortion\u2019s wrong. I don\u2019t think the government oughta do anything to encourage abortion. But I don\u2019t favor a constitutional amendment on the subject. But short of the constitutional amendment, and within the confines of the Supreme Court rulings, I\u2019ll do everything I can to minimize the need for abortions with better sex education, family planning, with better adoptive procedures. I personally don\u2019t believe that the federal government oughta finance abortions, but I \u2013 I draw the line and don\u2019t support a constitutional amendment. However, I honor the right of people who seek the constitutional amendments on school busing, on uh \u2013 prayer in the schools and an abortion. But among those you named, I won\u2019t actively work for the passage of any of them."}

WALTERS","Speaker":"MR.FORD","Text":"support the uh \u2013 Republican uh \u2013 platform, which calls for the constitutional amendment that would uh \u2013 outlaw abortions. I favor the particular constitutional amendment that would turn over to the states the uh \u2013 individual right to the voters in those states uh \u2013 the chance to make a decision by public referendum. Uh I call that the people amendment. I think if you really believe that the people of a state ought to make a decision on a matter of this kind that uh \u2013 we ought to have a federal constitutional amendment that would permit each one of the fifty states to make the choice. Uh \u2013 I think this is a responsible and a proper way to proceed. Uhh \u2013 I believe also that uh \u2013 there is some merit to a \u2013 an amendment that uh \u2013 uh \u2013 Senator Everett Dirksen uh \u2013 proposed very frequently, an amendment that would uh \u2013 change the court decision as far as voluntary prayer in public schools. Uh \u2013 it seems to me that there should have \u2013 be an opportunity, uh \u2013 as long as it\u2019s voluntary, as long as there is no uh \u2013 compulsion whatsoever, that uh \u2013 an individual ought to have that right. So in those two cases I think uh \u2013 such uh \u2013 a constitutional amendment would be proper, and I really don\u2019t think in either case they\u2019re trivial matters. I think they\u2019re matters of very deep conviction, as far as many, many people in this country believe. And therefore, they shouldn\u2019t be treated lightly. But they\u2019re matters that are ah \u2013 important. And in those two cases, I would favor them."}
{"Title":"October 22, 1976 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Carter-Ford Presidential Debate","Date":214790400000,"Participants":"Carter-Ford","Moderators":"MS. WALTERS","Speaker":"MR. FORD","Text":"Uh \u2013 Mr. Maynard, uh \u2013 the record of gun control, whether it\u2019s one city or another or in some states, does not show that the registration of a gun, handgun, or the registration of the gun owner, has in any way whatsoever decreased the crime rate or the use of that gun in the committing of a crime. The record just doesn\u2019t prove that such legislation or action by a local city council is effective. What we have to do, and this is the crux of the matter, is to make it very, very uh \u2013 difficult for a person who uses a gun in the commission of a crime to stay out of jail. If we make the use of a gun in the commission. of a crime a serious criminal offense, and that person is prosecuted, then, in my opinion, we are going after the person who uses the gun for the wrong reason. I don\u2019t believe in the registration of handguns or the registration of the handgun owner. That has not proven to be effective, and therefore, I think the better way is to go after the criminal, the individual who commits a crime in the possession of a gun and uses that gun for a part of his criminal activity. Those are the people who ought to be in jail. And the only way to do it is to pass strong legislation so that once apprehended, indicted, convicted, they\u2019ll be in jail and off the streets and not using guns in the commission of a crime."}

And uh \u2013 the individuals that uh \u2013 with whom I\u2019ve consulted have not uh \u2013 convinced me that uh \u2013 a national registration of handguns or handgun owners will solve the problem you\u2019re talking about. The person who wants to use a gun for an illegal purpose can get it whether it\u2019s registered or outlawed. They will be obtained. And they are the people who ought to go behind bars. You should not in the process penalize the legitimate handgun owner. And when you go through the process of registration, you in effect, are penalizing that individual who uses his gun for a very legitimate purpose."}

Uh \u2013 earlier, uh \u2013 Mr. Levi, his uh \u2013 attorney general, put forward a gun control proposal, which Mr. Ford later, I believe, espoused, that called for the prohibition against the uh sale aw- of the uh \u2013 so-called Saturday Night Specials. And it would\u2019ve put uh \u2013 very strict uh \u2013 uh \u2013 control over who owned a handgun. I have been a hunter all my life and happen to own both shotguns, rifles, and a handgun. And uh \u2013 the only purpose that I would see in registering uh \u2013 handguns and not long guns of any kind would be to prohibit the uh \u2013 ownership of those guns by those who\u2019ve used them in the commission of a crime, or who uh \u2013 have been proven to be mentally incompetent to own a gun. I believe that limited approach to the \u2013 to the question would be uh \u2013 advisable, and \u2013 and I think, adequate. But that\u2019s as far as I would go with it."}
{"Title":"October 22, 1976 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Carter-Ford Presidential Debate","Date":214790400000,"Participants":"Carter-Ford","Moderators":"MS. WALTERS","Speaker":"MR. CARTER","Text":"While I was governor of Georgia, although I\u2019m not a lawyer, we had complete reform of the Georgia court system. We uh \u2013 streamlined the structure of the court, put in administrative officers, put a unified court system in, required that all uh \u2013 severe sentences be reviewed far uniformity. And, in addition to that put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office of selection of \u2013 for all judges and district attorneys or prosecuting attorneys, on the basis of merit. Every time I had a vacancy on the Georgia Supreme Court \u2013 and I filled five of those vacancies out of seven total and about half the court of appeals judges, about 35 percent of the trial judges \u2013 I was given from an objective panel the five most highly qualified persons in Georgia. And from those five, I always chose the first one or second one. So merit selection of judges is the most important single criterion. And I would institute the same kind of procedure as president, not only in judicial appointments, but also in diplomatic appointments. Secondly, I think that the Burger Court has fairly well confirmed the major and \u2013 and most far-reaching and most controversial decisions of the Warren Court. Civil rights \u2013 uh has been confirmed by the Burger Court, hasn\u2019t been uh \u2013 reversed, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any inclination to reverse those basic decisions. The one-man, one-vote rule, which is a very important one that uh \u2013 s- struck down the unwarranted influence in the legislature of parsley \u2013 uh populated areas of \u2013 of the states. The uh \u2013 right of indigent or very poor accused persons to uh \u2013 legal counsel. Uh \u2013 I think the Burger Court has confirmed that basic and very controversial decision of the Warren Court. Also the \u2013 the protection of an arrested person against unwarranted persecution in trying to get a false uh \u2013 confession. But now I think there have been a couple of instances where the Burger Court has made technical rulings where an obviously guilty person was later found to be guilty. And I think that in that case uh \u2013 some of the more liberal uh \u2013 members of the uh \u2013 so-called Warren Court agreed with those decisions. But the only uh \u2013 thing I uh \u2013 have pointed out was, what I\u2019ve just said, and that there was a need to clarify the technicalities so that you couldn\u2019t be forced to release a person who was obviously guilty just because of a \u2013 of a small technicality in the law. And \u2013 and that\u2019s a reversal of position uh by the Burger Court with which I do agree."}

Once the uh \u2013 search and analysis procedure had been completed, and once I\u2019m given a list of the five or seven or ten uh \u2013 best qualified persons in the country, I would make a selection from among those uh \u2013 persons. If the uh \u2013 list was, uh \u2013 in my opinion, fairly uniform, if there was no outstanding person, then I would undoubtedly choose someone who would most accurately reflect my own basic politi- political philosophy as best I could determine it. Which would be uh \u2013 to continue the progress that has been made under the last two uh \u2013 courts \u2013 the Warren Court and the Burger Court. I would also like to uh \u2013 completely revise our criminal justice system \u2013 to do some of the things at the federal level in court reform that I\u2019ve just described, as has been done in Georgia and other states. And then I would like to appoint people who would be interested in helping with that. I know that uh Chief Justice Burger is. He hasn\u2019t had help from the administration, from the Congress, to carry this out. The uh \u2013 emphasis, I think, of the \u2013 of the court system uh \u2013 should be to interpret the uh \u2013 the Constitution and the laws uh \u2013 equally between property protection and personal protection. But when there\u2019s uh \u2013 a very narrow decision \u2013 which quite often there\u2019s one that reaches the Supreme Court \u2013 I think the choice should be with human rights.

I had one opportunity to nominate uh \u2013 an individual to the Supreme Court and I selected the Circuit Court of Appeals judge from Illinois, uh \u2013 John Paul Stevens. I selected him because of his outstanding record as a Circuit Court of Appeals Judge, and I was very pleased that uh \u2013 an overwhelming Democratic United States Senate, after going into his background, came to the conclusion that he was uh \u2013 fit and should serve, and the vote in his behalf was overwhelming. So, I would say somebody in the format of uh \u2013 Justice Stevens would be the kind of an individual that I would uh \u2013 select in the future, as I did him in the past. I uh \u2013 believe, however, a comment ought to be made about the direction of the uh \u2013 Burger Court, vis-a-vis the uh \u2013 court uh \u2013 that preceded it. It seems to me that the Miranda case was a case that really made it very, very difficult for the \u2013 uh police, the law enforcement people in this country to uh \u2013 do what they could to make certain that the victim of a crime was protected and that those that commit crimes uh \u2013 were properly handled and uh \u2013 sent to jail. The Miranda case, uh \u2013 the Burger Court uh \u2013 is gradually changing, and I\u2019m pleased to see that there are some steps being made by the uh \u2013 Burger Court to modify the so-called Miranda decision. Uh \u2013 I might make a correction uh \u2013 of what uh \u2013 Governor Carter said, uh speaking of uh \u2013 uh \u2013 gun control, uh \u2013 yes, it is true, I believe that the sale of uh \u2013 Saturday Night S- Specials should be cut out, but he wants the registration of handguns."}

Uh \u2013 let me uh \u2013 talk about uh \u2013 the economic announcements that were made just this past week. Yes, it was announced that the uh \u2013 GNP real growth in the third quarter was at 4 percent. But do you realize that over the last ten years that\u2019s a higher figure than the average growth during that ten-year period? Now it\u2019s lower than the nine-point-point-two percent growth in the first quarter, and it\u2019s lower than the uh 5 percent growth in the second quarter. But every economist \u2013 liberal, conservative that I\u2019m familiar with \u2013 recognizes that in the fourth quarter of this year and in the fifth quar- uh \u2013 the first quarter of next year that we\u2019ll have an increase in real GNP. But now let\u2019s talk about the pluses that came out this week. We had an 18 percent increase in housing starts. We had a substantial increase in new permits for housing. As a matter of fact, based on the announcement this week, there will be at an annual rate of a million, eight hundred and some thousand new houses built, which is a tremendous increase over last year and a substantial increase over the earlier part of this year. Now in addition, we had a very \u2013 some very good news in the reduction in the rate of inflation. And inflation hits everybody: those who are working and those who are on welfare. The rate of inflation, as announced just the other day, is under 5 percent; and the uh \u2013 4.4 percent that was indicated at the time of the 4 percent GNP was less than the 5.4 percent. It means that the American buyer is getting a better bargain today because inflation is less."}

We\u2019ve got seven and a half million people out of jobs. Since he\u2019s been in office, two and a half million more American people have lost their jobs. In the last four months alone, five hundred thousand Americans have gone on the unemployment roll. In the last month, we\u2019ve had a net loss of one hundred and sixty-three thousand jobs. Anybody who says that the inflation rate is in good shape now ought to talk to the housewives. One of the overwhelming results that I\u2019ve seen in the polls is that people feel that you can\u2019t plan anymore. There\u2019s no way to make a prediction that my family might be able to own a home or to put my kid through college. Savings accounts are losing money instead of gaining money. Inflation is robbing us. Under the present administration \u2013 Nixon\u2019s and Ford\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve had three times the inflation rate that we experienced under President Johnson and President Kennedy. The economic growth is less than half today what it was at the beginning of this year. And housing starts \u2013 he compares the housing starts with last year. I don\u2019t blame him, because in 1975 we had fewer housing starts in this country, fewer homes built, than any year since 1940. That\u2019s thirty-five years. And we\u2019ve got a 35 percent unemployment rate in many areas of this country among construction workers. And Mr. Ford hasn\u2019t done anything about it. And I think this shows a callous indifference to the families that have suffered so much. He has vetoed bills passed by Congress within the congressional budget guidelines job opportunities for two million Americans. We\u2019ll never have a balanced budget, we\u2019ll never meet the needs of our people, we\u2019ll never control the inflationary spiral, as long as we have seven and a half or eight million people out of work, who are looking for jobs. And we\u2019ve probably got two and a half more million people who are not looking for jobs any more, because they\u2019ve given up hope. That is a very serious indictment of this administration. It\u2019s probably the worst one of all."}

CARTER","Text":"Well, that\u2019s not exactly an accurate description of what happened. When I was that far ahead, it was immediately following the Democratic Convention, and before the Republican Convention. At that time, uh \u2013 25 or 30 percent of the Reagan supporters said that they would not support President Ford. But as occurred at the end of the con- Democratic Convention, the Republican Party unified itself. And I think immediately following the Republican Convention, there was about a ten-point spread. I believe that to be accurate, I had 49 percent; President Ford, 39 percent. Uh \u2013 the polls uh \u2013 are good indications of fluctuations, but they vary widely one from another. And the only poll I\u2019ve ever followed is the one that uh \u2013 you know, is taken on election day. I was in uh \u2013 thirty primaries in the spring, and uh \u2013 at first it was obvious that I didn\u2019t have any standing in the poll. As a matter of fact, I think when Gallup ran their first poll in December of 1975 they didn\u2019t put my name on the list. They had thirty-five people on the list. My name wasn\u2019t even there. And at the beginning of the year I had about 2 percent. So the polls to me are interesting, but they don\u2019t determine, you know, my hopes or \u2013 or my despair. I campaign among people. I\u2019ve never depended on powerful political figures to put me in office. I have a direct relationship with hundreds of people around \u2013 hundreds of thousands around the country who actively campaign for me. In Georgia alone, for instance, I got 84 percent of the vote, and I think there were fourteen people uh \u2013 in addition to myself on the ballot, and Governor Wallace had been very strong in Georgia. That\u2019s an overwhelming support from my own people who know me best. And today, we have about five hundred Georgians at their own expense \u2013 just working people who believe in me \u2013 spread around the country uh \u2013 involved in the political campaign. So, the polls are interesting, but uh \u2013 I don\u2019t know how to explain the fluctuation. I think a lot of it uh \u2013 depends on current events \u2013 uh \u2013 sometimes foreign affairs, sometimes domestic affairs. But I think our hold uh \u2013 of support among those who uh \u2013 are crucial to the election has been fairly steady. And my success in the primary season was, I think, notable for a newcomer, from someone who\u2019s from outside Washington, who \u2013 who never has been a part of the Washington establishment. And I think that we\u2019ll have good results uh \u2013 on November the second for myself and I hope for the country."}

FORD","Text":"I think uh \u2013 the uh \u2013 increase and the uh \u2013 prospects as far as I\u2019m concerned and the I \u2013 less favorable prospects for Governor Carter, reflect that Governor Carter uh \u2013 is inconsistent in many of the positions that he takes. He tends to distort on a number of occasions. Uh \u2013 just a moment ago, for example, uh \u2013 he uh \u2013 was indicating that uh \u2013 uh \u2013 in the 1950s, for example, uh \u2013 unemployment was very low. He fails to point out that uh \u2013 in the 1950s we were engaged in the war in Vietnam. We \u2013 I mean in Korea \u2013 we had uh \u2013 three million five hundred thousand young men uh \u2013 in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines. That\u2019s not the way to end unemployment or to reduce unemployment. At the present time we\u2019re at peace. We have reduced the number of people in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines from three million, one hundred \u2013 three million, five hundred thousand to two mil- lion one hundred thousand. We are not at war. We have reduced the military manpower by a million four hundred thousand. If we had that many more people in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and Marines, our unemployment figure would be considerably less. But this administration doesn\u2019t believe the way to reduce unemployment is to go to war, or to increase the number of people in the military. So you cannot compare unemployment, as you sought to, uh \u2013 with the present time with the 1950s, because the then administration had people in the military \u2013 they were at war, they were fighting overseas, and this administration has reduced the size of the military by a million four hundred thousand. They\u2019re in the civilian labor market and they\u2019re not fighting anywhere around the world today."}

FORD","Text":"For twenty-five years I served in the Congress under five presidents. I saw them work, I saw them make very hard decisions. I didn\u2019t always agree with their decisions, whether they were Democratic or Republican presidents. For the last two years, I\u2019ve been the president, and I have found from experience that it\u2019s much more difficult to make those decisions than it is to second-guess them. I became president at the time that the United States was in a very troubled time. We had inflation of over 12 percent, we were on the brink of the worst recession in the last forty years, we were still deeply involved in the problems of Vietnam. The American people had lost faith and trust and confidence in the presidency itself. That uh \u2013 situation called for me to first put the United States on a steady course and to keep our keel well balanced, because we had to face the difficult problems that had all of a sudden hit America. I think most people know that I did not seek the presidency. But I am asking for your help and assistance to be president for the next four years. During this campaign we\u2019ve seen a lot of television shows, a lot of bumper stickers, and a great many uh \u2013 slogans of one kind or another. But those are not the things that count. What counts is, that the United States celebrated its 200th birthday on July fourth. As a result of that wonderful experience all over the United States, there is a new spirit in America. The American people are healed, are working together. The American people are moving again, and moving in the right direction. We have cut inflation by better than half. We have came out of the recession and we\u2019re well on the road to real prosperity in this country again. There has been a restoration of faith and confidence and trust in the presidency because I\u2019ve been open, candid and forthright. I have never promised more than I could produce and I have produced everything that I promised. We are at peace. Not a single young American is fighting or dying on any foreign soil tonight. We have peace with freedom. I\u2019ve been proud to be president of the United States during these very troubled times. I love America just as all of you love America. It would be the highest honor for me to have your support on November second and for you to say, \u201cJerry Ford, you\u2019ve done a good job, keep on doing it.\u201d Thank you, and good night."}

CARTER","Text":"Thank you Barbara (barely audible). The major purpose of an election for president is to choose a leader. Someone who can analyze the depths of feeling in our country to set a standard for our people to follow, to inspire our people to reach for greatness, to correct our defects, to answer difficult questions, to bind ourselves together in a spirit of unity. I don\u2019t believe the present administration has done that. We have been discouraged and we\u2019ve been alienated. Sometimes we\u2019ve been embarrassed and sometimes we\u2019ve been ashamed. Our people are out of work, and there\u2019s a sense of withdrawal. But our country is innately very strong. Mr. Ford is a good and decent man, but he\u2019s in \u2013 been in office now more than eight hundred days approaching almost as long as John Kennedy was in office. I\u2019d like to ask the American people what, what\u2019s been accomplished. A lot remains to be done. My own background is different from his. I was a school board member, and a library board member. I served an a hospital authority. And I was in the state senate and I was governor and I\u2019m an engineer, a Naval officer, a farmer, a businessman. And I believe we require someone who can work harmoniously with the Congress, who can work closely with the people of this country, and who can bring a new image and a new spirit to Washington. Our tax structure is a disgrace, it needs to be reformed. I was Governor of Georgia for four years. We never increased sales taxes or income tax or property tax. As a matter of fact, the year before I went out of office we gave a $50 million refund to the property taxpayers of Georgia. We spend six hundred dollars per person in this country \u2013 every man, woman and child \u2013 for health care. We still rank fifteenth among all the nations of the world in infant mortality. And our cancer rate is uh \u2013 higher than any country in the world. We don\u2019t have good health care. We could have it. Employment ought to be restored to our people. We\u2019ve become almost a welfare state. We spend now 700 percent more on unemployment compensation than we did eight years ago when the Republicans took over the White House. Our people wanna go back to work. Our education system can be improved. Secrecy ought to be stripped away from government and a maximum of personal privacy ought to be maintained. Our housing programs have uh \u2013 gone bad. It used to be that the average \u2013 uh family could own a house. But now less than a third of our people can afford to buy their own homes. The budget was more grossly out of balance last year than ever before in the history of our country \u2013 $65 billion \u2013 primarily because our people are not at work. Inflation is robbing us, as we\u2019ve already discussed, and the government bureaucracy is uh \u2013 just a horrible mess. This doesn\u2019t have to be. Now I don\u2019t know all the answers. Nobody could. But I do know that if the president of the United States and the Congress of the United States and the people of the United States said, \u201cI believe our nation is greater than what we are now.\u201d I believe that if we are inspired, if we can achieve a degree of unity, if we can set our goals high enough and work toward recognized goals with industry and labor and agriculture along with government at all levels, then we can achieve great things. We might have to do it slowly. There are no magic answers to do it. But I believe together we can make great progress. We can correct our difficult mistakes and answer those very tough questions. I believe in the greatness of our country, and I believe the American people are ready for a change in Washington. We\u2019ve been drifting too long. We\u2019ve been dormant too long. We\u2019ve been discouraged too long. And we have not set an example for our own people. But I believe that we can now establish in the White House a good relationship with Congress, a good relationship with our people, set very high goals for our country. And with inspiration and hard work we can achieve great things. And let the world know \u2013 that\u2019s very important. But more importantly, let the people in our own country realize that we still live in the greatest nation on earth. Thank you very much."}
{"Title":"September 26, 1960 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Kennedy-Nixon Presidential Debate","Date":-292377600000,"Participants":"Kennedy-Nixon","Moderators":"HOWARD K. SMITH","Speaker":"SENATOR KENNEDY","Text":"Mr. Smith, Mr. Nixon. In the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln said the question was whether this nation could exist half-slave or half-free. In the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half-slave or half-free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, in the direction of the road that we are taking, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery. I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain. We discuss tonight domestic issues, but I would not want that to be any implication to be given that this does not involve directly our struggle with Mr. Khrushchev for survival. Mr. Khrushchev is in New York, and he maintains the Communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the Soviet Union itself. The Chinese Communists have always had a large population. But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country. The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom. If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if we\u2019re moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world. If we fail, then freedom fails. Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do? Are we as strong as we should be? Are we as strong as we must be if we\u2019re going to maintain our independence, and if we\u2019re going to maintain and hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to us for assistance, to those who look to us for survival? I should make it very clear that I do not think we\u2019re doing enough, that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we\u2019re making. This is a great country, but I think it could be a greater country; and this is a powerful country, but I think it could be a more powerful country. I\u2019m not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel-mill capacity unused. I\u2019m not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world. Because economic growth means strength and vitality; it means we\u2019re able to sustain our defenses; it means we\u2019re able to meet our commitments abroad. I\u2019m not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food \u2013 some of it rotting \u2013 even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual. I saw cases in West Virginia, here in the United States, where children took home part of their school lunch in order to feed their families because I don\u2019t think we\u2019re meeting our obligations toward these Americans. I\u2019m not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are. I\u2019m not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part-time shifts. I think we should have an educational system second to none. I\u2019m not satisfied when I see men like Jimmy Hoffa \u2013 in charge of the largest union in the United States \u2013 still free. I\u2019m not satisfied when we are failing to develop the natural resources of the United States to the fullest. Here in the United States, which developed the Tennessee Valley and which built the Grand Coulee and the other dams in the Northwest United States at the present rate of hydropower production \u2013 and that is the hallmark of an industrialized society \u2013 the Soviet Union by 1975 will be producing more power than we are. These are all the things, I think, in this country that can make our society strong, or can mean that it stands still. I\u2019m not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights. If a Negro baby is born \u2013 and this is true also of Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in some of our cities \u2013 he has about one-half as much chance to get through high school as a white baby. He has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student. He has about a third as much chance to be a professional man, about half as much chance to own a house. He has about uh \u2013 four times as much chance that he\u2019ll be out of work in his life as the white baby. I think we can do better. I don\u2019t want the talents of any American to go to waste. I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government. I don\u2019t at all. I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities. And I want the states to meet their responsibilities. But I think there is also a national responsibility. The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty-five years. The people of the United States individually could not have developed the Tennessee Valley; collectively they could have. A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so. Seventeen million Americans, who live over sixty-five on an average Social Security check of about seventy-eight dollars a month, they\u2019re not able to sustain themselves individually, but they can sustain themselves through the social security system. I don\u2019t believe in big government, but I believe in effective governmental action. And I think that\u2019s the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom. It\u2019s the only way that we\u2019re going to move ahead. I think we can do a better job. I think we\u2019re going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us. We cannot turn the job over to anyone else. If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails. And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country. The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States. Because they felt that the American society was moving again. I want us to recapture that image. I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how we\u2019re doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese Communists. That is the obligation upon our generation. In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt said in his inaugural that this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny. I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous. The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack \u2013 attack it has ever known? I think it can be. And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here. I think it\u2019s time America started moving again."}
{"Title":"September 26, 1960 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Kennedy-Nixon Presidential Debate","Date":-292377600000,"Participants":"Kennedy-Nixon","Moderators":"HOWARD K. SMITH","Speaker":"MR. NIXON","Text":"Mr. Smith, Senator Kennedy. The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with. There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position. There is no question but that this nation cannot stand still; because we are in a deadly competition, a competition not only with the men in the Kremlin, but the men in Peking. We\u2019re ahead in this competition, as Senator Kennedy, I think, has implied. But when you\u2019re in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead. And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the United States should move ahead. Where, then, do we disagree? I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still. We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world. Now last year, of course, was 1958. That happened to be a recession year. But when we look at the growth of G.N.P. this year, a year of recovery, we find that it\u2019s six and nine-tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today. More about that later. Looking then to this problem of how the United States should move ahead and where the United States is moving, I think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner: Let\u2019s look at the record. Is the United States standing still? Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation? Is it true that, as far as this country is concerned, in the field of electric power, in all of the fields that he has mentioned, we have not been moving ahead. Well, we have a comparison that we can make. We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration. When we compare these two records in the areas that Senator Kennedy has \u2013 has discussed tonight, I think we find that America has been moving ahead. Let\u2019s take schools. We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years. Let\u2019s take hydroelectric power. We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history. Let us take hospitals. We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration. The same is true of highways. Let\u2019s put it in terms that all of us can understand. We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven years. That shows that there\u2019s been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor. But let\u2019s not put it there; let\u2019s put it in terms of the average family. What has happened to you? We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration. What about the prices you pay? We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration. What\u2019s the net result of this? This means that the average family income went up fifteen per cent in the Eisenhower years as against two per cent in the Truman years. Now, this is not standing still. But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isn\u2019t enough. A record is never something to stand on. It\u2019s something to build on. And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress. And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way. Senator Kennedy has suggested that he believes he knows the way. I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion. But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new. They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it. And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then. What kind of programs are we for? We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people. We are for programs, in addition, which will see that our medical care for the aged are \u2013 is \u2013 are much \u2013 is much better handled than it is at the present time. Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims. We both want to help the old people. We want to see that they do have adequate medical care. The question is the means. I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates. I could give better examples, but for \u2013 for whatever it is, whether it\u2019s in the field of housing, or health, or medical care, or schools, or the eh- development of electric power, we have programs which we believe will move America, move her forward and build on the wonderful record that we have made over these past seven and a half years. Now, when we look at these programs, might I suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much you\u2019re spending. I will concede that in all the areas to which I have referred Senator Kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than I would have it spend. I costed out the cost of the Democratic platform. It runs a minimum of thirteen and two-tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than we\u2019re presently spending. Now the Republican platform will cost more too. It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than we\u2019re presently spending. Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours? Not at all. Because it isn\u2019t a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn\u2019t a question of which government does the most. It is a question of which administration does the right thing. And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans. I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress. The final point that I would like to make is this: Senator Kennedy has suggested in his speeches that we lack compassion for the poor, for the old, and for others that are unfortunate. Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere. I know what it means to be poor. I know what it means to see people who are unemployed. I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals."}

Mr. Nixon comes out of the Republican party. He was nominated by it. And it is a fact that through most of these last twenty-five years the Republican leadership has opposed federal aid for education, medical care for the aged, development of the Tennessee Valley, development of our natural resources.

First, after each of my foreign trips I have made recommendations that have been adopted. For example, after my first trip abroad \u2013 abroad, I strongly recommended that we increase our exchange programs particularly as they related to exchange of persons of leaders in the labor field and in the information field. After my trip to South America, I made recommendations that a separate inter-American lending agency be set up which the South American nations would like much better than a lend- than to participate in the lending agencies which treated all the countries of the world the same. Uh \u2013 I have made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian refugee situation which were adopted, not only by the President but some of them were enacted into law by the Congress. Within the Administration, as a chairman of the President\u2019s Committee on Price Stability and Economic Growth, I have had the opportunity to make recommendations which have been adopted within the Administration and which I think have been reasonably effective.

You \u2013 Mr. Truman came to office in nineteen uh \u2013 forty-four and at the end of the war, and uh \u2013 difficulties that were facing the United States during that period of transition \u2013 1946 when price controls were lifted \u2013 so it\u2019s rather difficult to use an overall figure taking those seven and a half years and comparing them to the last eight years. I prefer to take the overall percentage record of the last twenty years of the Democrats and the eight years of the Republicans to show an overall period of growth. In regard to uh \u2013 price stability uh \u2013 I\u2019m not aware that that committee did produce recommendations that ever were certainly before the Congress from the point of view of legislation in regard to controlling prices. In regard to the exchange of students and labor unions, I am chairman of the subcommittee on Africa and I think that one of the most unfortunate phases of our policy towards that country was the very minute number of exchanges that we had. I think it\u2019s true of Latin America also. We did come forward with a program of students for the Congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of Africa the previous year, so that I don\u2019t think that uh \u2013 we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor."}

SMITH","Speaker":"MR. KENNEDY","Text":"Well, because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh \u2013 then I think you would have complete uh \u2013 economic chaos. The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall. There are hundreds of thousands of them. They really don\u2019t \u2013 they\u2019re not able to control their market very well. They bring their crops in or their livestock in, many of them about the same time. They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs \u2013 a few large companies in many cases \u2013 and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place. I think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture. And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse. The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States. The automobile industry is the number one market for steel. So if the farmers\u2019 economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country. So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one. Secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance. The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh \u2013 surpluses \u2013 nine billion dollars worth. We\u2019ve had a uh \u2013 higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years. I think that this farm policy has failed. In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance. And that can only be done through governmental action. I therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported, that the federal government, after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity, attempt to bring supply and demand into balance \u2013 attempt effective production controls \u2013 so that we won\u2019t have that five or six per cent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent. I think Mr. Benson\u2019s program has failed. And I must say, after reading the Vice President\u2019s speech before the farmers, as he read mine, I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s very much different from Mr. Benson\u2019s. I don\u2019t think it provides effective governmental controls. I think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years, which was Mr. Benson\u2019s theory. I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future."}

Uh \u2013 I would also suggest that insofar as his statement is concerned, that I think it would be improper for the President of the United States to disclose uh \u2013 the instances in which members of his official family had made recommendations, as I have made them through the years to him, which he has accepted or rejected. The President has always maintained and very properly so that he is entitled to get what advice he wants from his cabinet and from his other advisers without disclosing that to anybody \u2013 including as a matter of fact the Congress. Now, I can only say this. Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council. I have been in the cabinet. I have met with the legislative leaders. I have met with the President when he made the great decisions with regard to Lebanon, Quemoy and Matsu, other matters. The President has asked for my advice. I have given it. Sometimes my advice has been taken. Sometimes it has not. I do not say that I have made the decisions. And I would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decisions, The president only makes the decisions. All that his advisers do is to give counsel when he asks for it. As far as what experience counts and whether that is experience that counts, that isn\u2019t for me to say. Uh \u2013 I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider; Senator Kennedy\u2019s is there for the people to consider. As he pointed out, we came to the Congress in the same year. His experience has been different from mine. Mine has been in the executive branch. His has been in the legislative branch. I would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and I think both he and I are going to abide by whatever the people decide."}

SMITH","Speaker":"MR. KENNEDY","Text":"\u2013 reducing the interest rate. In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960. What I have talked about, however, the kind of programs that I\u2019ve talked about, in my judgment, are uh \u2013 fiscally sound. Medical care for the aged, I would put under social security. The Vice President and I disagree on this. The program \u2013 the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon-Javits program \u2013 would have cost, if fully used uh \u2013 six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state. The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security, and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax. Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers\u2019 salaries. I think that\u2019s a good investment. I think we\u2019re going to have to do it. And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated. There is no greater return to an economy or to a society than an educational system second to none. On the question of the development of natural resources, I would pay as you go in the sense that they would be balanced and the power revenues would bring back sufficient money to finance the projects, in the same way as the Tennessee Valley. I believe in the balanced budget. And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession. Otherwise, with a steady rate of economic growth \u2013 and Mr. Nixon and Mr. Rockefeller, in their meeting, said a five per cent economic growth would bring by 1962 ten billion dollars extra in tax revenues. Whatever is brought in, I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget, if business remains orderly."}

SMITH","Speaker":"MR. NIXON","Text":"Yes. I think what Mr. Novins was referring to was not one of Senator Kennedy\u2019s speeches, but the Democratic platform, which did mention cutting the national debt. I think, too, that it should be pointed out that of course it is not possible, particularly under the proposals that Senator Kennedy has advocated, either to cut the national debt or to reduce taxes. As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes. As Senator Kennedy points out that as far as his one proposal is concerned \u2013 the one for medical care for the aged \u2013 that that would be financed out of Social Security. That, however, is raising taxes for those who pay Social Security. He points out that he would make pay-as-you-go be the basis for our natural resources development. Where our natural resources development \u2013 which I also support, incidentally, however \u2013 whenever you uh \u2013 uh \u2013 in \u2013 in \u2013 uh \u2013 appropriates money for one of these projects, you have to pay now and appropriate the money and the eh- while they eventually do pay out, it doesn\u2019t mean that you \u2013 the government doesn\u2019t have to put out the money this year. And so I would say that in all of these proposals Senator Kennedy has made, they will result in one of two things: either he has to raise taxes or he has to unbalance the budget. If he unbalances the budget, that means you have inflation, and that will be, of course, a very cruel blow to the very people \u2013 the older people \u2013 that we\u2019ve been talking about. As far as aid for school construction is concerned, I favor that, as Senator Kennedy did, in January of this year, when he said he favored that rather than aid to s- teacher salaries. I favor that because I believe that\u2019s the best way to aid our schools without running any risk whatever of the federal government telling our teachers what to teach."}

SMITH","Speaker":"MR. NIXON","Text":"I\u2019m awfully glad you ge- got that question because as you know I got into it at the last of my other question and wasn\u2019t able to complete the argument. Uh \u2013 I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh \u2013 pay teachers\u2019 salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers\u2019 salaries \u2013 at least that\u2019s the way I read his remarks. Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers\u2019 salaries? Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then? Why do I take it now? We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers\u2019 salaries. We need higher teachers\u2019 salaries. But we also want our education to be free of federal control. When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach. I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession. There is another point that should be made. I favor higher salaries for teachers. But, as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference, the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction, which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers\u2019 salaries. I should also point out this; once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers\u2019 salaries, your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should. I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility. Teachers\u2019 salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries. This is not enough; it should be more. But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program. My objection here is not the cost in dollars. My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have."}

SMITH","Speaker":"MR. KENNEDY","Text":"When uh \u2013 the Vice President quotes me in January, sixty, I do not believe the federal government should pay directly teachers\u2019 salaries, but that was not the issue before the Senate in February. The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state. The state then could determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher salaries. On that question the Vice President and I disagreed. I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly, because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I disagreed, and his tie vote uh \u2013 defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal. I don\u2019t want the federal government paying teachers\u2019 salaries directly. But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers\u2019 salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee. And therefore I think that was a sound proposal and that is why I supported it and I regret that it did not pass. Secondly, there have been statements made that uh \u2013 the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget. That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars. That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record. My view is that you can do these programs \u2013 and they should be carefully drawn \u2013 within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead."}

SMITH","Speaker":"MR. KENNEDY","Text":"If I may take the bills, we did pass in the Senate a bill uh \u2013 to provide a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage. It failed because the House did not pass it and the House failed by eleven votes. And I might say that two-thirds of the Republicans in the House voted against a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage and a majority of the Democrats sustained it \u2013 nearly two-thirds of them voted for the dollar twenty-five. We were threatened by a veto if we passed a dollar and a quarter \u2013 it\u2019s extremely difficult with the great power that the president does to pass any bill when the president is opposed to it. All the president needs to sustain his veto of any bill is one-third plus one in either the House or the Senate. Secondly, we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate. It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives. It was killed in the Rules Committee. And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House. Four Democrats voted for it. Every Republican on the Rules Committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the House of Representatives. Thirdly, on medical care for the aged, this is the same fight that\u2019s been going on for twenty-five years in Social Security. We wanted to tie it to Social Security. We offered an amendment to do so. Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it. And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it. In my judgment, a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs. But if you send a Republican president and a Democratic majority and the threat of a veto hangs over the Congress, in my judgment you will continue what happened in the August session, which is a clash of parties and inaction."}

SMITH","Speaker":"MR. NIXON","Text":"Well obviously my views are a little different. First of all, I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s possible for a one-third of a body, such as the Republicans have in the House and the Senate to stop two-thirds, if the two-thirds are adequately led. I would say, too, that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans. It would seem to me again that it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the eight Democrats\u2019 not getting a something through that particular committee. I would say further that to blame the President in his veto power for the inability of the Senator and his colleagues to get action in this special session uh \u2013 misses the mark. When the president exercises his veto power, he has to have the people upo- behind him, not just a third of the Congress. Because let\u2019s consider it. If the majority of the members of the Congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues \u2013 the majority of those who were Democrats \u2013 why didn\u2019t they pass them and send to the President and get a veto and have an issue? The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them; it was because the people were against them. It was because they were too extreme. And I am convinced that the alternate proposals that I have, that the Republicans have in the field of health, in the field of education, in the field of welfare, because they are not extreme, because they will accomplish the end uh \u2013 without too great cost in dollars or in freedom, that they could get through the next Congress."}

SMITH","Speaker":"MR. KENNEDY","Text":"Well, now let\u2019s look at these bills that the Vice President suggests were too extreme. One was a bill for a dollar twenty-five cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s extreme at all; and yet nearly two-thirds to three-fourths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against that proposal. Secondly was the federal aid to education bill. It \u2013 it was a very uh \u2013 because of the defeat of teacher salaries, it was not a bill that uh \u2013 met in my opinion the need. The fact of the matter is it was a bill that was less than you recommended, Mr. Nixon, this morning in your proposal. It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House \u2013 not one Republican \u2013 and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it. I don\u2019t say the Democrats are united in their support of the program. But I do say a majority are. And I say a majority of the Republicans are opposed to it. The third is medical care for the aged which is tied to Social Security, which is financed out of Social Security funds. It does not put a deficit on the Treasury. The proposal advanced by you and by Mr. Javits would have cost six hundred millions of dollars \u2013 Mr. Rockefeller rejected it in New York, said he didn\u2019t agree with the financing at all, said it ought to be on Social Security. So these are three programs which are quite moderate. I think it shows the difference between the two parties. One party is ready to move in these programs. The other party gives them lip service."}

The question of Communism within the United States has been one that has worried us in the past. It is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come. We have to remember that the cold war that Mr. Khrushchev is waging and his colleagues are waging, is waged all over the world and it\u2019s waged right here in the United States. That\u2019s why we have to continue to be alert. It is also essential in being alert that we be fair; fair because by being fair we uphold the very freedoms that the Communists would destroy. We uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow. And, in this connection, I think that uh \u2013 we must look to the future having in mind the fact that we fight Communism at home not only by our laws to deal with Communists uh \u2013 the few who do become Communists and the few who do become tra- fellow travelers, but we also fight Communism at home by moving against those various injustices which exist in our society which the Communists feed upon. And in that connection I again would say that while Senator Kennedy says we are for the status quo, I do believe that he uh \u2013 would agree that I am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education, my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his. The question again is not one of goals \u2013 we\u2019re for those goals \u2013 it\u2019s one of means."}

Too often in appraising whether we are moving ahead or not we think only of what the federal government is doing. Now that isn\u2019t the test of whether America moves. The test of whether America moves is whether the federal government, plus the state government, plus the local government, plus the biggest segment of all \u2013 individual enterprise \u2013 moves. We have for example a gross national product of approximately five hundred billion dollars. Roughly a hundred billion to a hundred and a quarter billion of that is the result of government activity. Four hundred billion, approximately, is a result of what individuals do. Now, the reason the Eisenhower Administration has moved, the reason that we\u2019ve had the funds, for example, locally to build the schools, and the hospitals, and the highways, to make the progress that we have, is because this Administration has encouraged individual enterprise; and it has resulted in the greatest expansion of the private sector of the economy that has ever been witnessed in an eight-year period. And that is growth. That is the growth that we are looking for; it is the growth that this Administration has supported and that its policies have stimulated."}

I think what we have to do, however, is have the president and the leadership set before our country exactly what we must do in the next decade, if we\u2019re going to maintain our security in education, in economic growth, in development of natural resources. The Soviet Union is making great gains. It isn\u2019t enough to compare what might have been done eight years ago, or ten years ago, or fifteen years ago, or twenty years ago. I want to compare what we\u2019re doing with what our adversaries are doing, so that by the year 1970 the United States is ahead in education, in health, in building, in homes, in economic strength.

SMITH","Speaker":"MR. NIXON","Text":"Thank you, Mr. Smith. Senator Kennedy. First of all, I think it is well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the Soviet Union in this whole matter of growth. The Soviet Union has been moving faster than we have. But the reason for that is obvious. They start from a much lower base. Although they have been moving faster in growth than we have, we find, for example, today that their total gross national product is only forty-four per cent of our total gross national product. That\u2019s the same percentage that it was twenty years ago. And as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago. Is this any reason for complacency? Not at all Because these are determined men. They are fanatical men. And we have to get the very most of uh \u2013 out uh \u2013 out of our economy. I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score. Where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy. I respectfully submit that Senator Kennedy too often would rely too much on the federal government, on what it would do to solve our problems, to stimulate growth. I believe that when we examine the Democratic platform, when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight, when we compare them with the proposals that I have made, that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that I have advocated. There are many of the points that he has made that I would like to comment upon. The one in the field of health is worth mentioning. Our health program \u2013 the one that Senator Javits and other Republican Senators, as well as I supported \u2013 is one that provides for all people over sixty-five who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it. It provides a choice of having either government insurance or private insurance. But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it. His program under Social Security, would require everybody who had Social Security to take government health insurance whether he wanted it or not. And it would not cover several million people who are not covered by Social Security at all. Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his. The other point that I would make is this: this downgrading of how much things cost I think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when \u2013 during the Truman Administration when the government was spending more than it took in \u2013 we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation. We found the people who could least afford it \u2013 people on retired incomes uh \u2013 people on fixed incomes \u2013 we found them unable to meet their bills at the end of the month. It is essential that a man who\u2019s president of this country certainly stand for every program that will mean for growth. And I stand for programs that will mean growth and progress. But it is also essential that he not allow a dollar spent that could be better spent by the people themselves."}

SMITH","Speaker":"MR. KENNEDY","Text":"The point was made by Mr. Nixon that the Soviet production is only forty-four percent of ours. I must say that forty-four percent and that Soviet country is causing us a good deal of trouble tonight. I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship. I don\u2019t want to see the day when it\u2019s sixty percent of ours, and seventy and seventy-five and eighty and ninety percent of ours, with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction. Secondly, the Vice President mentioned medical care for the aged. Our program was an amendment to the Kerr bill. The Kerr bill provided assistance to all those who were not on Social Security. I think it\u2019s a very clear contrast. In 1935, when the Social Security Act was written, ninety-four out of ninety-five Republicans voted against it. Mr. Landon ran in 1936 to repeal it. In August of 1960, when we tried to get it again, but this time for medical care, we received the support of one Republican in the Senate on this occasion. Thirdly, I think the question before the American people is: as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them, the goals are the same for all Americans. The means are at question. The means are at issue. If you feel that everything that is being done now is satisfactory, that the relative power and prestige and strength of the United States is increasing in relation to that of the Communists; that we\u2019ve b- gaining more security, that we are achieving everything as a nation that we should achieve, that we are achieving a better life for our citizens and greater strength, then I agree. I think you should vote for Mr. Nixon. But if you feel that we have to move again in the sixties, that the function of the president is to set before the people the unfinished business of our society as Franklin Roosevelt did in the thirties, the agenda for our people \u2013 what we must do as a society to meet our needs in this country and protect our security and help the cause of freedom. As I said at the beginning, the question before us all, that faces all Republicans and all Democrats, is: can freedom in the next generation conquer, or are the Communists going to be successful? That\u2019s the great issue. And if we meet our responsibilities I think freedom will conquer. If we fail, if we fail to move ahead, if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country, then I think that uh \u2013 the tide could begin to run against us. And I don\u2019t want historians, ten years from now, to say, these were the years when the tide ran out for the United States. I want them to say these were the years when the tide came in; these were the years when the United States started to move again. That\u2019s the question before the American people, and only you can decide what you want, what you want this country to be, what you want to do with the future. I think we\u2019re ready to move. And it is to that great task, if we\u2019re successful, that we will address ourselves."}

NIXON","Text":"Well first of all, I don\u2019t agree with Senator Kennedy that Cuba is lost and certainly China was lost when this Administration came into power in 1953. As I look at Cuba today, I believe that we are following the right course, a course which is difficult but a course which under the circumstance is the only proper one which will see that the Cuban people get a chance to realize their aspirations of progress through freedom and that they get that with our cooperation with the other organi- of the states in the Organization of American States. Now Senator Kennedy has made some very strong criticisms of my part \u2013 or alleged part \u2013 in what has happened in Cuba. He points to the fact that I visited Cuba while Mr. Batista was in power there. I can only point out that if we are going to judge the Administrations in terms of our attitude toward dictators, we\u2019re glad to have a comparison with the previous administration. There were eleven dictators in South America and in Central America when we came in, in 1953. Today there are only three left including the one in Cuba. We think that\u2019s pretty good progress. Senator Kennedy also indicated with regard to Cuba that he thought that I had made a mistake when I was in Cuba in not calling for free elections in that country. Now I\u2019m very surprised that Senator Kennedy, who is on the Foreign Relations Committee, would have made such a statement as this kind. As a matter of fact in his book, The Strategy for Peace, he took the right position. And that position is that the United States has a treaty \u2013 a treaty with all of the Organization of American States \u2013 which prohibits us from interfering in the internal affairs of any other state and prohibits them as well. For me to have made such a statement would been in direct uh \u2013 opposition to that treaty. Now with regard to Cuba, let me make one thing clear. There isn\u2019t any question but that we will defend our rights there. There isn\u2019t any question but that we will defend Guantanamo if it\u2019s attacked. There also isn\u2019t any question but that the free people of Cuba \u2013 the people who want to be free \u2013 are going to be supported and that they will attain their freedom. No, Cuba is not lost, and I don\u2019t think this kind of defeatist talk by Senator Kennedy helps the situation one bit."}

KENNEDY","Text":"In the first place I\u2019ve never suggested that Cuba was lost except for the present. In my speech last night I indicated that I thought that Cuba one day again would be free. Where I\u2019ve been critical of the Administration\u2019s policy, and where I criticized Mr. Nixon, was because in his press conference in Havana in 1955, he praised the competence and stability of the bicta- bict- Batista dictatorship \u2013 that dictatorship had killed over twenty thousand Cubans in seven years. Secondly, I did not criticize him for not calling for free elections. What I criticized was the failure of the Administration to use its great influence to persuade the Cuban government to hold free elections, particularly in 1957 and 1958. Thirdly, Arthur Gardner, a Republican Ambassador, Earl Smith, a Republican Ambassador, in succession \u2013 both have indicated in the past six weeks that they reported to Washington that Castro was a Marxist, that Raul Castro was a Communist, and that they got no effective results. Instead our aid continued to Batista, which was ineffective; we never were on the side of freedom; we never used our influence when we could have used it most effectively \u2013 and today Cuba is lost for freedom. I hope some day it will rise; but I don\u2019t think it will rise if we continue the same policies toward Cuba that we did in recent years, and in fact towards all of Latin America \u2013 when we\u2019ve almost ignored the needs of Latin America; we\u2019ve beamed not a single Voice of America program in Spanish to all of Latin America in the last eight years, except for the three months of the Hungarian uh \u2013 revolution."}

KENNEDY","Text":"Mr. Morgan, I suggested that if the United States felt that it could save the summit conference that it would have been proper for us to have expressed regrets. In my judgment that statement has been distorted uh \u2013 by Mr. Nixon and others in their debates around the country and in their discussions. Mr. Lodge, on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d a month ago, said if there was ever a case when we did not have law an our side it was in the U-2 incident. The U-2 flights were proper from the point of view of protecting our security. But they were not in accordance with international law. And I said that I felt that rather than tell the lie which we told, rather than indicate that the flights would continue \u2013 in fact, I believe Mr. Nixon himself said on May fifteenth that the flights would continue even though Mr. Herter testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that they had been canceled as of May twelfth \u2013 that it would have been far better that if we had expressed regrets, if that would have saved the summit, and if the summit is useful \u2013 and I believe it is. The point that is always left out is the fact that we expressed regrets to Castro this winter; that we expressed regrets \u2013 the Eisenhower Administration expressed regrets \u2013 for a flight over Southern Russia in 1958. We expressed regrets for a flight over Eastern Germany under this Administration. The Soviet Union in 1955 expressed regrets to us over the Bering Sea incident. The Chinese Communists expressed regrets to us over a plane incident in 1956. That is the accepted procedure between nations; and my judgment is that we should follow the advice of Theodore Roosevelt: Be strong; maintain a strong position; but also speak softly. I believe that in those cases where international custom calls for the expression of a regret, if that would have kept the summit going, in my judgment it was a proper action. It\u2019s not appeasement. It\u2019s not soft. I believe we should be stronger than we now are. I believe we should have a stronger military force. I believe we should increase our strength all over the world. But I don\u2019t confuse words with strength; and in my judgment if the summit was useful, if it would have brought us closer to peace, that rather than the lie that we told \u2013 which has been criticized by all responsible people afterwards \u2013 it would have been far better for us to follow the common diplomatic procedure of expressing regrets and then try to move on."}

NIXON","Text":"I think Kenne- Senator Kennedy is wrong on three counts. First of all, he\u2019s wrong in thinking th- er- even suggesting that Mr. Khrushchev might have continued the conference if we had expressed regrets. He knew these flights were going on long before and that wasn\u2019t the reason that he broke up the conference. Second, he\u2019s wrong in the analogies that he makes. The United States is a strong country. Whenever we do anything that\u2019s wrong, we can express regrets. But when the president of the United States is doing something that\u2019s right, something that is for the purpose of defending the security of this country against surprise attack, he can never express regrets or apologize to anybody, including Mr. Khrushchev. Now in that connection Senator Kennedy has criticized the President on the ground not only of not expressing regrets, but because he allowed this flight to take place while the summit conference \u2013 or immediately before the summit conference occurred. This seems to me is criticism that again is wrong on his part. We all remember Pearl Harbor. We lost three thousand American lives. We cannot afford an intelligence gap. And I just want to make my position absolutely clear with regard to getting intelligence information. I don\u2019t intend to see to it that the United States is ever in a position where, while we\u2019re negotiating with the Soviet Union, that we discontinue our intelligence effort. And I don\u2019t intend ever to express regrets to Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else if I\u2019m doing something that has the support of the Congress and that is right for the purpose of protecting the security of the United States."}
{"Title":"October 7, 1960 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Second Kennedy-Nixon Presidential Debate","Date":-291427200000,"Participants":"Kennedy-Nixon","Moderators":"FRANK McGEE","Speaker":"MR. NIXON","Text":"My intentions in the field of civil rights have been spelled out in the Republican platform. I think we have to make progress first in the field of employment. And there we would give statutory authority to the Committee on Government Contracts, which is an effective way of getting real progress made in this area, since about one out of every four jobs is held by and is allotted by people who have government contracts. Certainly I think all of us agree that when anybody has a government contract, certainly the money that is spent under that contract ought to be disbursed equally without regard to the race or creed or color of the individual who is to be employed. Second, in the field of schools, we believe that there should be provisions whereby the federal government would give assistance to those districts who do want to integrate their schools. That of course was rejected as was the government contracts provision by the special session of the Congress to \u2013 in which Mr. Kennedy was quite active. And then as far as other areas are concerned, I think that we have to look to presidential leadership. And when I speak of presidential leadership, I refer for example to our attitude on the sit-in strikes. Here we have a situation which causes all of us concern \u2013 causes us concern because of the denial of the rights of people to the equality which we think belongs to everybody. I have talked to Negro mothers. I\u2019ve heard them explain \u2013 try to explain \u2013 how they tell their children how they can go into a store and buy a loaf of bread but then can\u2019t go into that store and sit at the counter and get a Coca Cola. This is wrong, and we have to do something about it. So, under the circumstances, what do we do? Well what we do is what the Attorney-General of the United States did under the direction of the President: call in the owners of chain stores and get them to take action. Now there are other places where the executive can lead, but let me just sum up by saying this: why do I talk every time I\u2019m in the South on civil rights? Not because I am preaching to the people of the South because this isn\u2019t just a Southern problem; it\u2019s a Northern problem and a Western problem; it\u2019s a problem for all of us. I do it because it\u2019s the responsibility of leadership, I do it because we have to solve this problem together. I do it right at this time particularly because when we have Khrushchev in this country \u2013 a man who has enslaved millions, a man who has slaughtered thousands \u2013 we cannot continue to have a situation where he can point the finger at the United States of America and say that we are denying rights to our citizens. And so I say both the candidates and both the vice presidential candidates, I would hope as well \u2013 including Senator Johnson \u2013 should talk on this issue at every opportunity."}

KENNEDY","Text":"Well, Mr. Nixon hasn\u2019t discussed the two basic questions: what is going to be done and what will be his policy on implementing the Supreme Court decision of 1954? Giving aid to schools technically that are trying to carry out the decision is not the great question. Secondly, what\u2019s he going to do to provide fair employment? He\u2019s been the head of the Committee on Government Contracts that\u2019s carried out two cases, both in the District of Columbia. He has not indicated his support of an attempt to provide fair employment practices around the country, so that everyone can get a job regardless of their race or color. Nor has he indicated that he will support Title Three, which would give the Attorney General additional powers to protect Constitutional rights. These are the great questions: equality of education in school. About two percent of our population of white people are \u2013 is illiterate, ten per cent of our colored population. Sixty to seventy percent of our colored children do not finish high school. These are the questions in these areas that the North and South, East and West are entitled to know. What will be the leadership of the president in these areas to provide equality of opportunity for employment? Equality of opportunity in the field of housing, which could be done on all federal supported housing by a stroke of the president\u2019s pen. What will be done to provide equality of education in all sections of the United States? Those are the questions to which the president must establish a moral tone and moral leadership. And I can assure you that if I\u2019m elected president we will do so."}

NIXON","Text":"Senator Kennedy has expressed some hopes in this field, hopes which I think all Americans would share who want some problem \u2013 some progress in this area. But let\u2019s look at the performance. When he selected his vice presidential running mate, he selected a man who had voted against most of these proposals and who opposes them at the present time. Let me s- look also at what I did. I selected a man who stands with me in this field and who will talk with me and work with me on it. Now the Senator referred to the Committee on Government Contracts. And yet that very committee of which I am chairman has been handicapped by the fact that we have not had adequate funds; we have not had adequate powers; we haven\u2019t had an adequate staff. Now in the special session of Congress and also in the session that preceded it, the Democratic Congress \u2013 in which there\u2019s a two-to-one Democratic majority \u2013 was asked by the President to give us the funds and give us the power to do a job and they did nothing at all, And in the special session in which Senator Kennedy was calling the signals, along with Senator Johnson, they turned it down and he himself voted against giving us the powers despite the fact that the bill had already been considered before, that it already had hearings on, and the Congress already knew what it had before it. All that I can say is this: what we need here are not just high hopes. What we need is action. And in the field of executive leadership, I can say that I believe it\u2019s essential that the president of the United States not only set the tone but he also must lead; he must act as he talks."}

NIXON","Text":"Mr. Morgan, no matter how well we\u2019re doing in the cold war, we\u2019re not doing as well as we should. And that will always be the case as long as the Communists are on the international scene, in the aggressive tac- uh \u2013 tendencies that they presently are following. Now as far as the present situation is concerned, I think it\u2019s time that we nail a few of these distortions about the United States that have been put out. First of all, we hear that our prestige is at an all-time low. Senator Kennedy has been hitting that point over and over again. I would suggest that after Premier Kush- Khrushchev\u2019s uh \u2013 performance in the United Nations, compared with President Eisenhower\u2019s eloquent speech, that at the present time Communist prestige in the world is at an all-time low and American prestige is at an all-time high. Now that, of course, is just one factor, but it\u2019s a significant one. When we look, for example, at the vote on the Congo. We were on one side; they were on the other side. What happened? There were seventy votes for our position and none for theirs. Look at the votes in the United Nations over the past seven and a half years. That\u2019s a test of prestige. Every time the United States has been an one side and they\u2019ve been on the other side, our position has been sustained. Now looking to what we ought to do in the future. In this cold war we have to recognize where it is being fought and then we have to develop programs to deal with it. It\u2019s being fought primarily in Asia, in Africa, and in Latin America. What do we need? What tools do we need to fight us? Well we need, for example, economic assistance; we need technical assistance; we need exchange; we need programs of diplomatic and other character which will be effective in that area. Now Senator Kennedy a moment ago referred to the fact that there was not an adequate Voice of America program for Latin America. I\u2019d like to point out that in the last six years, the Democratic Congresses, of which he\u2019d been a member, have cut twenty million dollars off of the Voice of America programs. They also have cut four billion dollars off of mutual security in these last six years. They also have cut two billion dollars off of defense. Now when they talk about our record here, it is well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well. So let me summarize by saying this: I\u2019m not satisfied with what we\u2019re doing in the cold war because I believe we have to step up our activities and launch an offensive for the minds and hearts and souls of men. It must be economic; it must be technological; above all it must be ideological. But we\u2019ve got to get help from the Congress in order to do this."}

KENNEDY","Text":"Of course Mr. Nixon is wholly inaccurate when he says that the Congress has not provided more funds in fact than the President recommended for national defense. Nineteen fifty-three we tried to put an appropriation of five billion dollars for our defenses. I was responsible for the amendment with Senator Monroney in 1954 to strengthen our ground forces. The Congress of the United States appropriated six hundred and seventy-seven million dollars mare than the President was willing to use up till a week ago. Secondly, on the question of our position in the United Nations. We all know about the vote held this week \u2013 of the five neutralists \u2013 and it was generally regarded as a defeat for the United States. Thirdly, in 1952, there were only seven votes in favor of the admission of Red China into the United Nations. Last year there were twenty-nine and tomorrow when the preliminary vote is held you will see a strengthening of that position or very closely to it. We have not maintained our position and our prestige. A Gallup Poll taken in February of this year asking the \u2013 in eight out of nine countries \u2013 they asked the people, who do they think would be ahead by 1970 militarily and scientifically, and a majority in eight of the nine countries said the Soviet Union would be by 1970. Governor Rockefeller has been far more critical in June of our position in the world than I have been. The Rockefeller Brothers report, General Ridgway, General Gavin, the Gaither Report, various reports of Congressional committees all indicate that the relative strength of the p- United States both militarily, politically, psychologically, and scientifically and industrially \u2013 the relative strength of the so- of United States compared to that of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists together \u2013 has deteriorated in the last eight years and we should know it, and the American people should be told the facts."}

KENNEDY","Text":"Yes. We have been wholly indifferent to Latin America until the last few months. The program that was put forward this summer, after we broke off the sugar quota with Cuba, really was done because we wanted to get through the O.A.S. meeting a condemnation of Russian infiltration of Cuba. And therefore we passed an authorization \u2013 not an aid bill \u2013 which was the first time, really, since the Inter-American Bank which was founded a year ago was developed, that we really have looked at the needs of Latin America; that we have associated ourselves with those people. Secondly, I believe that in the ca- that it\u2019s far better for the United States, instead of concentrating our aid, particularly in the underdeveloped world, on surplus military equipment \u2013 we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into Laos. We paid more military aid, more aid into Laos po- per \u2013 per person than in any country in the world and we ought to know now that Laos is moving from neutralism in the direction of the Communists. I believe instead of doing that, we should concentrate our aid in long-term loans which these people can pay back either in hard money or in local currency. This permits them to maintain their self-respect. It permits us to make sure that the projects which are invested in are going to produce greater wealth. And I believe that in cases of India and Africa and Latin America that this is where our emphasis should be. I would strengthen the Development Loan Fund. And Senator Fulbright, Senator Humphrey and I tried to do that. We tried to provide an appropriation of a billion and a half for five years, on a long-term loan basis, which this Administration opposed. And unless we\u2019re ready to carry out programs like that in the sixties, this battle for economic survival which these people are waging are going to be lost. And if India should lose her battle, with thirty-five per cent of the people of the underdeveloped world within her borders, then I believe that the balance of power could move against us. I think the United States can afford to do these things. I think that we could not afford not to do these things. This goes to our survival. And here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if it\u2019s developing its economy to the fullest \u2013 which we are not now \u2013 in my judgment, we\u2019ll have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas. I believe it\u2019s essential that we do it because in the next ten years the balance of power is going to begin to move in the world from one direction or another \u2013 towards us or towards the Communists \u2013 and unless we begin to identify ourselves not only with the anti-Communist fight, but also with the fight against poverty and hunger, these people are going to begin to turn to the Communists as an example. I believe we can do it. If we build our economy the way we should, we can afford to do these things and we must do it."}

But it\u2019s also tremendously important to bear in mind that when you pour in money without pouring in technical assistance at w- as well, that you have a disastrous situation. We need to step up exchange; we need to step up technical assistance so that trained people in these newly developing countries can operate the economies. We also have to have in mind something else with regard to this whole situation in the world, and that is: that as America moves forward, we not only must think in terms of fighting Communism, but we must also think primarily in terms of the interests of these countries. We must associate ourselves with their aspirations. We must let them know that the great American ideals \u2013 of independence, of the right of people to be free, and of the right to progress \u2013 that these are ideals that belong not to ourselves alone, but they belong to everybody. This we must get across to the world. And we can\u2019t do it unless we do have adequate funds for, for example, information which has been cut by the Congress, adequate funds for technical assistance. The other point that I would make with regard to economic assistance and technical assistance is that the United States must not rest its case here alone. This is primarily an ideological battle \u2013 a battle for the minds and the hearts and the souls of men. We must not meet the Communists purely in the field of gross atheistic materialism. We must stand for our ideals."}

NIXON","Text":"To combat unemployment we first must concentrate on the very areas to which you refer \u2013 the so-called depressed areas. Now in the last Congress \u2013 the special session of the Congress \u2013 there was a bill: one by the President, one by Senator Kennedy and members of his party. Now the bill that the President had submitted would have provided more aid for those areas that really need it \u2013 areas like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and the areas of West Virginia \u2013 than the ones that Senator Kennedy was supporting. On the other hand we found that the bill got into the legislative difficulties and consequently no action was taken. So point one, at the highest priority we must get a bill for depressed areas through the next Congress. I have made recommendations on that and I have discussed them previously and I will spell them out further in the campaign. Second, as we consider this problem of unemployment, we have to realize where it is. In analyzing the figures we will find that our unemployment exists among the older citizens; it exists also among those who are inadequately trained; that is, those who do not have an adequate opportunity for education. It also exists among minority groups. If we\u2019re going to combat unemployment, then, we have to do a better job in these areas. That\u2019s why I have a program for education, a program in the case of equal job opportunities, and one that would also deal with our older citizens. Now finally, with regard to the whole problem of combating recession, as you call it, we must use the full resources of the government in these respects: one, we must see to it that credit is expanded as we go into any recessionary period \u2013 and understand, I do not believe we\u2019re going into a recession. I believe this economy is sound and that we\u2019re going to move up. But second, in addition to that, if we do get into a recessionary period we should move on that part of the economy which is represented by the private sector, and I mean stimulate that part of the economy that can create jobs \u2013 the private sector of the economy. This means through tax reform and if necessary tax cuts that will stimulate more jobs. I favor that rather than massive federal spending programs which will come into effect usually long after you\u2019ve passed through the recessionary period. So we must use all of these weapons for the purpose of combating recession if it should come. But I do not expect it to come."}

KENNEDY","Text":"Well Mr. Nixon has stated the record inaccurately in regard to the depressed area bill. I\u2019m very familiar with it. It came out of the committee of which I was the chairman \u2013 the labor subcommittee \u2013 in fifty-five. I was the floor manager. We passed an area redevelopment bill far more effective than the bill the Administration suggested, on two occasions, and the President vetoed it both times. We passed a bill again this year in the cong- in the Senate and it died in the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives. Let me make it very clear that the bill that Mr. Nixon talked about did not mention Wilkes-Barre or Scranton; it did not mention West Virginia. Our bill was far more effective. The bill introduced and erd- sponsored by Senator Douglas was far more effective in trying to stimulate the economy of those areas. Secondly, he has mentioned the problem of our older citizens. I cannot still understand why this Administration and Mr. Nixon oppose putting medical care for the aged under Social Security to give them some security. Third, I believe we should step up the use of our surplus foods in these areas until we\u2019re able to get the people back to work. Five cents a day \u2013 that\u2019s what the food package averages per person. Fourthly, I believe we should not carry out a hard money, high interest rate policy which helped intensify certainly the recession of 1958, and I think helped bring the slow-down of 1960. If we move into a recession in sixty-one, then I would agree that we have to put more money into the economy, and it can be done by either one of the two methods discussed. One is by ex- the programs such as aid to education. The other would be to make a judgment on what\u2019s the most effective tax program to stimulate our economy."}

KENNEDY","Text":"Well I understood that this was the Eisenhower-Nixon Administration according to all the Republican uh \u2013 propaganda that I\u2019ve read. The question is what we\u2019re going to do in the future. I\u2019ve been critical of this Administration and I\u2019ve been critical of the President. In fact uh \u2013 Mr. Nixon uh \u2013 discussed that a week ago in a speech. I believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined. Now what is the issue is what we\u2019re going to do in the future. Now that\u2019s an issue between Mr. Nixon and myself. He feels that we\u2019re moving ahead uh \u2013 in a \u2013 we\u2019re not going into a recession in this country, economically; he feels that our power and prestige is stronger than it ever was relative to that of the Communists, that we\u2019re moving ahead. I disagree. And I believe the American people have to make the choice on November eighth between the view of whether we have to move ahead faster, whether what we\u2019re doing now is not satisfactory, whether we have to build greater strength at home and abroad and Mr. Nixon\u2019s view. That\u2019s the great issue. President Eisenhower moves from the scene on January twentieth and the next four years are the critical years. And that\u2019s the debate. That\u2019s the argument between Mr. Nixon and myself and on that issue the American people have to make their judgment and I think it\u2019s a important judgment. I think in many ways this election is more important than any since 1932, or certainly almost any in this century. Because we disagree very fundamentally on the position of the United States, and if his view prevails then I think that\u2019s going to bring an important result to this country in the sixties. If our view prevails that we have to do more, that we have to make a greater national and international effort, that we have lost prestige in Latin America \u2013 the President of Brazil \u2013 the new incumbent running for office called on Castro during his campaign because he thought it was important to get the vote of those who were supporting Castro in Latin America. In Africa, the United States has ignored Latin uh \u2013 Africa. We gave more scholarships to the Congo \u2013 this summer we offered them \u2013 than we\u2019ve given to all of Africa the year before. Less than two hundred for all the countries of Africa and they need trained leadership more than anything. We\u2019ve been uh \u2013 having a very clear decision in the last eight years. Mr. Nixon has been part of that Administration. He\u2019s had experience in it. And I believe this Administration has not met its responsibilities in the last eight years, that our power relative to that of the Communists is declining, that we\u2019re facing a very hazardous time in the sixties, and unless the United States begin to move here \u2013 unless we start to go ahead \u2013 I don\u2019t believe that we\u2019re going to meet our responsibility to our own people or to the cause of freedom. I think the choice is clear and it involves the future."}

NIXON","Text":"Well first of all, I think Senator Kennedy should make up his mind with regard to my responsibility. In our first debate he indicated that I had not had experience or at least uh \u2013 had not participated significantly in the making of the decisions. I\u2019m glad to hear tonight that he does suggest that I have had some experience. Let me make my position cl ear. I have participated in the discussions leading to the decisions in this Administration. I\u2019m proud of the record of this Administration. I don\u2019t stand on it because it isn\u2019t something to stand on but something to build on. Now looking at Senator Kennedy\u2019s credentials: he is suggesting that he will move America faster and further than I will. But what does he offer? He offers retreads of programs that failed. I submit to you that as you look at his programs, his program for example with regard to the Federal Reserve and uh \u2013 free money or loose money uh \u2013 high \u2013 low interest rates, his program in the economic field generally are the programs that were adopted and tried during the Truman Administration. And when we compare the economic progress of this country in the Truman Administration with that of the Eisenhower Administration, we find that in every index there has been a tr- great deal more performance and more progress in this Administration than in that one. I say the programs and the leadership that failed then is not the program and the leadership that America needs now. I say that the American people don\u2019t want to go back to those policies. And incidentally if Senator Kennedy disagrees, he should indicate where he believes those policies are different from those he\u2019s advocating today."}

NIXON","Text":"No, of course I haven\u2019t talked to Prime Minister Macmillan. It would not be appropriate for me to do so. The President is still going to be president for the next four months and he, of course, is the only one who could commit this country in this period. As far as a summit conference is concerned, I want to make my position absolutely clear. I would be willing as president to meet with Mr. Khrushchev or any other world leader if it would serve the cause of peace. I would not be able wou- would be willing to meet with him however, unless there were preparations for that conference which would give us some reasonable certainty \u2013 some reasonable certainty \u2013 that you were going to have some success. We must not build up the hopes of the world and then dash them as was the case in Paris. There, Mr. Khrushchev came to that conference determined to break it up. He was going to break it up because he would \u2013 knew that he wasn\u2019t going to get his way on Berlin and on the other key matters with which he was concerned at the Paris Conference. Now, if we\u2019re going to have another summit conference, there must be negotiations at the diplomatic level \u2013 the ambassadors, the Secretaries of State, and others at that level \u2013 prior to that time, which will delineate the issues and which will prepare the way for the heads of state to meet and make some progress. Otherwise, if we find the heads of state meeting and not making progress, we will find that the cause of peace will have been hurt rather than helped. So under these circumstances, I, therefore, strongly urge and I will strongly hold, if I have the opportunity to urge or to hold \u2013 this position: that any summit conference would be gone into only after the most careful preparation and only after Mr. Khrushchev \u2013 after his disgraceful conduct at Paris, after his disgraceful conduct at the United Nations \u2013 gave some assurance that he really wanted to sit down and talk and to accomplish something and not just to make propaganda."}

KENNEDY","Text":"I have no disagreement with the Vice President\u2019s position on that. It \u2013 my view is the same as his. Let me say there is only one uh \u2013 point I would add. That before we go into the summit, before we ever meet again, I think it\u2019s important that the United States build its strength; that it build its military strength as well as its own economic strength. If we negotiate from a position where the power balance or wave is moving away from us, it\u2019s extremely difficult to reach a successful decision on Berlin as well as the other questions. Now the next president of the United States in his first year is going to be confronted with a very serious question on our defense of Berlin, our commitment to Berlin. It\u2019s going to be a test of our nerve and will. It\u2019s going to be a test of our strength. And because we\u2019re going to move in sixty-one and two, partly because we have not maintained our strength with sufficient vigor in the last years, I believe that before we meet that crisis, that the next president of the United States should send a message to Congress asking for a revitalization of our military strength, because come spring or late in the winter we\u2019re going to be face to face with the most serious Berlin crisis since l949 or fifty. On the question of the summit, I agree with the position of Mr. Nixon. I would not meet Mr. Khrushchev unless there were some agreements at the secondary level \u2013 foreign ministers or ambassadors \u2013 which would indicate that the meeting would have some hope of success, or a useful exchange of ideas."}
{"Title":"October 7, 1960 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Second Kennedy-Nixon Presidential Debate","Date":-291427200000,"Participants":"Kennedy-Nixon","Moderators":"FRANK McGEE","Speaker":"MR. KENNEDY","Text":"Well I don\u2019t think that in the winter of sixty-one under present economic conditions, it uh \u2013 a \u2013 uh \u2013 tax uh \u2013 increase would be desirable. In fact, it would be deflationary; it would cause great unemployment; it would cause a real slowdown in our economy. If it ever becomes necessary, and is wise economically and essential to our security, I would have no hesitancy in suggesting a tax increase or any other policy which would defend the United States. I have talked in every speech about the fact that these are going to be very difficult times in the nineteen-sixties and that we\u2019re going to have to meet our responsibilities as citizens. I\u2019m talking about a national mood. I\u2019m talking about our willingness to bear any burdens in order to maintain our own freedom and in order to meet our freedom around the globe. We don\u2019t know what the future\u2019s going to bring. But I would not want anyone to elect me uh \u2013 president of the United States \u2013 or vote for me \u2013 under the expectation that life would be easier if I were elected. Now, many of the programs that I\u2019m talking about \u2013 economic growth, care for the aged, development of our natural resources \u2013 build the strength of the United States. That\u2019s how the United States began to prepare for its great actions in World War II and in the post-war period. If we\u2019re moving ahead, if we\u2019re providing a viable economy, if our people have sufficient resources so that they can consume what we produce; then this country\u2019s on the move, then we\u2019re stronger, then we set a better example to the world. So we have the problem of not only building our own uh \u2013 military strength and extending uh \u2013 our policies abroad, we have to do a job here at home. So I believe that the policies that I recommend came under the general heading of strengthening the United States. We\u2019re using our steel capacity fifty-five per cent today. We\u2019re not able to consume what we\u2019re able to produce at a time when the Soviet Union is making great economic gains. And all I say is, I don\u2019t know what the sixties will bring \u2013 except I think they will bring hard times in the uh \u2013 international sphere; I hope we can move ahead here at home in the United States; I\u2019m confident we can do a far better job of mobilizing our economy and resources in the United States. And I merely say that they \u2013 if they elect me president, I will do my best to carry the United States through a difficult period; but I would not want people to elect me because I promised them the easy, soft life. I think it\u2019s going to be difficult; but I\u2019m confident that this country can meet its responsibilities."}

NIXON","Text":"Well I think we should be no \u2013 under no illusions whatever about what the responsibilities of the American people will be in the sixties. Our expenditures for defense, our expenditures for mutual security, our expenditures for economic assistance and technical assistance are not going to get less. In my opinion they\u2019re going to be de- be greater. I think it may be necessary that we have more taxes. I hope not. I hope we can economize elsewhere so that we don\u2019t have to. But I would have no hesitation to ask the American people to pay the taxes even in l961 \u2013 if necessary \u2013 to maintain a sound economy and also to maintain a sound dollar. Because when you do not tax, and tax enough to pay for your outgo, you pay it many times over in higher prices and inflation; and I simply will not do that. I think I should also add that as far as Senator Kennedy\u2019s proposals are concerned, if he intends to carry out his platform \u2013 the one adopted in Los Angeles \u2013 it is just impossible for him to make good on those promises without raising taxes or without having a rise in t- prices or both. The platform suggests that it can be done through economic growth; that it can be done, in effect, with mirrors. But it isn\u2019t going to be working that way. You can\u2019t add billions of dollars to our expenditures and not pay for it. After all, it isn\u2019t paid for by my money, it isn\u2019t paid for by his, but by the people\u2019s money."}

NIXON","Text":"I did. And as I pointed out in 1952, I made it very clear that as far as the Korean War was concerned, that I felt that the decision to go into the war in Korea was right and necessary. What I criticized were the policies that made it necessary to go to Korea. Now incidentally, I should point out here that Senator Kennedy has attacked our foreign policy. He\u2019s said that it\u2019s been a policy that has led to defeat and retreat. And I\u2019d like to know where have we been defeated and where have we retreated? In the Truman Administration, six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain including the satellite countries of Eastern Europe and Communist China. In this Administration we\u2019ve stopped them at Quemoy and Matsu; we\u2019ve stopped them in Indochina; we\u2019ve stopped them in Lebanon; we\u2019ve stopped them in other parts of the world. I would also like to point out that as far as Senator Kennedy\u2019s comments are concerned, I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks we\u2019re wrong. But he has a responsibility to be accurate, and not to misstate the case. I don\u2019t think he should say that our prestige is at an all-time low. I think this is very harmful at a time Mr. Khrushchev is here \u2013 harmful because it\u2019s wrong. I don\u2019t think it was helpful when he suggested \u2013 and I\u2019m glad he\u2019s corrected this to an extent \u2013 that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night in the United States. Now this just wasn\u2019t true. Now, there are people who go to bed hungry in the United States \u2013 far less, incidentally, than used to go to bed hungry when we came into power at the end of the Truman Administration. But the thing that is right about the United States, it should be emphasized, is that less people go to bed hungry in the United States than in any major country in the world. We\u2019re the best fed; we\u2019re the best clothed, with a better distribution of this world\u2019s goods to all of our people than any people in history. Now, in pointing out the things that are wrong, I think we ought to emphasize America\u2019s strengths. It isn\u2019t necessary to \u2013 to run America down in order to build her up. Now so that we get it absolutely clear: Senator Kennedy must as a candidate \u2013 as I as a candidate in fifty-two \u2013 criticize us when we\u2019re wrong. And he\u2019s doing a very effective job of that, in his way. But on the other hand, he has a responsibility to be accurate. And I have a responsibility to correct him every time he misstates the case; and I intend to continue to do so."}

KENNEDY","Text":"Well, Mr. Nixon uh- I\u2019ll just give you the testimony of Mr. George Aiken \u2013 Senator George Aiken, the ranking minority member \u2013 Republican member \u2013 and former chairman of the Senate Agricultural Committee testifying in 1959 \u2013 said there were twenty-six million Americans who did not have the income to afford a decent diet. Mr. Benson, testifying on the food stamp plan in 1957, said there were twenty-five million Americans who could not afford a elementary low-cost diet. And he defined that as someone who uses beans in place of meat. Now I\u2019ve seen a good many hundreds of thousands of people who are uh \u2013 not adequately fed. You can\u2019t tell me that a surplus food distribution of five cents po- per person \u2013 and that n- nearly six million Americans receiving that \u2013 is adequate. You can\u2019t tell me that any one who uses beans instead of meat in the United States \u2013 and there are twenty-five million of them according to Mr. Benson \u2013 is well fed or adequately fed. I believe that we should not compare what our figures may be to India or some other country that has serious problems but to remember that we are the most prosperous country in the world and that these people are not getting adequate food. And they\u2019re not getting in many cases adequate shelter. And we ought to try to meet the problem. Secondly, Mr. Nixon has continued to state \u2013 and he stated it last week \u2013 these fantastic figures of what the Democratic budget would c- uh \u2013 platform would cost. They\u2019re wholly inaccurate. I said last week I believed in a balanced budget. Unless there was a severe recession \u2013 and after all the worst unbalanced budget in history was in 1958, twelve billion dollars \u2013 larger than in any Administration in the history of the United States. So that I believe that on this subject we can balance the budget unless we have a national emergency or unless we have a severe recession."}

KENNEDY","Text":"Well, the United States uh \u2013 has on occasion attempted uh \u2013 mostly in the middle fifties, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to pull his troops back to Formosa. I believe strongly in the defense of Formosa. These islands are a few miles \u2013 five or six miles \u2013 off the coast of Red China, within a general harbor area and more than a hundred miles from Formosa. We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it\u2019s attacked. We say we will defend it if it\u2019s part of a general attack on Formosa. But it\u2019s extremely difficult to make that judgment. Now, Mr. Herter in 1958, when he was Under Secretary of State, said they were strategically undefensible. Admirals Spruance and Callins in 1955 said that we should not attempt to defend these islands, in their conference in the Far East. General Ridgway has said the same thing. I believe that when you get into a w- if you\u2019re going to get into war for the defense of Formosa, it ought to be on a clearly defined line. One of the problems, I think, at the time of South Korea was the question of whether the United States would defend it if it were attacked. I believe that we should defend Formosa. We should come to its defense. To leave this rather in the air, that we will defend it under some conditions but not under other, I think is a mistake. Secondly, I would not suggest the withdrawal at the point of the Communist gun. It is a decision finally that the Nationalists should make and I believe that we should consult with them and attempt to work out a plan by which the line is drawn at the island of Formosa. It leaves a hundred miles between the sea. But with General Ridgway, Mr. Herter, General Collins, Admiral Spruance and many others, I think it\u2019s unwise to take the chance of being dragged into a war which may lead to a world war over two islands which are not strategically defensible, which are not, according to their testimony, essential to the defense of Formosa. I think that uh \u2013 we should protect our commitments. I believe strongly we should do so in Berlin. I believe strongly we should d- do so in Formosa and I believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security we\u2019ve guaranteed. But I do not believe that that line in case of war should be drawn on those islands but instead on the island of Formosa. And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa, it\u2019s been my judgment ever since 1954, at the time of the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Far East, that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself."}

Generals testified to that. And Secretary Acheson made a very famous speech at the Press Club, early in the year that k- Korean War started, indicating in effect that South Korea was beyond the defense zone of the United States. I suppose it was hoped when he made that speech that we wouldn\u2019t get into a war. But it didn\u2019t mean that. We had to go in when they came in. Now I think as far as Quemoy and Matsu are concerned, that the question is not these two little pieces of real estate \u2013 they are unimportant. It isn\u2019t the few people who live on them \u2013 they are not too important. It\u2019s the principle involved. These two islands are in the area of freedom. The Nationalists have these two islands. We should not uh \u2013 force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists. If we do that we start a chain reaction; because the Communists aren\u2019t after Quemoy and Matsu, they\u2019re a- they\u2019re after Formosa. In my opinion this is the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for America in Korea. I am against it. I would never tolerate it as president of the United States, and I will hope that Senator Kennedy will change his mind if he should be elected."}

Abraham Lincoln was a great president of all the people; but he was selected by his party at a key time in history because his party stood for something. The Democratic party in this century has stood for something. It has stood for progress; it has stood for concern for the people\u2019s welfare. It has stood for a strong foreign policy and a strong national defense, and as a result, produced Wilson, President Roosevelt, and President Truman. The Republican party has produced McKinley and Harding, Coolidge, Dewey, and Landon. They do stand for something. They stand for a whole different approach to the problems facing this country at home and abroad. That\u2019s the importance of party; only if it tells something about the record. And the Republicans in recent years \u2013 not only in the last twenty-five years, but in the last eight years \u2013 have opposed housing, opposed care for the aged, opposed federal aid to education, opposed minimum wage and I think that record tells something."}

As a matter of fact, the statement that Senator Kennedy made was that \u2013 to the effect that there were trigger-happy Republicans, that my stand on Quemoy and Matsu was an indication of trigger-happy Republicans. I resent that comment. I resent it because th- it\u2019s an implication that Republicans have been trigger-happy and, therefore, would lead this nation into war. I would remind Senator Kennedy of the past fifty years. I would ask him to name one Republican president who led this nation into war. There were three Democratic presidents who led us into war. I do not mean by that that one party is a war party and the other party is a peace party. But I do say that any statement to the effect that the Republican party is trigger-happy is belied by the record. We had a war when we came into power in 1953. We got rid of that; we\u2019ve kept out of other wars; and certainly that doesn\u2019t indicate that we\u2019re trigger-happy. We\u2019ve been strong, but we haven\u2019t been trigger-happy. As far as Berlin is concerned, there isn\u2019t any question about the necessity of defending Berlin; the rights of people there to be free; and there isn\u2019t any question about what the united American people \u2013 Republicans and Democrats alike \u2013 would do in the event there were an attempt by the Communists to take over Berlin."}

I will say this: in the event that such an attack occurred and in the event the attack was a prelude to an attack on Formosa \u2013 which would be the indication today because the Chinese Communists say over and over again that their objective is not the offshore islands, that they consider them only steppingstones to taking Formosa \u2013 in the event that their attack then were a prelude to an attack on Formosa, there isn\u2019t any question but that the United States would then again, as in the case of Berlin, honor our treaty obligations and stand by our ally of Formosa. But to indicate in advance how we would respond, to indicate the nature of this response would be incorrect; it would certainly be inappropriate; it would not be in the best interests of the United States. I will only say this, however, in addition: to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested \u2013 to suggest that we will surrender these islands or force our Chinese Nationalist allies to surrender them in advance \u2013 is not something that would lead to peace; it is something that would lead, in my opinion, to war. This is the history of dealing with dictators. This is something that Senator Kennedy and all Americans must know. We tried this with Hitler. It didn\u2019t work. He wanted first uh \u2013 we know, Austria, and then he went on to the Sudetenland and then Danzig, and each time it was thought this is all that he wanted. Now what do the Chinese Communists want? They don\u2019t want just Quemoy and Matsu; they don\u2019t want just Formosa; they want the world. And the question is if you surrender or indicate in advance that you\u2019re not going to defend any part of the free world, and you figure that\u2019s going to satisfy them, it doesn\u2019t satisfy them. It only whets their appetite; and then the question comes, when do you stop them? I\u2019ve often heard President Eisenhower in discussing this question, make the statement that if we once start the process of indicating that this point or that point is not the place to stop those who threaten the peace and freedom of the world, where do we stop them? And I say that those of us who stand against surrender of territory \u2013 this or any others \u2013 in the face of blackmail, in the s- face of force by the Communists are standing for the course that will lead to peace."}

KENNEDY","Text":"Yes. The whole th- the United States now has a treaty \u2013 which I voted for in the United States Senate in 1955 \u2013 to defend Formosa and the Pescadores Island. The islands which Mr. Nixon is discussing are five or four miles, respectively, off the coast of China. Now when Senator Green, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to the President, he received back on the second of October, 1958 \u2013 \u201cneither you nor any other American need feel the U.S. will be involved in military hostilities merely in the defense of Quemoy and Matsu.\u201d Now, that is the issue. I believe we must meet our commitment to uh \u2013 Formosa. I support it and the Pescadores Island. That is the present American position. The treaty does not include these two islands. Mr. Nixon suggests uh \u2013 that the United States should go to war if these two islands are attacked. I suggest that if Formosa is attacked or the Pescadores, or if there\u2019s any military action in any area which indicates an attack on Formosa and the Pescadores, then of course the United States is at war to defend its treaty. Now, I must say what Mr. Nixon wants to do is commit us \u2013 as I understand him, so that we can be clear if there\u2019s a disagreement \u2013 he wants us to be committed to the defense of these islands merely as the defense of these islands as free territory, not as part of the defense of Formosa. Admiral Yarnell, the commander of the Asiatic fleet, has said that these islands are not worth the bones of a single American. The President of the United States has indicated they are not within the treaty area. They were not within the treaty area when the treaty was passed in fifty-five. We have attempted to persuade Chiang Kai-shek as late as January of 1959 to reduce the number of troops he has on them. This is a serious issue, and I think we ought to understand completely if we disagree, and if so, where."}

Then I believe that we should move full time on our missile production, particularly on Minuteman and on Polaris. It may be a long period, but we must \u2013 we must get started immediately. Now on the question of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, I must say that I feel that another effort should be made by a new Administration in January of 1961, to renew negotiations with the Soviet Union and see whether it\u2019s possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chances of contamination of the atmosphere, and also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity. There are indications, because of new inventions, that ten, fifteen, or twenty nations will have a nuclear capacity \u2013 including Red China \u2013 by the end of the presidential office in 1964. This is extremely serious. There have been many wars in the history of mankind. And to take a chance uh \u2013 now be \u2013 and not make every effort that we could make to provide for some control over these weapons, I think would be a great mistake. One of my disagreements with the present Administration has been that I don\u2019t feel a real effort has been made an this very sensitive subject, not only of nuclear controls, but also of general disarmament. Less than a hundred people have been working throughout the entire federal government on this subject, and I believe it\u2019s been reflected in our success and failures at Geneva. Now, we may not succeed. The Soviet Union may not agree to an inspection system. We may be able to get satisfactory assurances. It may be necessary for us to begin testing again. But I hope the next Administration \u2013 and if I have anything to do with it, the next Administration will \u2013 make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels. These must be done. If we cannot succeed, then we must strengthen ourselves. But I would make the effort because I think the fate not only of our own civilization, but I think the fate of world and the future of the human race is involved in preventing a nuclear war."}

I am going to make a major speech on this whole subject next week before the next debate, and I will have an opportunity then to answer any other questions that may arise with regard to my position on it. There isn\u2019t any question but that we must move forward in every possible way to reduce the danger of war; to move toward controlled disarmament; to control tests; but also let\u2019s have in mind this: when Senator Kennedy suggests that we haven\u2019t been making an effort, he simply doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. It isn\u2019t a question of the number of people who are working in an Administration. It\u2019s a question of who they are. This has been one of the highest level operations in the whole State Department right under the President himself. We have gone certainly the extra mile and then some in making offers to the Soviet Union on control of tests, on disarmament, and in every other way. And I just want to make one thing very clear. Yes, we should make a great effort. But under no circumstances must the United States ever make an agreement based on trust. There must be an absolute guarantee. Now, just a comment on Senator Kennedy\u2019s last answer. He forgets that in this same debate on the Formosa resolution, which he said he voted for \u2013 which he did \u2013 that he voted against an amendment, or was recorded against an amendment \u2013 and on this particular \u2013 or for an amendment, I should say \u2013 which passed the Senate overwhelmingly, seventy to twelve. And that amendment put the Senate of the United States on record with a majority of the Senator\u2019s own party voting for it, as well as the majority of Republicans \u2013 put them on record \u2013 against the very position that the Senator takes now of surrendering, of indicating in advance, that the United States will not defend the offshore islands."}

NIXON","Text":"Well Mr. Drummond, first of all, referring to Secretary Dulles\u2019 press conference, I think if you read it all \u2013 and I know that you have \u2013 you will find that Secretary Dulles also indicated in that press conference that when the troops were withdrawn from Quemoy, that the implication was certainly of everything that he said, that Quemoy could better be defended. There were too many infantrymen there, not enough heavy artillery; and certainly I don\u2019t think there was any implication in Secretary Dulles\u2019 statement that Quemoy and Matsu should not be defended in the event that they were attacked, and that attack was a preliminary to an attack on Formosa. Now as far as President Eisenhower is concerned, I have often heard him discuss this question. As I uh \u2013 related a moment ago, the President has always indicated that we must not make the mistake in dealing with the dictator of indicating that we are going to make a concession at the point of a gun. Whenever you do that, inevitably the dictator is encouraged to try it again. So first it will be Quemoy and Matsu, next it may be Formosa. What do we do then? My point is this: that once you do this \u2013 follow this course of action \u2013 of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return. And that means war. We went through this tragic experience leading to World War II. We learned our lesson again in Korea, We must not learn it again. That is why I think the Senate was right, including a majority of the Democrats, a majority of the Republicans, when they rejected Senator Kennedy\u2019s position in 1955. And incidentally, Senator Johnson was among those who rejected that position \u2013 voted with the seventy against the twelve. The Senate was right because they knew the lesson of history. And may I say, too, that I would trust that Senator Kennedy would change his position on this \u2013 change it; because as long as he as a major presidential candidate continues to suggest that we are going to turn over these islands, he is only encouraging the aggressors \u2013 the Chinese Communist and the Soviet aggressors \u2013 to press the United States, to press us to the point where war would be inevitable. The road to war is always paved with good intentions. And in this instance the good intentions, of course, are a desire for peace. But certainly we\u2019re not going to have peace by giving in and indicating in advance that we are not going to defend what has become a symbol of freedom."}

KENNEDY","Text":"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for Mr. Nixon to state the record in distortion of the facts with more precision than he just did. In 1955, Mr. Dulles at a press conference said: \u201cThe treaty that we have with the Republic of China excludes Quemoy and Matsu from the treaty area.\u201d That was done with much thought and deliberation. Therefore that treaty does not commit the United States to defend anything except Formosa and the Pescadores, and to deal with acts against that treaty area. I completely sustained the treaty. I voted for it. I would take any action necessary to defend the treaty, Formosa, and the Pescadores Island. What we\u2019re now talking about is the Vice President\u2019s determination to guarantee Quemoy and Matsu, which are four and five miles off the coast of Red China, which are not within the treaty area. I do not suggest that Chiang Kai-shek \u2013 and this Administration has been attempting since 1955 to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to lessen his troop commitments. Uh \u2013 He sent a mission \u2013 the President \u2013 in 1955 of Mr. uh \u2013 Robertson and Admiral Radford. General Twining said they were still doing it in 1959. General Ridgway said \u2013 who was Chief of Staff: \u201cTo go to war for Quemoy and Matsu to me would seem an unwarranted and tragic course to take. To me that concept is completely repugnant.\u201d So I stand with them. I stand with the Secretary of State, Mr. Herter, who said these islands were indefensible. I believe that we should meet our commitments, and if the Chinese Communists attack the Pescadores and Formosa, they know that it will mean a war. I would not ho- hand over these islands under any point of gun. But I merely say that the treaty is quite precise and I sustain the treaty. Mr. Nixon would add a guarantee to islands five miles off the coast of the re- Republic of China when he\u2019s never really protested the Communists seizing Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States."}

I just do want to say one thing, however. We all have tempers; I have one; I\u2019m sure Senator Kennedy has one. But when a man\u2019s president of the United States, or a former president, he has an obligation not to lose his temper in public. One thing I\u2019ve noted as I\u2019ve traveled around the country are the tremendous number of children who come out to see the presidential candidates. I see mothers holding their babies up, so that they can see a man who might be president of the United States. I know Senator Kennedy sees them, too. It makes you realize that whoever is president is going to be a man that all the children of America will either look up to, or will look down to. And I can only say that I\u2019m very proud that President Eisenhower restored dignity and decency and, frankly, good language to the conduct of the presidency of the United States. And I only hope that, should I win this election, that I could approach President Eisenhower in maintaining the dignity of the office; in seeing to it that whenever any mother or father talks to his child, he can look at the man in the White House and, whatever he may think of his policies, he will say: \u201cWell, there is a man who maintains the kind of standards personally that I would want my child to follow.\u201d"}

NIXON","Text":"Well, Mr. Cater, of course it\u2019s a criticism that uh \u2013 is being made. Uh \u2013 I obviously don\u2019t think it\u2019s valid. I have supported the Administration\u2019s position and I think that that position has been correct; I think my position has been correct. As far as Indochina was concerned, I stated over and over again that it was essential during that period that the United States make it clear that we would not tolerate Indochina falling under Communist domination. Now, as a result of our taking the strong stand that we did, the civil war there was ended; and today, at least in the south of Indochina, the Communists have moved out and we do have a strong, free bastion there. Now, looking to the U-2 flights, I would like to point out that I have been supporting the President\u2019s position throughout. I think the President was correct in ordering these flights. I think the President was correct, certainly, in his decision to continue the flights while the conference was going on. I noted, for example, in reading a \u2013 uh \u2013 a \u2013 a particular discussion that Senator Kennedy had with Dave Garroway shortly after the uh \u2013 his statement about regrets, that uh \u2013 he made the statement that he felt that these particular flights uh \u2013 were ones that shouldn\u2019t have occurred right at that time, and the indication was how would Mr. Khrushchev had felt if we had uh \u2013 had a flight over the uni- how would we have felt if Mr. Khrushchev ha \u2013 uh \u2013 had a flight over the United States while uh \u2013 he was visiting here. And the answer, of course, is that Communist espionage goes on all the time. The answer is that the United States can\u2019t afford to have a es- an es \u2013 a espionage lack or should we s- uh \u2013 lag \u2013 or should I say uh \u2013 an intelligence lag \u2013 any more than we can afford to have a missile lag. Now, referring to your question with regard to Quemoy and Matsu. What I object to here is the constant reference to surrendering these islands. Senator Kennedy quotes the record, which he read from a moment ago, but what he forgets to point out is that the key vote \u2013 a uh \u2013 vote which I\u2019ve referred to several times \u2013 where he was in the minority was one which rejected his position. Now, why did they reject it? For the very reason that those Senators knew, as the President of the United States knew, that you should not indicate to the Communists in advance that you\u2019re going to surrender an area that\u2019s free. Why? Because they know as Senator Kennedy will have to know that if you do that you encourage them to more aggression."}

Number two, on the question of the U-2 flights. I thought the. U-2 flight in May just before the conference was a mistake in timing because of the hazards involved, if the summit conference had any hope for success. I never criticized the U-2 flights in general, however. I never suggested espionage should stop. It still goes on, I would assume, on both sides. Number three, the Vice President \u2013 on May fifteenth after the U-2 flight \u2013 indicated that the flights were going on, even though the Administration and the President had canceled the flights on May twelfth. Number three, the pre \u2013 Vice President suggests that we should keep the Communists in doubt about whether we would fight on Quemoy and Matsu. That\u2019s not the position he\u2019s taking. He\u2019s indicating that we should fight for these islands come what may because they are, in his words, in the area of freedom. He didn\u2019t take that position on Tibet. He didn\u2019t take that position on Budapest. He doesn\u2019t take that position that I\u2019ve seen so far in Laos. Guinea and Ghana have both moved within the Soviet sphere of influence in foreign policy; so has Cuba. I merely say that the United States should meet its commitments to Que- to uh \u2013 Formosa and the Pescadores. But as Admiral Yarnell has said, and he\u2019s been supported by most military authority, these islands that we\u2019re now talking about are not worth the bones of a single American soldier; and I know how difficult it is to sustain troops close to the shore under artillery bombardment.

And that means, of course, the best man that this nation can produce. And that means that we can\u2019t have any test of religion. We can\u2019t have any test of race. It must be a test of a man. Also as far as religion is concerned. I have seen Communism abroad. I see what it does. Communism is the enemy of all religions; and we who do believe in God must join together. We must not be divided on this issue. The worst thing that I can think can happen in this campaign would be for it to be decided on religious issues.

Uh \u2013 Also, so that we can get the uh \u2013 opportunity for the questioners to question me, it will be before the next television debate. Uh \u2013 I will say simply, in advance of it, that I believe that in this area, the laws which should be passed uh \u2013 as far as the big national emergency strikes are concerned, are ones that will give the president more weapons with which to deal with those strikes. Now, I have a basic disagreement with Senator Kennedy, though, on this point. He has taken the position, when he first indicated in October of last year, that he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons the president might have to stop a national emergency strike. I understand in his last speech before the Steelworkers Union, that he changed that position and indicated that he felt that government seizure might be the best way to stop a strike which could not be settled by collective bargaining. I do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure. I think the moment that you give to the union, on the one side, and to management, on the other side, the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled, that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government, and that will be a \u2013 be in the end, in my opinion, wage control; it would mean price control \u2013 all the things that we do not want. I do believe, however, that we can give to the president of the United States powers, in addition to what he presently has in the fact finding area, which would enable him to be more effective than we have been in handling these strikes. One last point I should make. The record in handling them has been very good during this Administration. We have had less man-hours lost by strikes in these last seven years than we had in the previous seven years, by a great deal. And I only want to say that however good the record is, it\u2019s got to be better. Because in this critical year \u2013 period of the sixties we\u2019ve got to move forward, all Americans must move forward together, and we have to get the greatest cooperation possible between labor and management. We cannot afford stoppages of massive effect on the economy when we\u2019re in the terrible competition we\u2019re in with the Soviets."}

I never suggested that compulsory arbitration was the solution for national emergency disputes. I\u2019m opposed to that, was opposed to it in October, 1958. I have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act. I don\u2019t know what other weapons the Vice President is talking about. I\u2019m talking about giving him four or five tools \u2013 not only the fact-finding committee that he now has under the injunction provision, not only the injunction, but also the power of the fact-finding commission to make recommendations \u2013 recommendations which would not be binding, but nevertheless would have great force of public opinion behind them. One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure. There might be others. By the president having five powers \u2013 four or five powers \u2013 and he only has very limited powers today, neither the company nor the union would be sure which power would be used; and therefore, there would be a greater incentive on both sides to reach an agreement themselves without taking it to the government. The difficulty now is the president\u2019s course is quite limited. He can set up a fact-finding committee. The fact-finding committee\u2019s powers are limited. He can provide an injunction if there\u2019s a national emergency for eighty days, then the strike can go on; and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the Congress. This is a difficult and sensitive matter. But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do. He could leave the parties in doubt as to which one he would use; and therefore there would be incentive, instead of as now \u2013 the steel companies were ready to take the strike because they felt the injunction of eighty days would break the union, which didn\u2019t happen."}

KENNEDY","Text":"Yes, I have stated in both uh \u2013 debates and state again that I believe in a balanced budget and have supported that concept during my fourteen years in the Congress. The only two times when an unbalanced budget is warranted would be during a serious recession \u2013 and we had that in fifty-eight in an unbalanced budget of twelve billion dollars \u2013 or a national emergency where there should be large expenditures for national defense, which we had in World War II and uh \u2013 during part of the Korean War. On the question of the cost of our budget, I have stated that it\u2019s my best judgment that our agricultural program will cost a billion and a half, possibly two billion dollars less than the present agricultural program. My judgment is that the program the Vice President put forward, which is an extension of Mr. Benson\u2019s program, will cost a billion dollars more than the present program, which costs about six billion dollars a year, the most expensive in history. We\u2019ve spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before that. Secondly, I believe that the high interest-rate policy that this Administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt \u2013 merely funding the debt \u2013 which is a burden an the taxpayers. I would hope, under a different monetary policy, that it would be possible to reduce that interest-rate burden, at least a billion dollars. Third, I think it\u2019s possible to gain a seven hundred million to a billion dollars through tax changes which I believe would close up loof- loopholes on dividend withholding, on expense accounts. Fourthly, I have suggested that the medical care for the aged \u2013 and the bill which the Congress now has passed and the President signed if fully implemented would cost a billion dollars on the Treasury \u2013 out of Treasury funds and a billion dollars by the states \u2013 the proposal that I have put forward and which many of the members of my party support is for medical care financed under Social Security; which would be financed under the Social Security taxes; which is less than three cents a day per person for medical care, doctors\u2019 bills, nurses, hospitals, when they retire. It is actuarially sound. So in my judgment we would spend more money in this Administration on aid to education, we\u2019d spend more money on housing, we\u2019d spend more money and I hope more wisely on defense than this Administration has. But I believe that the next Administration should work for a balanced budget, and that would be my intention. Mr. Nixon misstates my figures constantly, which uh \u2013 is of course his right, but the fact of the matter is: here is where I stand and I just want to have it on the public record."}

NIXON","Text":"Senator Kennedy has indicated on several occasions in this program tonight that I have been misstating his record and his figures. I will issue a white paper after this broadcast, quoting exactly what he said on compulsory arbitration, for example, and the record will show that I have been correct. Now as far as his figures are concerned here tonight, he again is engaging in this, what I would call, mirror game of \u201chere-it-is-and-here-it-isn\u2019t.\u201d Uh \u2013 On the one hand, for example, he suggests that as far as his medical care program is concerned that that really isn\u2019t a problem because it\u2019s from Social Security. But Social Security is a tax. The people pay it. It comes right out of your paycheck. This doesn\u2019t mean that the people aren\u2019t going to be paying the bill. He also indicates as far as his agricultural program is concerned that he feels it will cost less than ours. Well, all that I can suggest is that all the experts who have studied the program indicate that it is the most fantastic program, the worst program, insofar as its effect on the farmers, that the \u2013 America has ever had foisted upon it in an election year or any other time. And I would also point out that Senator Kennedy left out a part of the cost of that program \u2013 a twenty-five percent rise in food prices that the people would have to pay. Now are we going to have that when it isn\u2019t going to help the farmers? I don\u2019t think we should have that kind of a program. Then he goes on to say that he\u2019s going to change the interest-rate situation and we\u2019re going to get some more money that way. Well, what he is saying there in effect, we\u2019re going to have inflation. We\u2019re going to go right back to what we had under Mr. Truman when he had political control of the Federal Reserve Board. I don\u2019t believe we ought to pay our bills through inflation, through a phony interest rate."}

NIXON","Text":"Mr. Drummond, I am never satisfied with the economic growth of this country. I\u2019m not satisfied with it even if there were no Communism in the world, but particularly when we\u2019re in the kind of a race we\u2019re in, we have got to see that America grows just as fast as we can, provided we grow soundly. Because even though we have maintained, as I pointed out in our first debate, the absolute gap over the Soviet Union; even though the growth in this Administration has been twice as much as it was in the Truman Administration; that isn\u2019t good enough. Because America must be able to grow enough not only to take care of our needs at home for better education and housing and health \u2013 all these things we want. We\u2019ve got to grow enough to maintain the forces that we have abroad and to wage the non-military battle for the war \u2013 uh \u2013 for the world in Asia, in Africa and Latin America. It\u2019s going to cost more money, and growth will help us to win that battle. Now, what do we do about it? And here I believe basically that what we have to do is to stimulate that sector of America, the private enterprise sector of the economy, in which there is the greatest possibility for expansion. So that is why I advocate a program of tax reform which will stimulate more investment in our economy. In addition to that, we have to move on other areas that are holding back growth. I refer, for example, to distressed areas. We have to move into those areas with programs so that we make adequate use of the resources of those areas. We also have to see that all of the people of the United States \u2013 the tremendous talents that our people have \u2013 are used adequately. That\u2019s why in this whole area of civil rights, the equality of opportunity for employment and education is not just for the benefit of the minority groups, it\u2019s for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need. And in addition to that, we need programs, particularly in higher education, which will stimulate scientific breakthroughs which will bring more growth. Now what all this, of course, adds up to is this: America has not been standing still. Let\u2019s get that straight. Anybody who says America\u2019s been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn\u2019t been traveling around America. He\u2019s been traveling in some other country. We have been moving. We have been moving much faster than we did in the Truman years. But we can and must move faster, and that\u2019s why I stand so strongly for programs that will move America forward in the sixties, move her forward so that we can stay ahead of the Soviet Union and win the battle for freedom and peace."}

KENNEDY","Text":"Well first may I correct a statement which was made before, that under my agricultural program food prices would go up twenty-five percent. That\u2019s untrue. The fa- the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twenty-five-cent loaf of bread. Even if you put his income up ten percent, that would be two and three-quarters percent three pers- or three cents out of that twenty-five cents. The t- man who grows tomatoes \u2013 it costs less for those tomatoes than it does for the label on the can. And I believe when the average hour for many farmers\u2019 wage is about fifty cents an hour, he should do better. But anybody who suggests that that program would c- come to any figure indicated by the Vice President is in error. The Vice President suggested a number of things. He suggested that we aid distressed areas. The Administration has vetoed that bill passed by the Congress twice. He suggested we pass an aid to education bill. But the Administration and the Republican majority in the Congress has opposed any realistic aid to education. And the Vice President cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers\u2019 salaries in the Senate, which prevented that being added. This Administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth \u2013 which means jobs \u2013 of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959. And when we have to find twenty-five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years, we\u2019re going to have to grow more. Governor Rockefeller says five per cent. The Democratic platform and others say five per cent. Many say four and a half per cent. The last eight years the average growth has been about two and a half per cent. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t have full employment today."}

KENNEDY","Text":"Uh \u2013 Mr. McGee, there are about a hundred and four commodities that have some kind of depletion allowance \u2013 different kind of minerals, including oil. I believe all of those should be gone over in detail to make sure that no one is getting a tax break; to make sure that no one is getting away from paying the taxes he ought to pay. That includes oil; it includes all kinds of minerals; it includes everything within the range of taxation. We want to be sure it\u2019s fair and equitable. It includes oil abroad. Perhaps that oil abroad should be treated differently than the oil here at home. Now the oil industry recently has had hard times. Particularly some of the smaller producers. They\u2019re moving about eight or nine days in Texas. But I can assure you that if I\u2019m elected president, the whole spectrum of taxes will be gone through carefully. And if there is any inequities in oil or any other commodity, then I would vote to close that loophole, I have voted in the past to reduce the depletion allowance for the largest producers; for those from five million dollars down, to maintain it at twenty-seven and a half per cent. I believe we should study this and other allowances; tax expense, dividend expenses and all the rest, and make a determination of how we can stimulate growth; how we can provide the revenues needed to move our country forward."}

NIXON","Text":"Senator Kennedy\u2019s position and mine completely different on this. I favor the present depletion allowance. I favor it not because I want to make a lot of oil men rich, but because I want to make America rich. Why do we have a depletion allowance? Because this is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to go out and explore for oil, to develop it. If we didn\u2019t have a depletion allowance of certainly, I believe, the present amount, we would have our oil exploration cut substantially in this country. Now, as far as my position then is concerned, it is exactly opposite to the Senator\u2019s. And it\u2019s because of my belief that if America is going to have the growth that he talks about and that I talk about and that we want, the thing to do is not to discourage individual enterprise, not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and minerals, but to encourage them. And so he would be doing exactly the wrong thing. One other thing. He suggests that there are a number of other items in this whole depletion field that could be taken into account. He also said a moment ago that we would get more money to finance his programs by revising the tax laws, including depletion. I should point out that as far as depletion allowances are concerned, the oil depletion allowance is one that provides eighty percent of all of those involved in depletion, so you\u2019re not going to get much from revenue insofar as depletion allowances are concerned, unless you move in the area that he indicated. But I oppose it. I oppose it for the reasons that I mentioned. I oppose it because I want us to have more oil exploration and not less."}
{"Title":"October 13, 1960 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Kennedy-Nixon Presidential Debate","Date":-290908800000,"Participants":"Kennedy-Nixon","Moderators":"BILL SHADEL","Speaker":"MR. NIXON","Text":"Well, Mr. Von Fremd, the first thing we have to do is to continue to keep confidence abroad in the American dollar. That means that we must continue to have a balanced budget here at home in every possible circumstance that we can; because the moment that we have loss of confidence in our own fiscal policies at home, it results in gold flowing out. Secondly, we have to increase our exports, as compared with our imports. And here we have a very strong program going forward in the Department of Commerce. This one must be stepped up. Beyond that, as far as the gold supply is concerned, and as far as the movement of gold is concerned, uh \u2013 we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom. Now America has been carrying a tremendous load in this respect. I think we have been right in carrying it. I have favored our programs abroad for economic assistance and for military assistance. But now we find that the countries of Europe for example, that we have aided, and Japan, that we\u2019ve aided in the Far East; these countries \u2013 some our former enemies, have now recovered completely. They have got to bear a greater share of this load of economic assistance abroad. That\u2019s why I am advocating, and will develop during the course of the next Administration \u2013 if, of course, I get the opportunity \u2013 a program in which we enlist more aid from these other countries on a concerted basis in the programs of economic development for Africa, Asia and Latin America. The United States cannot continue to carry the major share of this burden by itself. We can a big share of it, but we\u2019ve got to have more help from our friends abroad; and these three factors, I think, will be very helpful in reversing the gold flow which you spoke about."}

KENNEDY","Text":"Just to uh \u2013 correct the record, Mr. Nixon said on depletion that his record was the opposite of mine. What I said was that this matter should be thoroughly gone into to make sure that there aren\u2019t loopholes. If his record is the opposite of that, that means that he doesn\u2019t want to go into it. Now on the question of gold. The difficulty, of course, is that we do have heavy obligations abroad, that we therefore have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of our dollars overseas to pay our troops, maintain our bases, and sustain other economies. In other words, if we\u2019re going to continue to maintain our position in the sixties, we have to maintain a sound monetary and fiscal policy. We have to have control over inflation, and we also have to have a favorable balance of trade. We have to be able to compete in the world market. We have to be able to sell abroad more than we consume uh \u2013 from abroad if we\u2019re going to be able to meet our obligations. In addition, many of the countries around the world still keep restrictions against our goads, going all the way back to the days when there was a dollar shortage. Now there isn\u2019t a dollar shortage, and yet many of these countries continue to move against our goods. I believe that we must be able to compete in the market \u2013 steel and in all the basic commodities abroad \u2013 we must be able to compete against them because we always did because of our technological lead. We have to be sure to maintain that. We have to persuade these other countries not to restrict our goods coming in, not to act as if there was a dollar gap; and third, we have to persuade them to assume some of the responsibilities that up till now we\u2019ve maintained, to assist underdeveloped countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia make an economic breakthrough on their own."}

KENNEDY","Text":"Well, I think there are many uh \u2013 tests, Mr. Drummond, of prestige. And the significance of prestige, really, is because we\u2019re so identified with the cause of freedom. Therefore, if we are on the mount, if we are rising, if our influence is spreading, if our prestige is spreading, then those uh \u2013 who stand now on the razor edge of decision between us or between the Communist system, wondering whether they should use the system of freedom to develop their countries or the system of Communism, they\u2019ll be persuaded to follow our example. There have been several indications that our prestige is not as high as it once was. Mr. George Allen, the head of our information service, said that a result of our being second in space, in the sputnik in 1957, and I quote him, I believe I paraphrase him accurately. He said that many of these countries equate space developments with scientific productivity and scientific advancement. And therefore, he said, many of these countries now feel that the Soviet Union, which was once so backward, is now on a par with the United States. Secondly, the economic growth of the Soviet Union is greater than ours. Mr. Dulles has suggested it\u2019s from two to three times as great as ours. This has a great effect on the s- underdeveloped world, which faces problems of low income and high population density and inadequate resources. Three, a Gallup Poll taken in February asked people in ten countries which country they thought would be first in 1970, both scientifically and militarily. And a majority in every country except Greece, felt that it would be the Soviet Union by l970. Four, in the votes at the U.N., particularly the vote dealing with Red China last Saturday, we received the support on the position that we had taken of only two African countries \u2013 one, Liberia, which had been tied to us for more than a century, and the other, Union of South Africa, which is not a popular country in Africa. Every other ca- African country either abstained or voted against us. A \u2013 More countries voted against us in Asia on this issue than voted with us. On the neutralists\u2019 resolution, which we were so much opposed to, the same thing happened. The candidate who was a candidate for the president of Brazil, took a trip to Cuba to call on Mr. Castro during the election in order to get the benefit of the Castro supporters uh \u2013 within Brazil. There are many indications. Guinea and Ghana, two independent countries within the last three years \u2013 Guinea in fifty-seven, Ghana within the last eighteen months \u2013 both now are supporting the Soviet foreign policy at the U.N. Mr. Herter said so himself. Laos is moving in that direction. So I would say our prestige is not so high. No longer do we give the image of being on the rise. No longer do we give an image of vitality."}

NIXON","Text":"Well, I would say first of all that Senator\u2019s \u2013 Kennedy\u2019s statement that he\u2019s just made is not going to help our Gallup Polls abroad and it isn\u2019t going to help our prestige either. Let\u2019s look at the other side of the coin. Let\u2019s look at the vote on the Congo, the vote was seventy to nothing against the Soviet Union. Let\u2019s look at the situation with regard to economic growth as it really is. We find that the Soviet Union is a very primitive economy. Its growth rate is not what counts; it\u2019s whether it is catching up with us and it is not catching up with us. We\u2019re well ahead and we can stay ahead, provided we have confidence in America and don\u2019t run her down in order to build her up. We could look also at other items which Senator Kennedy has named, but I will only conclude by saying this: in this whole matter of prestige, in the final analysis, its whether you stand for what\u2019s right. And getting back to this matter that we discussed at the outset, the matter of Quemoy and Matsu. I can think of nothing that will be a greater blow to the prestige of the United States among the free nations in Asia than for us to take Senator Kennedy\u2019s advan- advice to go \u2013 go against what a majority of the members of the Senate, both Democrat and Republican, did \u2013 said in 1955, and to say in advance we will surrender an area to the Communists. In other words, if the United States is going to maintain its strength and its prestige, we must not only be strong militarily and economically, we must be firm diplomatically. Thi- Certainly we have been speaking, I know, of whether we should have retreat or defeat. Let\u2019s remember the way to win is not to retreat and not to surrender."}
{"Title":"October 21, 1960 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Fourth Kennedy-Nixon Presidential Debate","Date":-290217600000,"Participants":"Kennedy-Nixon","Moderators":"QUINCY HOWE","Speaker":"MR. NIXON","Text":"Mr. Howe, Senator Kennedy, my fellow Americans. Since this campaign began I have had a very rare privilege. I have traveled to forty-eight of the fifty states and in my travels I have learned what the people of the United States are thinking about. There is one issue that stands out above all the rest, one in which every American is concerned, regardless of what group he may be a member and regardless of where he may live. And that issue, very simply stated, is this: how can we keep the peace \u2013 keep it without surrender? How can we extend freedom \u2013 extend it without war? Now in determining how we deal with this issue, we must find the answer to a very important but simple question: who threatens the peace? Who threatens freedom in the world? There is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom \u2013 that that is presented by the international Communist movement. And therefore if we are to have peace, we must know how to deal with the Communists and their leaders. I know Mr. Khrushchev. I also have had the opportunity of knowing and meeting other Communist leaders in the world. I believe there are certain principles we must find in dealing with him and his colleagues \u2013 principles, if followed, that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom. First, we have to learn from the past, because we cannot afford to make the mistakes of the past. In the seven years before this Administration came into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain. And at the end of that seven years we were engaged in a war in Korea which cost of thirty thousand American lives. In the past seven years, in President Eisenhower\u2019s Administration, this situation has been reversed. We ended the Korean War; by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars; and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table. Now why were we successful, as our predecessors were not successful? I think there\u2019re several reasons. In the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the Communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world. One of the major errors they made was the one that led to the Korean War. In ruling out the defense of Korea, they invited aggression in that area. They thought they were going to have peace \u2013 it brought war. We learned from their mistakes. And so, in our seven years, we find that we have been firm in our diplomacy; we have never made concessions without getting concessions in return. We have always been willing to go the extra mile to negotiate for disarmament or in any other area. But we have never been willing to do anything that, in effect, surrendered freedom any place in the world. That is why President Eisenhower was correct in not apologizing or expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev at the Paris Conference, as Senator Kennedy suggested he could have done. That is why Senator wh- President Eisenhower was also correct in his policy in the Formosa Straits, where he declined, and refused to follow the recommendations \u2013 recommendations which Senator Kennedy voted for in 1955; again made in 1959; again repeated in his debates that you have heard \u2013 recommendations with regard to \u2013 again \u2013 slicing off a piece of free territory, and abandoning it, if \u2013 in effect, to the Communists. Why did the President feel this was wrong and why was the President right and his critics wrong? Because again this showed a lack of understanding of dictators, a lack of understanding particularly of Communists, because every time you make such a concession it does not lead to peace; it only encourages them to blackmail you. It encourages them to begin a war. And so I say that the record shows that we know how to keep the peace, to keep it without surrender. Let us move now to the future. It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical\u2026 leaders that the world has ever seen. That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area. First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have \u2013 if the should launch a surprise attack \u2013 we will be able to destroy their war-making capability. They must know, in other words, that it is national suicide if they begin anything. We need this kind of strength because we\u2019re the guardians of the peace. In addition to military strength, we need to see that the economy of this country continues to grow. It has grown in the past seven years. It can and will grow even more in the next four. And the reason that it must grow even more is because we have things to do at home and also because we\u2019re in a race for survival \u2013 a race in which it isn\u2019t enough to be ahead; it isn\u2019t enough simply to be complacent. We have to move ahead in order to stay ahead. And that is why, in this field, I have made recommendations which I am confident will move the American economy ahead \u2013 move it firmly and soundly so that there will never be a time when the Soviet Union will be able to challenge our superiority in this field. And so we need military strength, we need economic strength, we also need the right diplomatic policies. What are they? Again we turn to the past. Firmness but no belligerence, and by no belligerence I mean that we do not answer insult by insult. When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues. And that example that President Eisenhower has set we will continue to follow. But all this by itself is not enough. It is not enough for us simply to be the strongest nation militarily, the strongest economically, and also to have firm diplomacy. We must have a great goal. And that is: not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world, to extend it to all the world because that is America\u2019s destiny. To extend it to all the world because the Communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend Communism. And you cannot fight a victory for Communism or a strategy of victory for Communism with the strategy, simply of holding the line. And so I say that we believe that our policies of military strength, of economic strength, of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep it without surrender. We also believe that in the great field of ideals that we can lead America to the victory for freedom \u2013 victory in the newly developing countries, victory also in the captive countries \u2013 provided we have faith in ourselves and faith in our principles."}

KENNEDY","Text":"Mr. Howe, Mr. Vice President. First uh \u2013 let me again try to correct the record on the matter of Quemoy and Matsu. I voted for the Formosa resolution in 1955. I have sustained it since then. I\u2019ve said that I agree with the Administration policy. Mr. Nixon earlier indicated that he would defend Quemoy and Matsu even if the attack on these islands, two miles off the coast of China, were not part of a general attack an Formosa and the Pescadores. I indicated that I would defend those islands if the attack were directed against Pescadores and Formosa, which is part of the Eisenhower policy. I\u2019ve supported that policy. In the last week, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have re-read the testimony of General Twining representing the Administration in 1959, and the Assistant Secretary of State before the Foreign Relations Committee in 1958, and I have accurately described the Administration policy, and I support it wholeheartedly. So that really isn\u2019t an issue in this campaign. It isn\u2019t an issue with Mr. Nixon, who now says that he also supports the Eisenhower policy. Nor is the question that all Americans want peace and security an issue in this campaign. The question is: are we moving in the direction of peace and security? Is our relative strength growing? Is, as Mr. Nixon says, our prestige at an all-time high, as he said a week ago, and that of the Communists at an all-time low? I don\u2019t believe it is. I don\u2019t believe that our relative strength is increasing. And I say that not as the Democratic standard-bearer, but as a citizen of the United States who is concerned about the United States. I look at Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States. In 1957 I was in Havana. I talked to the American Ambassador there. He said that he was the second most powerful man in Cuba. And yet even though Ambassador Smith and Ambassador Gardner, both Republican Ambassadors, both warned of Castro, the Marxist influences around Castro, the Communist influences around Castro, both of them have testified in the last six weeks, that in spite of their warnings to the American government, nothing was done. Our d- security depends upon Latin America. Can any American looking at the situation in Latin America feel contented with what\u2019s happening today, when a candidate for the presidency of Brazil feels it necessary to call \u2013 not on Washington during the campaign \u2013 but on Castro in Havana, in order to pick up the support of the Castro supporters in Brazil? At the American Conference \u2013 Inter-American Conference this summer, when we wanted them to join together in the denunciation of Castro and the Cuban Communists, we couldn\u2019t even get the Inter-American group to join together in denouncing Castro. It was rather a vague statement that they finally made. Do you know today that the Com- the Russians broadcast ten times as many programs in Spanish to Latin America as we do? Do you know we don\u2019t have a single program sponsored by our government to Cuba \u2013 to tell them our story, to tell them that we are their friends, that we want them to be free again? Africa is now the emerging area of the world. It contains twenty-five percent of all the members of the General Assembly. We didn\u2019t even have a Bureau of African Affairs until 1957. In the Africa south of the Sahara, which is the major new section, we have less students from all of Africa in that area studying under government auspices today than from the country of Thailand. If there\u2019s one thing Africa needs it\u2019s technical assistance. And yet last year we gave them less than five percent of all the technical assistance funds that we distributed around the world. We relied in the Middle East on the Baghdad Pact, and yet when the Iraqi Government was changed, the Baghdad Pact broke down. We relied on the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Middle East, which passed the Senate. There isn\u2019t one country in the Middle East that now endorses the Eisenhower Doctrine. We look to Europe uh \u2013 to Asia because the struggle is in the underdeveloped world. Which system, Communism or freedom, will triumph in the next five or ten years? That\u2019s what should concern us, not the history of ten, or fifteen, or twenty years ago. But are we doing enough in these areas? What are freedom\u2019s chances in those areas? By 1965 or 1970, will there be other Cubas in Latin America? Will Guinea and Ghana, which have now voted with the Communists frequently as newly independent countries of Africa \u2013 will there be others? Will the Congo go Communist? Will other countries? Are we doing enough in that area? And what about Asia? Is India going to win the economic struggle or is China going to win it? Who will dominate Asia in the next five or ten years? Communism? The Chinese? Or will freedom? The question which we have to decide as Americans \u2013 are we doing enough today? Is our strength and prestige rising? Do people want to be identified with us? Do they want to follow United States leadership? I don\u2019t think they do, enough. And that\u2019s what concerns me. In Africa \u2013 these countries that have newly joined the United Nations. On the question of admission of Red China, only two countries in all of Africa voted with us \u2013 Liberia and the Union of South Africa. The rest either abstained or voted against us. More countries in Asia voted against us on that question than voted with us. I believe that this struggle is going to go on, and it may be well decided in the next decade. I have seen Cuba go to the Communists. I have seen Communist influence and Castro influence rise in Latin America. I have seen us ignore Africa. There are six countries in Africa that are members of the United Nations. There isn\u2019t a single American diplomatic representative in any of those six. When Guinea became independent, the Soviet Ambassador showed up that very day. We didn\u2019t recognize them for two months; the American Ambassador didn\u2019t show up for nearly eight months. I believe that the world is changing fast. And I don\u2019t think this Administration has shown the foresight, has shown the knowledge, has been identified with the great fight which these people are waging to be free, to get a better standard of living, to live better. The average income in some of those countries is twenty-five dollars a year. The Communists say, \u201cCome with us; look what we\u2019ve done.\u201d And we\u2019ve been in \u2013 on the whole, uninterested. I think we\u2019re going to have to do better. Mr. Nixon talks about our being the strongest country in the world. I think we are today. But we were far stronger relative to the Communists five years ago, and what is of great concern is that the balance of power is in danger of moving with them. They made a breakthrough in missiles, and by nineteen sixty-one, two, and three, they will be outnumbering us in missiles. I\u2019m not as confident as he is that we will be the strongest military power by 1963. He talks about economic growth as a great indicator of freedom. I agree with him. What we do in this country, the kind of society that we build, that will tell whether freedom will be sustained around the world. And yet, in the last nine months of this year, we\u2019ve had a drop in our economic growth rather than a gain. We\u2019ve had the lowest rate of increase of economic growth in the last nine months of any major industrialized society in the world. I look up and see the Soviet flag on the moon. The fact is that the State Department polls on our prestige and influence around the world have shown such a sharp drop that up till now the State Department has been unwilling to release them. And yet they were polled by the U.S.I.A. The point of all this is, this is a struggle in which we\u2019re engaged. We want peace. We want freedom. We want security. We want to be stronger. We want freedom to gain. But I don\u2019t believe in these changing and revolutionary times this Administration has known that the world is changing \u2013 has identified itself with that change. I think the Communists have been moving with vigor \u2013 Laos, Africa, Cuba \u2013 all around the world today they\u2019re on the move. I think we have to revita1ize our society. I think we have to demonstrate to the people of the world that we\u2019re determined in this free country of ours to be first \u2013 not first if, and not first but, and not first when \u2013 but first. And when we are strong and when we are first, then freedom gains; then the prospects for peace increase; then the prospects for our society gain."}

NIXON","Text":"Our policies are very different. I think that Senator Kennedy\u2019s policies and recommendations for the handling of the Castro regime are probably the most dangers- dangerously irresponsible recommendations that he\u2019s made during the course of this campaign. In effect, what Senator Kennedy recommends is that the United States government should give help to the exiles and to those within Cuba who oppose the Castro regime \u2013 provided they are anti-Batista. Now let\u2019s just see what this means. We have five treaties with Latin America, including the one setting up the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948, in which we have agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of any other American country \u2013 and they as well have agreed to do likewise. The charter of the United Nations \u2013 its Preamble, Article I and Article II \u2013 also provide that there shall be no intervention by one nation in the internal affairs of another. Now I don\u2019t know what Senator Kennedy suggests when he says that we should help those who oppose the Castro regime, both in Cuba and without. But I do know this: that if we were to follow that recommendation, that we would lose all of our friends in Latin America, we would probably be condemned in the United Nations, and we would not accomplish our objective. I know something else. It would be an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to come in, to come into Latin America and to engage us in what would be a civil war, and possibly even worse than that. This is the major recommendation that he\u2019s made. Now, what can we do? Well, we can do what we did with Guatemala. There was a Communist dictator that we inherited from the previous Administration. We quarantined Mr. Arbenz. The result was that the Guatemalan people themselves eventually rose up and they threw him out. We are quarantining Mr. Castro today. We\u2019re quarantining him diplomatically by bringing back our Ambassador; economically by cutting off trade, and Senator Kennedy\u2019s suggestion that the trade that we cut off is not significant is just one hundred percent wrong. We are cutting off the significant items that the Cuban regime needs in order to survive. By cutting off trade, by cutting off our diplomatic relations as we have, we will quarantine this regime so that the people of Cuba themselves will take care of Mr. Castro. But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want."}

KENNEDY","Text":"Mr. Nixon uh \u2013 shows himself i- misinformed. He surely must be aware that most of the equipment and arms and resources for Castro came from the United States, flowed out of Florida and other parts of the United States to Castro in the mountains. There isn\u2019t any doubt about that, number one. Number two, I believe that if any economic sanctions against Latin America are going to be successful they have to be multilateral. They have to include the other countries of Latin America. The very minute effect of the action which has been taken this week on Cuba\u2019s economy \u2013 I believe Castro can replace those markets very easily through Latin America, through Europe, and through Eastern Europe. If the United States had stronger prestige and influence in Latin America it could persuade \u2013 as Franklin Roosevelt did in 1940 \u2013 the countries of Latin America to join in an economic quarantine of Castro. That\u2019s the only way you can bring real economic pressure on the Castro regime \u2013 and also the countries of Western Europe, Canada, Japan and the others. Number three, Castro is only the beginning of our difficulties throughout Latin America. The big struggle will be to prevent the influence of Castro spreading to other countries \u2013 Mexico, Panama, Bolivia, Colombia. We\u2019re going to have to try to provide closer ties, to associate ourselves with the great desire of these people for a better life if we\u2019re going to prevent Castro\u2019s influence from spreading throughout all of Latin America. His influence is strong enough today to prevent us from joi- getting the other countries of Latin America to join with us in economic quarantine. His influence is growing \u2013 mostly because this Administration has ignored Latin America. You yourself said, Mr. Vice President, a month ago, that if we had provided the kind of economic aid five years ago that we are now providing we might never have had Castro. Why didn\u2019t we?"}

This is a decision that the president of the United States must make. The last candidate who indicated that he knew who his cabinet was going to be was Mr. Dewey in 1948. This is a race between the Vice President and myself for the presidency of the United States. There are a good many able men who could be secretary of state. I\u2019ve made no judgment about who should be secretary of state. I think that judgment could be made after election, if I\u2019m successful. The people have to make a choice between Mr. Nixon and myself, between the Republican party and the Democratic party, between our approach to the problems which now disturb us as a nation and disturb us as a world power. The president bears the constitutional responsibility, not the secretary of state, for the conduct of foreign affairs. Some presidents have been strong in foreign policy; others have relied heavily on the secretary of state. I\u2019ve been a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; I run for the presidency with full knowledge that his great responsibility, really, given to him by the Constitution and by the force of events, is in the field of foreign affairs. I\u2019m asking the people\u2019s support as president. We will select the best man we can get. But I\u2019ve not made a judgment, and I have not narrowed down a list of three or four people, among whom would be the candidate."}

NIXON","Text":"Well Mr. Edwards, as you probably know, I have consistently answered all questions with regard to who will be in the next cabinet by saying that that is the responsibility of the next president, and it would be inappropriate to make any decisions on that or to announce any prior to the time that I had the right to do so. So that is my answer to this question. If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to use the balance of the time to respond to one of the comments that Senator Kennedy made on the previous question. Eh- He was talking about the Castro regime and what we had been eh- doing in Latin America. I would like to point out that when we look at our programs in Latin America, we find that we have appropriated five times as much for Latin America as was appropriated by the previous Administration; we find that we have two billion dollars more for the Export-Import Bank; we have a new bank for Latin America alone of a billion dollars; we have the new program which was submitted at the Bogota Conference \u2013 this new program that President Eisenhower submitted, approved by the last Congress \u2013 for five hundred million dollars. We have moved in Latin America very effectively, and I\u2019d also like to point this out: Senator Kennedy complains very appropriately about our inadequate ra- radio broadcasts for Latin America. Let me point out again that his Congress \u2013 the Democratic Congress \u2013 has cut eighty million dollars off of the Voice of America appropriations. Now, he has to get a better job out of his Congress if he\u2019s going to get us the money that we need to conduct the foreign affairs of this country in Latin America or any place else."}

NIXON","Text":"Mr. Cronkite, I naturally am aware of it, because I, of course, pay attention to everything Senator Kennedy says, as well as Senator Fulbright. Now, in this connection I want to point out that the facts simply aren\u2019t as stated. First of all, the report to which Senator Kennedy refers is one that was made many, many months ago and related particularly to the uh \u2013 period immediately after Sputnik. Second, as far as this report is concerned, I would have no objection to having it made public. Third, I would say this with regard to this report, with regard to Gallup Polls of prestige abroad and everything else that we\u2019ve been hearing about \u201cwhat about American prestige abroad\u201d: America\u2019s prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for America allow it to be. Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example \u2013 Senator Kennedy \u2013 stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight \u2013 we\u2019ve had twenty-eight successful shots, they\u2019ve had eight; when he states that we\u2019re second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I\u2019ve seen ours, and we\u2019re not; that we\u2019re second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we\u2019re way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige? Well, it can only have the effect certainly of reducing it. Well let me make one thing clear. Senator Kennedy has a responsibility to criticize those things that are wrong, but he has also a responsibility to be right in his criticism. Every one of these items that I have mentioned he\u2019s been wrong \u2013 dead wrong. And for that reason he has contributed to any lack of prestige. Finally, let me say this: as far as prestige is concerned, the first place it would show up would be in the United Nations. Now Senator Kennedy has referred to the vote on Communist China. Let\u2019s look at the vote on Hungary. There we got more votes for condemning Hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year. Let\u2019s look at the reaction eh \u2013 reaction to Khrushchev and Eisenhower at the last U.N. session. Did Khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted? Not at all. The President gained. America gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it\u2019s that that keeps the prestige of America up, not running down America the way Senator Kennedy has been running her down."}

I\u2019ve served this country for fourteen years in the Congress and before that in the service. I\u2019ve just as high a devotion, just as high an opinion. What I downgrade, Mr. Nixon, is the leadership the country is getting, not the country. Now I didn\u2019t make most of the statements that you said I made. The s- I believe the Soviet Union is first in outer space. We have \u2013 may have made more shots but the size of their rocket thrust and all the rest \u2013 you yourself said to Khrushchev, \u201cYou may be ahead of us in rocket thrust but we\u2019re ahead of you in color television\u201d in your famous discussion in the kitchen. I think that color television is not as important as rocket thrust. Secondly, I didn\u2019t say we had the worst slums in the world. I said we had too many slums. And that they are bad, and we ought to do something about them, and we ought to support housing legislation which this Administration has opposed. I didn\u2019t say we had the worst education in the world. What I said was that ten years ago, we were producing twice as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union and today they\u2019re producing twice as many as we are, and that this affects our security around the world. And fourth, I believe that the polls and other studies and votes in the United Nations and anyone reading the paper and any citizen of the United States must come to the conclusion that the United States no longer carries the same image of a vital society on the move with its brightest days ahead as it carried a decade or two decades ago. Part of that is because we\u2019ve stood still here at home, because we haven\u2019t met our problems in the United States, because we haven\u2019t had a moving economy. Part of that, as the Gallup Polls show, is because the Soviet Union made a breakthrough in outer space. Mr. George Allen, head of your Information Service, has said that that made the people of the world begin to wonder whether we were first in science. We\u2019re first in other areas of science but in space, which is the new science, we\u2019re not first."}

I think we should go back to Geneva, who\u2019s ever elected president, Mr. Nixon or myself, and try once again. If we fail then, if we\u2019re unable to come to an agreement \u2013 and I hope we can come to an agreement because it does not merely involve now the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as atomic powers. Because new breakthroughs in atomic energy technology there\u2019s some indications that by the time the next president\u2019s term of office has come to an end, there may be ten, fifteen, or twenty countries with an atomic capacity, perhaps that many testing bombs with all the effect that it could have on the atmosphere and with all the chances that more and more countries will have an atomic capacity, with more and more chance of war. So one more effort should be made. I don\u2019t think that even if that effort fails that it will be necessary to carry on tests in the atmosphere which pollute the atmosphere. They can be carried out underground, they c- could be carried on in outer space. But I believe the effort should be made once more by who\u2019s ever elected president of the United States. If we fail, it\u2019s been a great serious failure for everyone \u2013 for the human race. I hope we can succeed. But then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then we\u2019ll have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the United States, and there may have to be testing underground. I think the Atomic Energy Committee is prepared for it. There may be testing in outer space. I hope it will not be necessary for any power to resume uh \u2013 testing in the atmosphere. It\u2019s possible to detect those kind of tests. The kind of tests which you can\u2019t detect are underground or in \u2013 in uh \u2013 perhaps in outer space. So that I\u2019m hopeful we can try once more. If we fail then we must meet our responsibilities to ourselves. But I\u2019m most concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapons. China may have it by 1963, Egypt. War has been the constant companion of mankind, so to have these weapons disseminated around the world, I believe means that we\u2019re going to move through a period of hazard in the next few years. We ought to make one last effort."}

As a matter of fact, there\u2019s been a moratorium on testing as a result of the fact that we have been negotiating. I\u2019ve reached the conclusion that the Soviet Union is actually filibustering. I\u2019ve reached the conclusion, too, based on the reports that have been made, that they may be cheating. I don\u2019t think we can wait until the next president is inaugurated and then uh \u2013 select a new team and then all the months of negotiating that will take place before we reach a decision, I think that immediately after this election we should set a timetable \u2013 the next president, working with the present President, President Eisenhower \u2013 a timetable to break the Soviet filibuster. There should be no tests in the atmosphere; that rules out any fall-out. But as far as underground tests for developing peaceful uses of atomic energy, we should not allow this Soviet filibuster to continue. I think it\u2019s time for them to fish or cut bait. I think that the next president immediately after his election should sit down with the President, work out a timetable, and \u2013 get a decision on this before January of next year."}

NIXON","Text":"Well the conditions I laid out in one of our previous television debates, and it\u2019s rather difficult to be much more specific than that. Uh \u2013 First of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference. This means at the secretary of state level and at the ambassadorial level. By adequate preparation I mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda, an agenda agreed upon with the approval of the heads of state involved. Now this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation. I don\u2019t believe we should go to a summit conference unless we have such an agenda, unless we have some reasonable insur- assurance from Mr. Khrushchev that he intends seriously to negotiate on those points. Now this may seem like a rigid, inflexible position. But let\u2019s look at the other side of the coin. If we build up the hopes of the world by having a summit conference that is not adequately prepared, and then, if Mr. Khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up \u2013 as he did this one \u2013 because he isn\u2019t going to get his way \u2013 we\u2019d set back the cause of peace. We do not help it. We can, in other words, negotiate many of these items of difference between us without going to the summit. I think we have to make a greater effort than we have been making at the secretary of state level, at the ambassadorial level, to work out the differences that we have. And so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit \u2013 a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it is. When I say \u201cphony spirit,\u201d I mean phony, not because the spirit is not good on our side, but because the Soviet Union simply doesn\u2019t intend to carry out what they say. Now, these are the conditions that I can lay out. I cannot be more precise than that, because until we see what Mr. Khrushchev does and what he says uh \u2013 we cannot indicate what our plans will be."}

KENNEDY","Text":"Well, I think the president of the United States last winter indicated that before he\u2019d go to the summit in May he did last fall, he indicated that there should be some agenda, that there should be some prior agreement. He hoped that there would be uh \u2013 b- be an agreement in part in disarmament. He also expressed the hope that there should be some understanding of the general situation in Berlin. The Soviet Union refused to agree to that, and we went to the summit and it was disastrous. I believe we should not go to the summit until there is some reason to believe that a meeting of minds can be obtained on either Berlin, outer space, or general disarmament \u2013 including nuclear testing. In addition, I believe the next president in January and February should go to work in building the strength of the United States. The Soviet Union does understand strength. We arm to parley, Winston Churchill said ten years ago. If we are strong, particularly as we face a crisis over Berlin \u2013 which we may in the spring, or in the winter \u2013 it\u2019s important that we maintain our determination here; that we indicate that we\u2019re building our strength; that we are determined to protect our position; that we\u2019re determined to protect our commitment. And then I believe we should indicate our desire to live at peace with the world. But until we\u2019re strong here, until we\u2019re moving here, I believe a summit could not be successful. I hope that before we do meet, there will be preliminary agreements on those four questions, or at least two of them, or even one of them, which would warrant such a meeting. I think if we had stuck by that position last winter, we would have been in a better position in May."}

KENNEDY","Text":"One of the areas, and of course the most vulnerable area is \u2013 I have felt, has been Eastern Europe. I\u2019ve been critical of the Administration\u2019s failure to suggest policies which would make it possible for us to establish, for example, closer relations with Poland, particularly after the fifty-five-fifty-six period and the Hungarian revolution. We indicated at that time that we were not going to intervene militarily. But there was a period there when Poland demonstrated a national independence and even the Polish government moved some differn- di- distance away from the Soviet Union. I suggested that we amend our legislation so that we could enjoy closer economic ties. We received the support first of the Administration and then not, and we were defeated by one vote in the Senate. We passed the bill in the Senate this year but it didn\u2019t pass the House. I would say Eastern Europe is the area of vulnerability of the uh \u2013 s- of the Soviet Union. Secondly, the relations between Russia and China. They are now engaged in a debate over whether war is the means of Communizing the world or whether they should use subversion, infiltration, economic struggles and all the rest. No one can say what that course of action will be, but I think the next president of the United States should watch it carefully. If those two powers should split, it could have great effects throughout the entire world. Thirdly, I believe that India represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world. India started from about the same place that China did. Chinese Communists have been moving ahead the last ten years. India under a free society has been making some progress. But if India does not succeed \u2013 with her four hundred and fifty million people, if she can\u2019t make freedom work \u2013 then people around the world are going to determine \u2013 particularly in the underdeveloped world \u2013 that the only way that they can develop their resources is through the Communist system. Fourth, let me say that in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the great force on our side is the desire of people to be free. This has expressed itself in the revolts in Eastern Europe. It\u2019s expressed itself in the desire of the people of Africa to be independent of Western Europe. They want to be free. And my judgment is that they don\u2019t want to give their freedom up to become Communists. They want to stay free, independent perhaps of us, but certainly independent of the Communists. And I believe if we identify ourselves with that force, if we identify ourselves with it as Lincoln, as Wilson did, as Franklin Roosevelt did, if we become known as the friend of freedom, sustaining freedom, helping freedom, helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease, helping them build their lives, I believe in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, eventually in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East, certainly in Western Europe, we can strengthen freedom. We can make it move. We can put the Communists on the defensive."}

NIXON","Text":"First, with regard to Poland, when I talked to Mr. Gomulka, the present leader of Poland, for six hours in Warsaw last year, I learned something about their problems and particularly his. Right under the Soviet gun, with Soviet troops there, he is in a very difficult position in taking anything independent, a position which would be independent of the Soviet Union. And yet let\u2019s just see what we\u2019ve done for Poland, A half a billion dollars worth of aid has gone to Poland, primarily economic, primarily to go to the people of Poland. This should continue and it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that I can testify they have so deeply within them. In addition we can have more exchange with Poland or with any other of the Iron Curtain countries which show some desire to take a different path than the path that has been taken by the ones that are complete satellites of the Soviet Union. Now as far as the balance of the world is concerned, I of course don\u2019t have as much time as Senator Kennedy had. I would just like to s- add this one point. If we are going to have the initiative in the world, we must remember that the people of Africa and Asia and Latin America don\u2019t want to be pawns simply in a struggle between two great powers \u2013 the Soviet Union and the United States. We have to let them know that we want to help them, not because we\u2019re simply trying to save our own skins, not because we\u2019re simply trying to fight Communism; but because we care for them, because we stand for freedom, because if there were no Communism in the world, we would still fight poverty and misery and disease and tyranny. If we can get that across to the people of these countries, in this decade of the sixties, the struggle for freedom will be won."}
{"Title":"October 21, 1960 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Fourth Kennedy-Nixon Presidential Debate","Date":-290217600000,"Participants":"Kennedy-Nixon","Moderators":"QUINCY HOWE","Speaker":"MR. NIXON","Text":"I would say that the issue will stay with us as a campaign issue just as long as Senator Kennedy persists in what I think is a fundamental error. He says he supports the President\u2019s position. He says that he voted for the resolution. Well just let me point this out; he voted for the resolution in 1955 which gave the president the power to use the forces of the United States to defend Formosa and the offshore islands. But he also voted then for an amendment \u2013 which was lost, fortunately \u2013 an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p- right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on Formosa. He repeated that error in 1959, in the speech that he made. He repeated it again in a television debate that we had. Now, my point is this: Senator Kennedy has got to be consistent here. Either he\u2019s for the President and he\u2019s against the position that those who opposed the President in fifty-five and fifty-nine \u2013 and the Senator\u2019s position itself, stated the other day in our debate \u2013 either he is for the President and against that position or we simply have a disagreement here that must continue to be debated. Now if the Senator in his answer to this question will say \u201cI now will depart, or retract my previous views; I think I was wrong in I 955; I think I was wrong in 1959; and I think I was wrong in our television debate to say that we should draw a line leaving out Quemoy and Matsu \u2013 draw a line in effect abandoning these islands to the Communists;\u201d then this will be right out of the campaign because there will be no issue between us. I support the President\u2019s position. I have always opposed drawing a line. I have opposed drawing a line because I know that the moment you draw a line, that is an encouragement for the Communists to attack \u2013 to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want. And so I would hope that Senator Kennedy in his answer today would clear it up. It isn\u2019t enough for him to say \u201cI support the President\u2019s position, that I voted for the resolution.\u201d Of course, he voted for the resolution \u2013 it was virtually unanimous. But the point is, what about his error in voting for the amendment, which was not adopted, and then persisting in it in fifty-nine, persisting in it in the debate. It\u2019s very simple for him to clear it up. He can say now that he no longer believes that a line should be drawn leaving these islands out of the perimeter of defense. If he says that, this issue will not be discussed in the campaign."}
{"Title":"October 21, 1960 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Fourth Kennedy-Nixon Presidential Debate","Date":-290217600000,"Participants":"Kennedy-Nixon","Moderators":"QUINCY HOWE","Speaker":"MR. KENNEDY","Text":"Well, Mr. Nixon, to go back to 1955. The resolution commits the president in the United States, which I supported, to defend uh \u2013 Formosa, the Pescadores, and if it was his military judgment, these islands. Then the President sent a mission, composed of Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek in the spring of fifty-five to withdraw from the two islands, because they were exposed. The President was unsuccessful; Chiang Kai-shek would not withdraw. I refer to the fact that in 1958, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I\u2019m very familiar with the position that the United States took in negotiating with the Chinese Communists on these two islands. General Twining, in January, fifty-nine, described the position of the United States. The position of the United States has been that this build-up, in the words of the president, has been foolish. Mr. Herter has said these islands are indefensible. Chiang Kai-shek will not withdraw. Because he will not withdraw, because he\u2019s committed to these islands, because we\u2019ve been unable to persuade him to withdraw, we are in a very difficult position. And therefore, the President\u2019s judgment has been that we should defend the islands if, in his military judgment and the judgment of the commander in the field, the attack on these islands should be part of an overall attack on Formosa. I support that. In view of the difficulties we\u2019ve had with the islands, in view of the difficulties and disputes we\u2019ve had with Chiang Kai-shek, that\u2019s the only position we can take. That\u2019s not the position you took, however. The first position you took, when this matter first came up, was that we should draw the line and commit ourselves, as a matter of principle, to defend these islands. Not as part of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores. You showed no recognition of the Administration program to try to persuade Chiang Kai-shek for the last five years to withdraw from the islands. And I challenge you tonight to deny that the Administration has sent at least several missions to persuade Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s withdrawal from these islands."}

{"Title":"October 21, 1960 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Fourth Kennedy-Nixon Presidential Debate","Date":-290217600000,"Participants":"Kennedy-Nixon","Moderators":"QUINCY HOWE","Speaker":"MR. KENNEDY","Text":"I uh \u2013 said that I\u2019ve served this country for fourteen years. I served it uh \u2013 in the war. I\u2019m devoted to it. If I lose this election, I will continue in the Senate to try to build a stronger country. But I run because I believe this year the United States has a great opportunity to make a move forward, to make a determination here at home and around the world, that it\u2019s going to reestablish itself as a vigorous society. My judgment is that the Republican party has stood still here in the United States, and it\u2019s also stood still around the world. Uh \u2013 We\u2019re using about fifty percent of our steel capacity today. We had a recession in fifty-eight. We had a recession in fifty-four. We\u2019re not moving ahead in education the way we should. We didn\u2019t make a judgment in fifty-seven and fifty-six and fifty-five and fifty-four that outer space would be important. If we stand still here, if we appoint people to ambassadorships and positions in Washington who have a status quo outlook, who don\u2019t recognize that this is a revolutionary time, then the United States does not maintain its influence. And if we fail, the cause of freedom fails. I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again, to get our economy moving ahead, to set before the American people its goals, its unfinished business. And then throughout the world appoint the best people we can get, ambassadors who can speak the language \u2013 no mere \u2013 not merely people who made a political contribution but who can speak the language. Bring students here; let them see what kind of a country we have. Mr. Nixon said that we should not regard them as pawns in the cold war; we should identify ourselves with them. If that were true, why didn\u2019t we identify ourselves with the people of Africa? Why didn\u2019t we bring students over here? Why did we suddenly offer Congo three hundred students last June when they had the tremendous revolt? That was more than we had offered to all of Africa before from the federal government. I believe that this party \u2013 Republican party \u2013 has stood still really for twenty-five years \u2013 its leadership has. It opposed all of the programs of President Roosevelt and others \u2013 the minimum wage and for housing and economic growth and development of our natural resources, the Tennessee Valley and all the rest. And I believe that if we can get a party which believes in movement, which believes in going ahead, then we can reestablish our position in the world \u2013 strong defense, strong in economic growth, justice for our people, co- guarantee of constitutional rights, so that people will believe that we practice what we preach, and then around the world, particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which existed in Latin America at the time of Franklin Roosevelt. He was a good neighbor in Latin America because he was a good neighbor in the United States; because they saw us as a society that was compassionate, that cared about people, that was moving this country ahead. I believe it my responsibility as the leader of the Democratic party in 1960 to try to warn the American people that in this crucial time we can no longer afford to stand still. We can no longer afford to be second best. I want people all over the world to look to the United States again, to feel that we\u2019re on the move, to feel that our high noon is in the future. I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States, and that they\u2019re going to put this country back to work again. I don\u2019t believe that there is anything this country cannot do. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any burden, or any responsibility, that any American would not assume to protect his country, to protect our security, to advance the cause of freedom. And I believe it incumbent upon us now to do that. Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that that generation of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny. I believe in 1960 and sixty-one and two and three we have a rendezvous with destiny. And I believe it incumbent upon us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom; and to do that, we must give this country leadership and we must get America moving again."}

NIXON","Text":"Senator Kennedy has said tonight again what he has said several times in the course of this \u2013 these debates and in the campaign, that American is standing still. America is not standing still. It has not been standing still. And let\u2019s set the record straight right now by looking at the record, as Al Smith used to say. He talks about housing. We built more houses in the last seven years than in any Administration and thirty percent more than in the previous Administration. We talk about schools \u2013 three times as many classrooms built in the past Administration \u2013 and Eisenhower \u2013 than under the Truman Administration. Let\u2019s talk about civil rights. More progress in the past eight years than in the whole eighty years before. He talks about the progress in the field of slum clearance and the like. We find four times as many projects undertaken and completed in this Administration than in the previous one. Anybody that says America has been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn\u2019t been traveling in America. He\u2019s been in some other country. Let\u2019s get that straight right away. Now the second point we have to understand is this, however. America has not been standing still. But America cannot stand pat. We can\u2019t stand pat for the reason that we\u2019re in a race, as I\u2019ve indicated. We can\u2019t stand pat because it is essential with the conflict that we have around the world that we not just hold our own, that we not keep just freedom for ourselves. It is essential that we extend freedom, extend it to all the world. And this means more than what we\u2019ve been doing. It means keeping America even stronger militarily than she is. It means seeing that our economy moves forward even faster than it has. It means making more progress in civil rights than we have so that we can be a splendid example for all the world to see \u2013 a democracy in action at its best. Now, looking at the other parts of the world \u2013 South America \u2013 talking about our record and the previous one. We had a good neighbor policy, yes. It sounded fine. But let\u2019s look at it. There were eleven dictators when we came into power in 1953 in Latin America. There are only three left. Let\u2019s look at Africa. Twenty new countries in Africa during the course of this Administration. Not one of them selected a Communist government. All of them voted for freedom \u2013 a free type of government. Does this show that Communism has the bigger pull, or freedom has the bigger pull? Am I trying to indicate that we have no problems in Africa or Latin America or Asia? Of course not. What I am trying to indicate is that the tide of history\u2019s on our side, and that we can keep it on our side, because we\u2019re on the right side. We\u2019re on the side of freedom. We\u2019re on the side of justice against the forces of slavery, against the forces of injustice. But we aren\u2019t going to move America forward and we aren\u2019t going to be able to lead the world to win this struggle for freedom if we have a permanent inferiority complex about American achievements. Because we are first in the world in space, as I\u2019ve indicated; we are first in science; we are first in education, and we\u2019re going to move even further ahead with the kind of leadership that we can provide in these years ahead. One other point I would make: what could you do? Senator Kennedy and I are candidates for the presidency of the United States. And in the years to come it will be written that one or the other of us was elected and that he was or was not a great president. What will determine whether Senator Kennedy or I, if I am elected, was a great president? It will not be our ambition that will determine it, because greatness is not something that is written on a campaign poster. It will be determined to the extent that we represent the deepest ideals, the highest feelings and faith of the American people. In other words, the next president, as he leads America and the free world, can be only as great as the American people are great. And so I say in conclusion, keep America\u2019s faith strong. See that the young people of America, particularly, have faith in the ideals of freedom and faith in God, which distinguishes us from the atheistic materialists who oppose us."}

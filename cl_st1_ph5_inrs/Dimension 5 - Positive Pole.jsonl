So here\u2019s what I\u2019ve done since I\u2019ve been president. We have increased oil production to the highest levels in 16 years. Natural gas production is the highest it\u2019s been in decades. We have seen increases in coal production and coal employment. But what I\u2019ve also said is we can\u2019t just produce traditional source of energy. We\u2019ve also got to look to the future. That\u2019s why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars. That means that in the middle of the next decade, any car you buy, you\u2019re going to end up going twice as far on a gallon of gas. That\u2019s why we doubled clean \u2014 clean energy production like wind and solar and biofuels. And all these things have contributed to us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in 16 years. Now, I want to build on that. And that means, yes, we still continue to open up new areas for drilling. We continue to make it a priority for us to go after natural gas. We\u2019ve got potentially 600,000 jobs and 100 years worth of energy right beneath our feet with natural gas. And we can do it in an environmentally sound way. But we\u2019ve also got to continue to figure out how we have efficiency energy, because ultimately that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to reduce demand and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to keep gas prices lower. Now, Governor Romney will say he\u2019s got an all-of-the-above plan, but basically his plan is to let the oil companies write the energy policies. So he\u2019s got the oil and gas part, but he doesn\u2019t have the clean energy part. And if we are only thinking about tomorrow or the next day and not thinking about 10 years from now, we\u2019re not going to control our own economic future. Because China, Germany, they\u2019re making these investments. And I\u2019m not going to cede those jobs of the future to those countries. I expect those new energy sources to be built right here in the United States. That\u2019s going to help Jeremy get a job. It\u2019s also going to make sure that you\u2019re not paying as much for gas."}

And the president\u2019s right in terms of the additional oil production, but none of it came on federal land. As a matter of fact, oil production is down 14 percent this year on federal land, and gas production was down 9 percent. Why? Because the president cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands, and in federal waters. So where\u2019d the increase come from? Well a lot of it came from the Bakken Range in North Dakota. What was his participation there? The administration brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil, this massive new resource we have. And what was the cost? 20 or 25 birds were killed and brought out a migratory bird act to go after them on a criminal basis. Look, I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables. I believe very much in our renewable capabilities; ethanol, wind, solar will be an important part of our energy mix. But what we don\u2019t need is to have the president keeping us from taking advantage of oil, coal and gas. This has not been Mr. Oil, or Mr. Gas, or Mr. Coal. Talk to the people that are working in those industries. I was in coal country. People grabbed my arms and said, \u201cPlease save my job.\u201d The head of the EPA said, \u201cYou can\u2019t build a coal plant. You\u2019ll virtually \u2014 it\u2019s virtually impossible given our regulations.\u201d When the president ran for office, he said if you build a coal plant, you can go ahead, but you\u2019ll go bankrupt. That\u2019s not the right course for America. Let\u2019s take advantage of the energy resources we have, as well as the energy sources for the future. And if we do that, if we do what I\u2019m planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, North America energy independence within eight years, you\u2019re going to see manufacturing jobs come back. Because our energy is low cost, that are already beginning to come back because of our abundant energy. I\u2019ll get America and North America energy independent. I\u2019ll do it by more drilling, more permits and licenses. We\u2019re going to bring that pipeline in from Canada. How in the world the president said no to that pipeline? I will never know. This is about bringing good jobs back for the middle class of America, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. CROWLEY: Mr. President, let me just see if I can move you to the gist of this question, which is, are we looking at the new normal? I can tell you that tomorrow morning, a lot of people in Hempstead will wake up and fill up and they will find that the price of gas is over $4 a gallon. Is it within the purview of the government to bring those prices down, or are we looking at the new normal?"}

What I\u2019ve had as a basic commitment since I\u2019ve been President is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It can only be done in two ways: one, to conserve energy \u2013 to stop the waste of energy \u2013 and, secondly, to produce more American energy. We\u2019ve been very successful in both cases. We\u2019ve now reduced the importing of foreign oil in the last year alone by one-third. We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same date just a year ago. This commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our nation in the future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels, yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy, yes; and also to produce the traditional kinds of American energy. We will drill more oil and gas wells this year than any year in history. We\u2019ll produce more coal this year than any year in history. We are exporting more coal this year than any year in history. And we have an opportunity now with improved transportation systems and improved loading facilities in our ports, to see a very good opportunity on a world international market, to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source. This exciting future will not only give us more energy security, but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that we\u2019ve put into effect."}

John McCain has voted 20 times in the last decade-and-a-half against funding alternative energy sources, clean energy sources, wind, solar, biofuels.

We believe \u2014 Barack Obama believes by investing in clean coal and safe nuclear, we can not only create jobs in wind and solar here in the United States, we can export it. China is building one to three new coal-fired plants burning dirty coal per week. It\u2019s polluting not only the atmosphere but the West Coast of the United States. We should export the technology by investing in clean coal technology. We should be creating jobs. John McCain has voted 20 times against funding alternative energy sources and thinks, I guess, the only answer is drill, drill, drill. Drill we must, but it will take 10 years for one drop of oil to come out of any of the wells that are going to begun to be drilled. In the meantime, we\u2019re all going to be in real trouble."}

We\u2019re actually drilling more on public lands than in the previous administration and my \u2014 the previous president was an oil man. And natural gas isn\u2019t just appearing magically. We\u2019re encouraging it and working with the industry. And when I hear Governor Romney say he\u2019s a big coal guy, I mean, keep in mind, when \u2014 Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts, you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, \u201cThis plant kills,\u201d and took great pride in shutting it down. And now suddenly you\u2019re a big champion of coal. So what I\u2019ve tried to do is be consistent. With respect to something like coal, we made the largest investment in clean coal technology, to make sure that even as we\u2019re producing more coal, we\u2019re producing it cleaner and smarter. Same thing with oil, same thing with natural gas. And the proof is our oil imports are down to the lowest levels in 20 years. Oil production is up, natural gas production is up, and, most importantly, we\u2019re also starting to build cars that are more efficient. And that\u2019s creating jobs. That means those cars can be exported, \u2019cause that\u2019s the demand around the world, and it also means that it\u2019ll save money in your pocketbook.

In January of uh \u2013 1975 I submitted to the Congress and to the American people the first comprehensive energy program recommended by any president. It called for an increase in the production of energy in the United States. It called for uh \u2013 conservation measures so that we would save the energy that we have. If you\u2019re going to increase domestic oil and gas production \u2013 and we have to \u2013 you have to give those producers an opportunity to uh \u2013 develop their land or their wells. I recommended to the Congress that we should increase production in this country from six hundred million tons a year to twel- a- a billion two hundred million tons by 1985. In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground; we have to improve our utilization of coal \u2013 make it more efficient, make it cleaner. In addition we uh \u2013 have to expand our research and development. In my program for energy independence we have increased, for example, solar energy research from about $84 million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year. We\u2019re going as fast as the experts say we should. In nuclear power we have increased the research and development, uh \u2013 under the Energy Research and Development Agency uh \u2013 very substantially, to insure that our ener- uh \u2013 nuclear power plants are safer, that they are more efficient, and that we have adequate safeguards.

I think I know the \u2013 the uh capabilities and limitations of atomic power. But the energy \u2013 uh policy of our nation is one that uh has not yet been established under this administration. I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy except us. We have seen uh \u2013 the Federal Energy Agency established, for instance. Uh \u2013 in the crisis of 1973 it was supposed to be a temporary agency, uh now it\u2019s permanent, it\u2019s enormous, it\u2019s growing every day. I think the Wall Street Journal uh reported not too long ago they have a hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people its own existence. We\u2019ve got to have a \u2013 a firm way to handle the energy question. The reorganization proposal that I have put forward is one uh first step. In addition to that, we need to have \u2013 uh a realization that we\u2019ve got uh about thirty-five years worth of oil left in the whole world. We\u2019re gonna run out of oil. When Mr. Nixon made his famous uh speech on Operation Independence we were importing about 35 percent of our oil. Now we\u2019ve increased that amount 25 percent. We now import about 44 percent of our oil. We need to shift from oil to coal. We need to concentrate our research and development effort on uh coal burning and extraction, with safer mines, but also it\u2019s clean burning. We need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures. And then as a last resort only, continue to use atomic power. I would certainly uh \u2013 not cut out atomic power altogether. We can\u2019t afford to give up that opportunity until later. But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained. For instance, some that have been forgotten; we need to have the reactor core \u2013 below ground level, the entire power plant that uses atomic uh \u2013 power tightly sealed and a heavy \u2013 heavy vacuum maintained. There ought to be a standardized design. There ought to be a full-time uh \u2013 atomic energy specialist, independent of the power company in the control room, full time, twenty-four hours a day, to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops. These kinds of uh \u2013 procedures, along with evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated. So, shift from oil to coal, emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power, strict conservation measures, not yield every time that the special interest groups uh \u2013 put pressure on the president like uh this administration has done, and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strictest possible safety precautions. That\u2019s the best overall energy policy in the brief time we have to discuss it."}

Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and I\u2019m for it. But I do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the present energy problem, because all you\u2019re doing then is staving off, by a short time, the day when you would come to the end of the energy supply. To say that we are limited, and at a dangerous point in this country with regard to energy, I think, is to ignore the fact. The fact is, that in today\u2019s oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used. But it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground. And this is known oil reserves, known supplies. There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago. We have a coal supply that is equal to 50% of the world\u2019s coal supply, good for centuries, in this country. I grant you that prices may go up, because as you go further and have to go deeper, you are adding to the cost of production. We have nuclear power, which, I believe, with the safest. the most stringent of safety requirements, could meet our energy needs for the next couple of decades while we go forward exploring the areas of solar power and other forms of energy that might be renewable and that would not be exhaustible. All of these things can be done. When you stop and think that we are only drilling on 2%. have leased only 2% of the possible. possibility for oil of the continental shelf around the United States; when you stop to think that the government has taken over 100 million acres of land out of circulation in Alaska, alone, that is believed by geologists to contain much in the line of minerals and energy sources, then I think it is the Government, and the Government with its own restrictions and regulations, that is creating the energy crisis. That we are, indeed, an energy-rich nation."}

Obviously, I disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to Russians going into Georgia. I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable. And, absolutely, I wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on Georgia, and that\u2019s why I was the first to say that we have to rebuild the Georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild. Because part of Russia\u2019s intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more. Two points I think are important to think about when it comes to Russia. Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems. So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory. That made no sense whatsoever. And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over. That wasn\u2019t done. But had it been done, it\u2019s possible we could have avoided the issue. The second point I want to make is \u2014 is the issue of energy. Russia is in part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as Senator McCain mentioned. That means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil \u2014 25 percent of the world\u2019s oil \u2014 have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with Russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states we\u2019ve talked about, Iran, Venezuela. And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world\u2019s oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world\u2019s oil. So we can\u2019t simply drill our way out of the problem. What we\u2019re going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology. And, you know, I\u2019ve got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that. And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record. Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel. And so we \u2014 we \u2014 we\u2019ve got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump \u2014 and, you know, winter\u2019s coming and home heating oil \u2014 as it is our national security and the issue of climate change that\u2019s so important."}

They\u2019ll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous. But we are putting our energy companies out of business. We have to bring back our workers. You take a look at what\u2019s happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies. We have to guard our energy companies. We have to make it possible. The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business. And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they\u2019re doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business. It\u2019s a disgrace."}

I\u2019m going to ask the Congress for $2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal technologies in the world. My answer to you is in the short-term we need to get after it here in America. We need to explore our resources and we need to develop our reservoirs of domestic production. We also need to have a hemispheric energy policy where Canada, Mexico and the United States come together. I brought this up recently with Vincent Fox the newly elected president in Mexico, he\u2019s a man I know from Mexico. I talked to him about how best to expedite the exploration of natural gas in Mexico and transport it up to the United States so we become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil. This is a major problem facing America. The administration did not deal with it. It\u2019s time for a new administration to deal with the energy problem."}

My assessment is that there is no comprehensive energy policy today. That as a nation, we are in trouble because the administration has not addressed these issues. We have the prospects of brownouts in California. We have a potential home heating oil crisis in the northeast. We have gasoline price rises in various other places. For years now the administration has talked about reducing our dependence on foreign sources of oil, but they haven\u2019t done it. In fact, we\u2019ve gone exactly in the opposite direction. We have the lowest rate of domestic production of oil now in 46 years. You have to go back to 1954 to find a time when we produced as little oil as we do today. Our imports are at an all-time record high. In June we imported almost 12 million barrels of oil a day. That means we are more subject to the wide fluctuations and swings in price. We have other problems. We don\u2019t have refinery capacity. We haven\u2019t built a new refinery in this country for over ten years. They\u2019re operating at 96% or 97% capacity. Even with more crude available they\u2019re probably not going to be able to do very much by way of producing additional home heating oil for this winter. We have a growing problem with our growing dependence on foreign sources of energy. That will allways be the case but we ought to be able to shift the trend and begin to move it in the right direction. We need to do a lot more about generating the capacity for power here at home. We need to get on with the business and we think we can do it very safely in an environmentally sound manner. We don\u2019t think we ought to buy into this false choice that somehow we cannot develop energy resources without being cautious with the environment. We can. We have the technology to do it and we ought to do it. We do support the low income energy assistance program. We think it\u2019s important that senior citizens don\u2019t suffer this winter, but we need to get on to the business of having a plan to develop our domestic energy resources in producing more supplies, and this administration hasn\u2019t produced them."}

And what I want to do, is build on the five million jobs that we\u2019ve created over the last 30 months in the private sector alone. And there are a bunch of things we can do to make sure your future is bright. Number one, I want to build manufacturing jobs in this country again. Now when Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt. I said we\u2019re going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry and it\u2019s come surging back. I want to do that in industries, not just in Detroit, but all across the country and that means we change our tax code so we\u2019re giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the United States and creating jobs here. It also means we\u2019re helping them and small businesses to export all around the world to new markets. Number two, we\u2019ve got to make sure that we have the best education system in the world. And the fact that you\u2019re going to college is great, but I want everybody to get a great education and we\u2019ve worked hard to make sure that student loans are available for folks like you, but I also want to make sure that community colleges are offering slots for workers to get retrained for the jobs that are out there right now and the jobs of the future. Number three, we\u2019ve got to control our own energy. Now, not only oil and natural gas, which we\u2019ve been investing in; but also, we\u2019ve got to make sure we\u2019re building the energy source of the future, not just thinking about next year, but ten years from now, 20 years from now. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve invested in solar and wind and biofuels, energy efficient cars. We\u2019ve got to reduce our deficit, but we\u2019ve got to do it in a balanced way. Asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more along with cuts so that we can invest in education like yours. And let\u2019s take the money that we\u2019ve been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild America, roads, bridges schools.

We also have a short-term strategy. To deal with exactly the kind of ups and downs of energy prices. I know it was controversial, but Al Gore and I believed it was important in the short-term to reach into the strategic petroleum reserve, take some of the oil we have, put it in the market, show the big oil companies and the OPEC oil-producing countries that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got some resources with which we can fight back. We aren\u2019t going to lay back and let them roll over our economy. We did it also because gasoline prices were rising and home heating oil inventories were real low. Both of our tickets agree on LIHEAP keeping the low income housing assistance program, but our opponents offer no assistance to middle-class families hit by rising gas prices and a shortage of home heating oil. The fact is that since the reserve was opened the price of oil on world markets has dropped $6 a barrel. That\u2019s a good result and I\u2019m proud of it."}

And it focuses not only on increasing the supply, which I think we have to do, but also on working on the consumption side. Now, in the short-term we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price from OPEC when they want to raise the price. And in the long-term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy. And domestic sources that are cleaner and better. And I\u2019m proposing a plan that will give tax credits and tax incentives for the rapid development of new kinds of cars and trucks and buses and factories and boilers and furnaces that don\u2019t have as much pollution, that don\u2019t burn as much energy, and that help us get out on the cutting edge of the new technologies that will create millions of new jobs.

Now, another big difference is Governor Bush is proposing to open up some of our most precious environmental treasures, like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for the big oil companies to go in and start producing oil there.

I think that\u2019s about a realistic timeframe. And this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face. Obviously, we\u2019ve got an immediate crisis right now. But nothing is more important than us no longer borrowing $700 billion or more from China and sending it to Saudi Arabia. It\u2019s mortgaging our children\u2019s future. Now, from the start of this campaign, I\u2019ve identified this as one of my top priorities and here is what I think we have to do. Number one, we do need to expand domestic production and that means, for example, telling the oil companies the 68 million acres that they currently have leased that they\u2019re not drilling, use them or lose them. And I think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil. But understand, we only have three to four percent of the world\u2019s oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world\u2019s oil, which means that we can\u2019t drill our way out of the problem. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve focused on putting resources into solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal. These have been priorities of mine since I got to the Senate, and it is absolutely critical that we develop a high fuel efficient car that\u2019s built not in Japan and not in South Korea, but built here in the United States of America. We invented the auto industry and the fact that we have fallen so far behind is something that we have to work on. Now I just want to make one last point because Senator McCain mentioned NAFTA and the issue of trade and that actually bears on this issue. I believe in free trade. But I also believe that for far too long, certainly during the course of the Bush administration with the support of Senator McCain, the attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement. And NAFTA doesn\u2019t have \u2014 did not have enforceable labor agreements and environmental agreements. And what I said was we should include those and make them enforceable. In the same way that we should enforce rules against China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper. And when it comes to South Korea, we\u2019ve got a trade agreement up right now, they are sending hundreds of thousands of South Korean cars into the United States. That\u2019s all good. We can only get 4,000 to 5,000 into South Korea. That is not free trade. We\u2019ve got to have a president who is going to be advocating on behalf of American businesses and American workers and I make no apology for that."}

And it is absolutely critical that we understand this is not just a challenge, it\u2019s an opportunity, because if we create a new energy economy, we can create five million new jobs, easily, here in the United States. It can be an engine that drives us into the future the same way the computer was the engine for economic growth over the last couple of decades. And we can do it, but we\u2019re going to have to make an investment. The same way the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out, for defense purposes, how to communicate, we\u2019ve got to understand that this is a national security issue, as well. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to make some investments and I\u2019ve called for investments in solar, wind, geothermal. Contrary to what Senator McCain keeps on saying, I favor nuclear power as one component of our overall energy mix. But this is another example where I think it is important to look at the record. Senator McCain and I actually agree on something. He said a while back that the big problem with energy is that for 30 years, politicians in Washington haven\u2019t done anything. What Senator McCain doesn\u2019t mention is he\u2019s been there 26 of them. And during that time, he voted 23 times against alternative fuels, 23 times. So it\u2019s easy to talk about this stuff during a campaign, but it\u2019s important for us to understand that it requires a sustained effort from the next president. One last point I want to make on energy. Senator McCain talks a lot about drilling, and that\u2019s important, but we have three percent of the world\u2019s oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world\u2019s oil. So what that means is that we can\u2019t simply drill our way out of the problem. And we\u2019re not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global warming. We\u2019re going to have to come up with alternatives, and that means that the United States government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like China that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week. We\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re giving them the energy that they need or helping them to create the energy that they need."}

I\u2019d like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece. First of all, I don\u2019t have a $5 trillion tax cut. I don\u2019t have a tax cut of a scale that you\u2019re talking about. My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But I\u2019m not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people. High-income people are doing just fine in this economy. They\u2019ll do fine whether you\u2019re president or I am. The people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans. Under the president\u2019s policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. They\u2019re just being crushed. Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. This is a \u2014 this is a tax in and of itself. I\u2019ll call it the economy tax. It\u2019s been crushing. At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president. Electric rates are up. Food prices are up. Health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family. Middle-income families are being crushed. And so the question is how to get them going again. And I\u2019ve described it. It\u2019s energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business. Those are the \u2014 the cornerstones of my plan. But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I\u2019ll just note. First, education. I agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy. But our training programs right now, we\u2019ve got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. We\u2019ve got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them. The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down. And I do, both for corporations and for individuals. But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth. The third area, energy. Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up. But not due to his policies. In spite of his policies. Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half. If I\u2019m president, I\u2019ll double them, and also get the \u2014 the oil from offshore and Alaska. And I\u2019ll bring that pipeline in from Canada. And, by the way, I like coal. I\u2019m going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like it\u2019s getting crushed by your policies. I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs. And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, I\u2019m not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the \u2014 the revenues going to the government. My \u2014 my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit. But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans. And I \u2014 and to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans. So any \u2014 any language to the contrary is simply not accurate. LEHRER: Mr. President?"}

And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right? We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels. And I think that\u2019s an important transition. We\u2019ve got to remain energy-independent. It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East. We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that. So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem. And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses. But I also want to be sure that we don\u2019t leave people behind. That\u2019s why I\u2019m the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out. A lot of them lost their lives. They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered our factories. I don\u2019t want to walk away from them. So we\u2019ve got to do something for them."}

When we talk about energy, we have to consider the need to do all that we can to allow this nation to become energy independent. It\u2019s a nonsensical position that we are in when we have domestic supplies of energy all over this great land. And East Coast politicians who don\u2019t allow energy-producing states like Alaska to produce these, to tap into them, and instead we\u2019re relying on foreign countries to produce for us. We\u2019re circulating about $700 billion a year into foreign countries, some who do not like America \u2014 they certainly don\u2019t have our best interests at heart \u2014 instead of those dollars circulating here, creating tens of thousands of jobs and allowing domestic supplies of energy to be tapped into and start flowing into these very, very hungry markets. Energy independence is the key to this nation\u2019s future, to our economic future, and to our national security. So when we talk about energy plans, it\u2019s not just about who got a tax break and who didn\u2019t. And we\u2019re not giving oil companies tax breaks, but it\u2019s about a heck of a lot more than that. Energy independence is the key to America\u2019s future."}

There\u2019s been a consistent policy on the part of this administration to lower or delay enforcement of air pollution standards and water pollution standards. And under both President Nixon and Ford, monies have been impounded that would\u2019ve gone to uh \u2013 cities and others to control uh \u2013 water pollution. We have no energy policy. We, I think, are the only developed nation in the world that has no comprehensive energy policy, to permit us to plan in an orderly way how to shift from increasing the scarce uh \u2013 energy uh \u2013 forms: oil, and have research and development concentrated on the increased use of coal, which I strongly favor.

First, we\u2019ve got to improve our education system and we\u2019ve made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools. We\u2019ve got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers. So now I want to hire another 100,000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now. And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people. When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent. But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States. On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we\u2019ve got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than they\u2019ve been in years. But I also believe that we\u2019ve got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments. So all of this is possible. Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code? And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments? And this is where there\u2019s a difference, because Governor Romney\u2019s central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut \u2014 on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts \u2014 that\u2019s another trillion dollars \u2014 and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn\u2019t asked for. That\u2019s $8 trillion. How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign."}

The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall. There are hundreds of thousands of them. They really don\u2019t \u2013 they\u2019re not able to control their market very well. They bring their crops in or their livestock in, many of them about the same time. They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs \u2013 a few large companies in many cases \u2013 and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place. I think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture. And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse. The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States. The automobile industry is the number one market for steel. So if the farmers\u2019 economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country. So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one. Secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance. The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh \u2013 surpluses \u2013 nine billion dollars worth. We\u2019ve had a uh \u2013 higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years. I think that this farm policy has failed. In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance. And that can only be done through governmental action. I therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported, that the federal government, after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity, attempt to bring supply and demand into balance \u2013 attempt effective production controls \u2013 so that we won\u2019t have that five or six per cent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent. I think Mr. Benson\u2019s program has failed. And I must say, after reading the Vice President\u2019s speech before the farmers, as he read mine, I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s very much different from Mr. Benson\u2019s. I don\u2019t think it provides effective governmental controls. I think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years, which was Mr. Benson\u2019s theory. I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future."}

The mines are closed down; there are 22000 miners out of work. Most of this is due to regulations which either interfere with the mining of it or prevent the burning of it:. With our modern technology, yes, we can burn our coal within the limits of the Clean Air Act. I think, as technology improves, we\u2019ll be able to do even better with that. The other thing is that we have only leased out \u2013 begun to explore \u2013 2% of our outer continental shelf for oil, where it is believed, by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy, that there are vast supplies yet to be found. Our Government has, in the last year or so, taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were \u2013 well, they were public lands subject to multiple use \u2013 exploration for minerals and so forth. It is believed that probably 70% of the potential oil in the United States is probably hidden in those lands, and no one is allowed to even go and explore to find out if it is there. This is particularly true of the recent efforts to shut down part of Alaska. Nuclear power: There were 36 power plants planned in this country. And let me add the word safety; it must be done with the utmost of safety. But 32 of those have given up and canceled their plans to build, and again, because Government regulations and permits, and so forth, take \u2013 make it take \u2013 more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the United States as it does to build one in Japan or in Western Europe.

That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s important for us to get loan guarantees to the automakers, but we do have to hold them responsible as well to start producing the highly fuel-efficient cars of the future. And Detroit had dragged its feet too long in terms of getting that done. It\u2019s going to be one of my highest priorities because transportation accounts for about 30 percent of our total energy consumption. If we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs all across America, including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century."}

I agree with what I think is the major premise of your question, sir, that we are going to have to create a new conservation ethic in the minds of the American people. and that\u2019s simply why I proposed, 15 months ago, the emergency excise tax on gasoline that I did. I did it as a security measure to be sure, because I would rather see us reduce the consumption of imported oil than have to send American boys to fight in the Persian Gulf. But at the same time, I think it\u2019s going to take a dramatic measure of that kind to convince the American people that we will have to reduce the use of the private automobile. We simply cannot have people sitting one behind the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams going in and out of our great cities. We are going to have to resort to van pooling, to car pooling. We\u2019re going to have to develop better community transportation systems, so that with buses and light rail, we can replace the private automobile in those places where it clearly is not energy-efficient. I think that, with respect to housing, when we are consuming, even though our per capita income today is about the same as that of the Federal Republic of Germany, we are consuming about, by a factor of two, the amount of energy that they consume in that country. Surely, there are things that we can do in the retrofitting, ;n the redesign of our homes, not only of our houses, but of our commercial structures, as well, that will make it possible for us to achieve. According to one study that was published a short time ago \u2013 the Harvard Business School study \u2013 indicated that just in the commercial sector alone of the economy, we could save between 30% and 40% of the energy that we consume in this country today. So I think, yes, we will have to change in a very appreciable way, some of the lifestyles that we now enjoy."}

The problem is accurately stated. No matter how strong we are economically, if we remain dependent on a source of energy that is outside our control, we\u2019re not going to be as strong as we should be. Others around the world can effectively yank our chain, and we cannot allow that to continue to happen. I\u2019m afraid that our opponent\u2019s response to this is one-sided, and it is essentially to develop the resources within the United States almost regardless of where. I\u2019m against drilling in the Arctic Refuge. This is one of the most beautiful, pristine places that the good Lord has created on earth. It happens to be within the United States of America. It\u2019s not worth it to do that for what seems to be the possibility of six months\u2019 worth of oil, seven to 12 years from now. That\u2019s not much of a response to the immediate problem that gasoline consumers and home heating oil customers are facing this winter. There are more resources within the United States that we can develop. This isn\u2019t mentioned much and appreciated much. In the last eight years drilling for gas on federal lands has gone up 60% and it\u2019s been done in an environmentally protected way. The administration has encouraged the drilling for deep gas and oil going on in the western Gulf today. The answer here is new technology that will create millions of new jobs. Let me just say this. If we can get three miles more per gallon from our cars we\u2019ll get a \u2014 we\u2019ll save 1 million barrels of oil a day, which is exactly what the refuge at its best in Alaska would produce. The choice to me is clear. We have to develop fuel cells, alternative energy, encourage people to conserve and to be efficient."}

And President Bush did some smart things at the outset, but one of the opportunities that was missed was, when he spoke to the American people, he said, \u201cGo out and shop.\u201d That wasn\u2019t the kind of call to service that I think the American people were looking for. And so it\u2019s important to understand that the \u2014 I think the American people are hungry for the kind of leadership that is going to tackle these problems not just in government, but outside of government. And let\u2019s take the example of energy, which we already spoke about. There is going to be the need for each and every one of us to start thinking about how we use energy. I believe in the need for increased oil production. We\u2019re going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling. It includes telling the oil companies, that currently have 68 million acres that they\u2019re not using, that either you use them or you lose them. We\u2019re going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy. But each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes, in our buildings. And one of the things I want to do is make sure that we\u2019re providing incentives so that you can buy a fuel efficient car that\u2019s made right here in the United States of America, not in Japan or South Korea, making sure that you are able to weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient.

Because we ended the war in Iraq, we were able to refocus our attention on not only the terrorist threat, but also beginning a transition process in Afghanistan. It also allowed us to refocus on alliances and relationships that had been neglected for a decade. And Governor Romney, our alliances have never been stronger, in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel, where we have unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation, including dealing with the Iranian threat. But what we also have been able to do is position ourselves so we can start rebuilding America, and that\u2019s what my plan does. Making sure that we\u2019re bringing manufacturing back to our shores so that we\u2019re creating jobs here, as we\u2019ve done with the auto industry, not rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas. Making sure that we\u2019ve got the best education system in the world, including retraining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow. Doing everything we can to control our own energy. We\u2019ve cut our oil imports to the lowest level in two decades because we\u2019ve developed oil and natural gas. But we also have to develop clean energy technologies that will allow us to cut our exports in half by 2020. That\u2019s the kind of leadership that we need to show. And we\u2019ve got to make sure that we reduce our deficit. Unfortunately, Governor Romney\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t do it. We\u2019ve got to do it in a responsible way by cutting out spending we don\u2019t need, but also asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more.

I was just at a coal facility, where some 1,200 people lost their jobs. The right course for America is to have a true all-of-the-above policy. I don\u2019t think anyone really believes that you\u2019re a person who\u2019s going to be pushing for oil and gas and coal. You\u2019ll get your chance in a moment. I\u2019m still speaking."}

Well first, I\u2019m very proud of our record on the environment and on conservation. According to all of the best estimates, our, our air and land are cleaner than any time ever recorded. And our water is among the cleanest in the world. And just a little while ago, the president signed the Outdoors Act, the largest investment in our public lands and public parks in 100 years. So, President Trump has made a commitment to conservation and to the environment. Now with regard to climate change, the climate is changing. But the issue is, what\u2019s the cause and what do we do about it. President Trump has made it clear that we\u2019re going to continue to listen to the science. Now Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, would put us back in the Paris Climate Accord. They\u2019d impose the Green New Deal, which would crush American energy, would increase the energy cost of American families in their homes and literally would crush American jobs. President Trump and I believe that the progress that we have made in a cleaner environment has been happening precisely because we have a strong free market economy. You know what\u2019s remarkable is the United States has reduced CO2 more than the countries that are still in the Paris Climate Accord, but we\u2019ve done it through innovation. And we\u2019ve done it through natural gas and fracking, which, Senator, the American people can go look at the record. I know Joe Biden says otherwise now, as you do, but the both of you repeatedly committed to abolishing fossil fuel and banning fracking."}

(Laughter and applause) I must say, when they talk about Boston Harbor and he says he hasn\u2019t done anything, the facts are he has a $6-billion program under way on waste treatment. And it was this administration, their administration, that cut out the money early on to be able to clean up water, and made it impossible to move ahead at that time on Boston Harbor. We are the authors, the Democratic Party, of Clean Air, of Clean Water, of the superfund. I am one who played a very major role in passing the superfund legislation. And every environmental organization that I know, every major one, has now endorsed the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket. And I am one who has just received the environmental award in Texas for the work I\u2019ve done to clean up the bays, to clean up the water, off the coast of Texas. No, I think we know well who\u2019s going to help clean up this environment. The record is there, the history is there. And Dukakis and Bentsen will be committed to that. (Applause)"}

You know, Japan and Germany are both opening proclaiming to the world now that the biggest new market in the history of world business is the market for the new products and technologies that foster economic progress without environmental destruction. Why is the Japanese business organization \u2014 the largest one they have, the Ki Den Ren (phonetic), arguing for tougher environmental standards than those embodied in US law? Why is MITI \u2014 their trade organization \u2014 calling on all Japanese corporations everywhere in the world to exceed by as much as possible the environmental standards of every country in which they\u2019re operating? Well, maybe they\u2019re just dumb about business competition. But maybe they know something that George Bush and Dan Quayle don\u2019t know \u2014 that the future will call for greater efficiency and greater environmental efficiency. This is a value an issue that touches my basic values. I\u2019m taught in my religious tradition that we are given dominion over the Earth, but we\u2019re required to be good stewards of the Earth, and that means to take care of it. We\u2019re not doing that now under the Bush-Quayle policies. They have gutted the Clean Air Act. They have broken his pledge to be the environmental president. Bill Clinton and I will change that."}

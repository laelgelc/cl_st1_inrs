In the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln said the question was whether this nation could exist half-slave or half-free. In the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half-slave or half-free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, in the direction of the road that we are taking, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery. I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain. We discuss tonight domestic issues, but I would not want that to be any implication to be given that this does not involve directly our struggle with Mr. Khrushchev for survival. Mr. Khrushchev is in New York, and he maintains the Communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the Soviet Union itself. The Chinese Communists have always had a large population. But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country. The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom. If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if we\u2019re moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world. If we fail, then freedom fails. Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do? Are we as strong as we should be? Are we as strong as we must be if we\u2019re going to maintain our independence, and if we\u2019re going to maintain and hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to us for assistance, to those who look to us for survival? I should make it very clear that I do not think we\u2019re doing enough, that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we\u2019re making. This is a great country, but I think it could be a greater country; and this is a powerful country, but I think it could be a more powerful country. I\u2019m not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel-mill capacity unused. I\u2019m not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world. Because economic growth means strength and vitality; it means we\u2019re able to sustain our defenses; it means we\u2019re able to meet our commitments abroad. I\u2019m not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food \u2013 some of it rotting \u2013 even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual. I saw cases in West Virginia, here in the United States, where children took home part of their school lunch in order to feed their families because I don\u2019t think we\u2019re meeting our obligations toward these Americans. I\u2019m not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are. I\u2019m not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part-time shifts. I think we should have an educational system second to none. I\u2019m not satisfied when I see men like Jimmy Hoffa \u2013 in charge of the largest union in the United States \u2013 still free. I\u2019m not satisfied when we are failing to develop the natural resources of the United States to the fullest. Here in the United States, which developed the Tennessee Valley and which built the Grand Coulee and the other dams in the Northwest United States at the present rate of hydropower production \u2013 and that is the hallmark of an industrialized society \u2013 the Soviet Union by 1975 will be producing more power than we are. These are all the things, I think, in this country that can make our society strong, or can mean that it stands still. I\u2019m not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights. If a Negro baby is born \u2013 and this is true also of Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in some of our cities \u2013 he has about one-half as much chance to get through high school as a white baby. He has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student. He has about a third as much chance to be a professional man, about half as much chance to own a house. He has about uh \u2013 four times as much chance that he\u2019ll be out of work in his life as the white baby. I think we can do better. I don\u2019t want the talents of any American to go to waste. I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government. I don\u2019t at all. I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities. And I want the states to meet their responsibilities. But I think there is also a national responsibility. The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty-five years. The people of the United States individually could not have developed the Tennessee Valley; collectively they could have. A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so. Seventeen million Americans, who live over sixty-five on an average Social Security check of about seventy-eight dollars a month, they\u2019re not able to sustain themselves individually, but they can sustain themselves through the social security system. I don\u2019t believe in big government, but I believe in effective governmental action. And I think that\u2019s the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom. It\u2019s the only way that we\u2019re going to move ahead. I think we can do a better job. I think we\u2019re going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us. We cannot turn the job over to anyone else. If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails. And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country. The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States. Because they felt that the American society was moving again. I want us to recapture that image. I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how we\u2019re doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese Communists. That is the obligation upon our generation. In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt said in his inaugural that this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny. I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous. The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack \u2013 attack it has ever known? I think it can be. And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here. I think it\u2019s time America started moving again."}

That\u2019s untrue. The fa- the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twenty-five-cent loaf of bread. Even if you put his income up ten percent, that would be two and three-quarters percent three pers- or three cents out of that twenty-five cents. The t- man who grows tomatoes \u2013 it costs less for those tomatoes than it does for the label on the can. And I believe when the average hour for many farmers\u2019 wage is about fifty cents an hour, he should do better. But anybody who suggests that that program would c- come to any figure indicated by the Vice President is in error. The Vice President suggested a number of things. He suggested that we aid distressed areas. The Administration has vetoed that bill passed by the Congress twice. He suggested we pass an aid to education bill. But the Administration and the Republican majority in the Congress has opposed any realistic aid to education. And the Vice President cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers\u2019 salaries in the Senate, which prevented that being added. This Administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth \u2013 which means jobs \u2013 of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959. And when we have to find twenty-five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years, we\u2019re going to have to grow more. Governor Rockefeller says five per cent. The Democratic platform and others say five per cent. Many say four and a half per cent. The last eight years the average growth has been about two and a half per cent.

Uh \u2013 I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh \u2013 pay teachers\u2019 salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers\u2019 salaries \u2013 at least that\u2019s the way I read his remarks. Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers\u2019 salaries? Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then? Why do I take it now? We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers\u2019 salaries. We need higher teachers\u2019 salaries. But we also want our education to be free of federal control. When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach. I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession. There is another point that should be made. I favor higher salaries for teachers. But, as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference, the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction, which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers\u2019 salaries. I should also point out this; once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers\u2019 salaries, your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should. I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility. Teachers\u2019 salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries. This is not enough; it should be more. But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program. My objection here is not the cost in dollars. My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have."}

Uh I call that the people amendment. I think if you really believe that the people of a state ought to make a decision on a matter of this kind that uh \u2013 we ought to have a federal constitutional amendment that would permit each one of the fifty states to make the choice. Uh \u2013 I think this is a responsible and a proper way to proceed.

It\u2019s long overdue time to raise the minimum wage. And, America, this is one of those issues that separates the president and myself. We have fought to try to raise the minimum wage in the last years. But the Republican leadership of the House and Senate won\u2019t even let us have a vote on it. We\u2019re not allowed to vote on it. They don\u2019t want to raise the minimum wage. The minimum wage is the lowest minimum wage value it has been in our nation in 50 years. If we raise the minimum wage, which I will do over several years to $7 an hour, 9. 2 million women who are trying to raise their families would earn another $3,800 a year. The president has denied 9. 2 million women $3,800 a year, but he doesn\u2019t hesitate to fight for $136,000 to a millionaire. One percent of America got $89 billion last year in a tax cut, but people working hard, playing by the rules, trying to take care of their kids, family values, that we\u2019re supposed to value so much in America \u2014 I\u2019m tired of politicians who talk about family values and don\u2019t value families. What we need to do is raise the minimum wage. We also need to hold on to equal pay. Women work for 76 cents on the dollar for the same work that men do. That\u2019s not right in America. And we had an initiative that we were working on to raise women\u2019s pay. They\u2019ve cut it off. They\u2019ve stopped it. They don\u2019t enforce these kinds of things. Now, I think that it\u2019s a matter of fundamental right that if we raise the minimum wage, 15 million Americans would be positively affected. We\u2019d put money into the hands of people who work hard, who obey the rules, who play for the American dream. And if we did that, we\u2019d have more consumption ability in America, which is what we need right now in order to kick our economy into gear. I will fight tooth and nail to pass the minimum wage."}

We favor enterprise zones to give \u2013 and it\u2019s been blocked by Tip O\u2019Neill and that House of Representatives, those liberals in that House blocked a new idea to bring jobs into the black communities across the country. And because it\u2019s not an old handout, special federal spending program, it\u2019s blocked there \u2013 a good idea. And I\u2019d like to sec that tried. We\u2019ve brought more civil rights cases in the Justice Department than the previous administration by far. We believe in trying something new to help these black teenage kids; the minimum wage differential that says, \u201cLook,\u201d to an employer, \u201chire these guys. And, yes, they\u2019re willing to work for slightly less than the minimum wage.

Wonderful new legislation that\u2019s helping blacks more and more. We think of civil rights as something like crime in your neighborhoods. And, for example, when crime figures are going in the right direction that\u2019s good, that\u2019s a civil right. Similarly, we think of it in terms of quality of life, and that means interest rates. You know, it\u2019s funny, Mr. Mondale talks about real interest rates. The real interest rate is what you pay when you go down and try to buy a TV set or buy a car, or do whatever it is. The interest rates when we left office were 21% percent. Inflation! Is it a civil right to have the going right off the chart so you\u2019re busting every American family, those who can afford it the least? No, we\u2019ve got a good record.

But to try, as occurred in the case that you mentioned \u2013 that specific case \u2013 to try to tell the parishioners of any church, of any denomination, how they should vote, or for whom they should vote, I think violates the principle of separation of church and state. Now, Governor Reagan is running on a platform that calls for a Constitutional amendment banning abortion. I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual. And for the state to interfere with a Constitutional amendment, and tell a woman that she must carry that pregnancy to term, regardless of her personal belief, that, I think, violates freedom of conscience as much as anything that I can think of. And he is also running on a platform that suggests a litmus test for the selection of judges \u2013 that only judges that hold a certain, quote, \u201cview,\u201d on the sanctity of family life, ought to be appointed to the Federal Judiciary, one of the three great independent branches of our Government. No. I believe in freedom of choice. I don\u2019t believe in Constitutional Amendments that would interfere with that. I don\u2019t believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the Federal Judiciary. On the Amendment that you mentioned, I abandoned it 15 years ago.

The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall. There are hundreds of thousands of them. They really don\u2019t \u2013 they\u2019re not able to control their market very well. They bring their crops in or their livestock in, many of them about the same time. They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs \u2013 a few large companies in many cases \u2013 and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place. I think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture. And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse. The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States. The automobile industry is the number one market for steel. So if the farmers\u2019 economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country. So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one. Secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance. The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh \u2013 surpluses \u2013 nine billion dollars worth. We\u2019ve had a uh \u2013 higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years. I think that this farm policy has failed. In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance. And that can only be done through governmental action. I therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported, that the federal government, after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity, attempt to bring supply and demand into balance \u2013 attempt effective production controls \u2013 so that we won\u2019t have that five or six per cent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent. I think Mr. Benson\u2019s program has failed. And I must say, after reading the Vice President\u2019s speech before the farmers, as he read mine, I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s very much different from Mr. Benson\u2019s. I don\u2019t think it provides effective governmental controls. I think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years, which was Mr. Benson\u2019s theory. I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future."}

You take the raw product you produce, I presume you\u2019re a farmer, off your farm, and you convert it. Value-added processing is important. I\u2019m for research and development. Spending research and development money so that we can use our technological base to figure out new uses for farm products. I\u2019m for getting rid of the death tax, completely getting rid of the death tax. One reason family farmers are forced to sell early is because of the death tax. This is a bad tax. The President shouldn\u2019t have vetoed that bill. It\u2019s a tax that taxes people twice. It penalizes the family farmer. So should I be fortunate enough to earn your vote, I also understand \u2014 I want to open up markets, but I also understand that farming is a part of our national security. I\u2019m from a big farm state. We\u2019re the second biggest state \u2014 farming state in the country. And I hear from my farmers and friends all the time. The Vice President is right, by the way. Every day is earth day if you own the land. I like the policies that will encourage farmers to put \u2014 set aside land as well for conservation purposes. Thank you."}

And let me step back and tell you what I would like to do with our immigration policy broadly and include an answer to your question. But first of all, this is a nation of immigrants. We welcome people coming to this country as immigrants. My dad was born in Mexico of American parents; Ann\u2019s dad was born in Wales and is a first-generation American. We welcome legal immigrants into this country. I want our legal system to work better. I want it to be streamlined. I want it to be clearer. I don\u2019t think you have to \u2014 shouldn\u2019t have to hire a lawyer to figure out how to get into this country legally. I also think that we should give visas to people \u2014 green cards, rather, to people who graduate with skills that we need. People around the world with accredited degrees in science and math get a green card stapled to their diploma, come to the U.S. of A. We should make sure our legal system works. Number two, we\u2019re going to have to stop illegal immigration. There are 4 million people who are waiting in line to get here legally. Those who\u2019ve come here illegally take their place. So I will not grant amnesty to those who have come here illegally. What I will do is I\u2019ll put in place an employment verification system and make sure that employers that hire people who have come here illegally are sanctioned for doing so. I won\u2019t put in place magnets for people coming here illegally. So for instance, I would not give driver\u2019s licenses to those that have come here illegally as the president would. The kids of those that came here illegally, those kids, I think, should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United States and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident. Now when the president ran for office, he said that he\u2019d put in place, in his first year, a piece of legislation \u2014 he\u2019d file a bill in his first year that would reform our \u2014 our immigration system, protect legal immigration, stop illegal immigration. He didn\u2019t do it. He had a Democrat House, a Democrat Senate, super majority in both Houses. Why did he fail to even promote legislation that would have provided an answer for those that want to come legally and for those that are here illegally today?

Governor Bush and I have emphasized while, while we are clearly both pro-life, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we believe. We want to reduce the incidence of abortion on our society. Many on the pro-choice side have said the same thing. Even Bill Clinton has advocated reducing abortion to make it as rare as possible. With respect to the question of RU-486, we believe that \u2014 of course, that it\u2019s recently been approved by the FDA. That really was a question of whether or not it was safe to be used by women. They didn\u2019t address the sort of the question of whether or not there should or should not be abortion in the society so much as evaluate that particular drug. What we would like to be able to do is to look for ways to reach across the divide between the two points of view and find things that we can do together to reduce the incidence of abortion. Such things as promoting adoption as an alternative. Encouraging parental notification. And we also think banning the horrific practice of partial birth abortions is an area where there could be agreement. Congress has twice passed by overwhelming margins, a significant number of votes from both parties, the ban on partial birth abortions. Twice it\u2019s been vetoed by Bill Clinton and Al Gore. We would hope eventually they would recognize that\u2019s not a good position for them to be in. With respect to the RU-486 proposal, at this stage I haven\u2019t looked in particular at that particular piece of legislation. Governor Bush made it clear the other night he did not anticipate that he would be able to go in and direct the FDA to reverse course on that particular issue, primarily because the decision they made was on the drug, not the question of whether or not it would support abortion."}

The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with. There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position. There is no question but that this nation cannot stand still; because we are in a deadly competition, a competition not only with the men in the Kremlin, but the men in Peking. We\u2019re ahead in this competition, as Senator Kennedy, I think, has implied. But when you\u2019re in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead. And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the United States should move ahead. Where, then, do we disagree? I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still. We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world. Now last year, of course, was 1958. That happened to be a recession year. But when we look at the growth of G.N.P. this year, a year of recovery, we find that it\u2019s six and nine-tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today. More about that later. Looking then to this problem of how the United States should move ahead and where the United States is moving, I think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner: Let\u2019s look at the record. Is the United States standing still? Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation? Is it true that, as far as this country is concerned, in the field of electric power, in all of the fields that he has mentioned, we have not been moving ahead. Well, we have a comparison that we can make. We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration. When we compare these two records in the areas that Senator Kennedy has \u2013 has discussed tonight, I think we find that America has been moving ahead. Let\u2019s take schools. We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years. Let\u2019s take hydroelectric power. We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history. Let us take hospitals. We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration. The same is true of highways. Let\u2019s put it in terms that all of us can understand. We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven years. That shows that there\u2019s been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor. But let\u2019s not put it there; let\u2019s put it in terms of the average family. What has happened to you? We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration. What about the prices you pay? We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration. What\u2019s the net result of this? This means that the average family income went up fifteen per cent in the Eisenhower years as against two per cent in the Truman years. Now, this is not standing still. But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isn\u2019t enough. A record is never something to stand on. It\u2019s something to build on. And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress. And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way. Senator Kennedy has suggested that he believes he knows the way. I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion. But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new. They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it. And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then. What kind of programs are we for? We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people. We are for programs, in addition, which will see that our medical care for the aged are \u2013 is \u2013 are much \u2013 is much better handled than it is at the present time. Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims. We both want to help the old people. We want to see that they do have adequate medical care. The question is the means. I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates. I could give better examples, but for \u2013 for whatever it is, whether it\u2019s in the field of housing, or health, or medical care, or schools, or the eh- development of electric power, we have programs which we believe will move America, move her forward and build on the wonderful record that we have made over these past seven and a half years. Now, when we look at these programs, might I suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much you\u2019re spending. I will concede that in all the areas to which I have referred Senator Kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than I would have it spend. I costed out the cost of the Democratic platform. It runs a minimum of thirteen and two-tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than we\u2019re presently spending. Now the Republican platform will cost more too. It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than we\u2019re presently spending. Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours? Not at all. Because it isn\u2019t a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn\u2019t a question of which government does the most. It is a question of which administration does the right thing. And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans. I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress. The final point that I would like to make is this: Senator Kennedy has suggested in his speeches that we lack compassion for the poor, for the old, and for others that are unfortunate. Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere. I know what it means to be poor. I know what it means to see people who are unemployed. I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals."}

But we also believe that gay and lesbians and gay and lesbian couples, those who have been in long-term relationships, deserve to be treated respectfully, they deserve to have benefits. For example, a gay couple now has a very difficult time, one, visiting the other when they\u2019re in the hospital, or, for example, if, heaven forbid, one of them were to pass away, they have trouble even arranging the funeral. I mean, those are not the kind of things that John Kerry and I believe in. I suspect the vice president himself does not believe in that. But we don\u2019t \u2014 we do believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman. And I want to go back, if I can, to the question you just asked, which is this constitutional amendment. I want to make sure people understand that the president is proposing a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage that is completely unnecessary. Under the law of this country for the last 200 years, no state has been required to recognize another state\u2019s marriage. Let me just be simple about this. My state of North Carolina would not be required to recognize a marriage from Massachusetts, which you just asked about. There is absolutely no purpose in the law and in reality for this amendment. It\u2019s nothing but a political tool. And it\u2019s being used in an effort to divide this country on an issue that we should not be dividing America on. We ought to be talking about issues like health care and jobs and what\u2019s happening in Iraq, not using an issue to divide this country in a way that\u2019s solely for political purposes.

I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future for rural communities and for rural America and at the same time working on Third World debt. As a matter of fact, Mexico, itself, is one of our biggest agricultural customers, so in the sense that we can work to help Mexico rebuild and expand and deal with these very serious economic problems we help our farmers at the same time."}

The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done. The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 21\\1\/2\\-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier. All of these things are presently being rectified, and I think that we are going to salvage the farmers.

Now, the President spoke a moment ago about that I was against the minimum wage.

This country uh \u2013 changed drastically in 1969 when the uh \u2013 terms of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were over and Richard Nixon and \u2013 and Gerald Ford became the presidents. There was a time when there was hope for those who uh \u2013 were poor and downtrodden and who were \u2013 uh elderly or who were \u2013 uh ill or who were in minority groups, but that time has been gone. I think the greatest thing that ever happened to the South was the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the opening up of opportunities \u2013 uh to black people \u2013 the chance to vote, to hold a job, to buy a house, to go to school, and to participate in public affairs.

On that question the Vice President and I disagreed.

Secondly, there have been statements made that uh \u2013 the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget.

Do you want a \u201cyou\u2019re hired\u201d president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d president in Donald Trump? I think that\u2019s not such a hard choice. Hillary and I have a plan that\u2019s on the table that\u2019s a \u201cyou\u2019re hired\u201d plan. Five components. First thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow. Second thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year. Third, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you can\u2019t work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work. Fourth, we promote small business growth, just as we\u2019ve done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses. Hillary and I each grew up in small-business families. My dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight. And, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top who\u2019ve benefited as we\u2019ve come out of recession to pay more. The Trump plan is a different plan. It\u2019s a \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d plan. And there\u2019s two key elements to it. First, Donald Trump said wages are too high. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage. Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15. And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana. The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump. The problem with this, Elaine, is that\u2019s exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession \u2014 the deepest recession since the 1930s. Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs. The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs. And Donald Trump \u2014 why would he do this? Because his tax plan basically helps him. And if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan."}

But I run because I believe this year the United States has a great opportunity to make a move forward, to make a determination here at home and around the world, that it\u2019s going to reestablish itself as a vigorous society. My judgment is that the Republican party has stood still here in the United States, and it\u2019s also stood still around the world. Uh \u2013 We\u2019re using about fifty percent of our steel capacity today. We had a recession in fifty-eight. We had a recession in fifty-four. We\u2019re not moving ahead in education the way we should. We didn\u2019t make a judgment in fifty-seven and fifty-six and fifty-five and fifty-four that outer space would be important. If we stand still here, if we appoint people to ambassadorships and positions in Washington who have a status quo outlook, who don\u2019t recognize that this is a revolutionary time, then the United States does not maintain its influence. And if we fail, the cause of freedom fails. I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again, to get our economy moving ahead, to set before the American people its goals, its unfinished business. And then throughout the world appoint the best people we can get, ambassadors who can speak the language \u2013 no mere \u2013 not merely people who made a political contribution but who can speak the language. Bring students here; let them see what kind of a country we have. Mr. Nixon said that we should not regard them as pawns in the cold war; we should identify ourselves with them. If that were true, why didn\u2019t we identify ourselves with the people of Africa? Why didn\u2019t we bring students over here? Why did we suddenly offer Congo three hundred students last June when they had the tremendous revolt? That was more than we had offered to all of Africa before from the federal government. I believe that this party \u2013 Republican party \u2013 has stood still really for twenty-five years \u2013 its leadership has. It opposed all of the programs of President Roosevelt and others \u2013 the minimum wage and for housing and economic growth and development of our natural resources, the Tennessee Valley and all the rest. And I believe that if we can get a party which believes in movement, which believes in going ahead, then we can reestablish our position in the world \u2013 strong defense, strong in economic growth, justice for our people, co- guarantee of constitutional rights, so that people will believe that we practice what we preach, and then around the world, particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which existed in Latin America at the time of Franklin Roosevelt. He was a good neighbor in Latin America because he was a good neighbor in the United States; because they saw us as a society that was compassionate, that cared about people, that was moving this country ahead. I believe it my responsibility as the leader of the Democratic party in 1960 to try to warn the American people that in this crucial time we can no longer afford to stand still. We can no longer afford to be second best. I want people all over the world to look to the United States again, to feel that we\u2019re on the move, to feel that our high noon is in the future. I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States, and that they\u2019re going to put this country back to work again. I don\u2019t believe that there is anything this country cannot do. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any burden, or any responsibility, that any American would not assume to protect his country, to protect our security, to advance the cause of freedom. And I believe it incumbent upon us now to do that. Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that that generation of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny. I believe in 1960 and sixty-one and two and three we have a rendezvous with destiny. And I believe it incumbent upon us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom; and to do that, we must give this country leadership and we must get America moving again."}

Our faith informs us in everything we do. My faith informs me about how to take care of the vulnerable, of how to make sure that people have a chance in life. Now, you want to ask basically why I\u2019m pro-life? It\u2019s not simply because of my Catholic faith. That\u2019s a factor, of course. But it\u2019s also because of reason and science. You know, I think about 10 1\/2 years ago, my wife Janna and I went to Mercy Hospital in Janesville where I was born, for our seven week ultrasound for our firstborn child, and we saw that heartbeat. A little baby was in the shape of a bean. And to this day, we have nicknamed our firstborn child Liza, \u201cBean.\u201d Now I believe that life begins at conception. That\u2019s why \u2014 those are the reasons why I\u2019m pro-life. Now I understand this is a difficult issue, and I respect people who don\u2019t agree with me on this, but the policy of a Romney administration will be to oppose abortions with the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. What troubles me more is how this administration has handled all of these issues. Look at what they\u2019re doing through Obamacare with respect to assaulting the religious liberties of this country. They\u2019re infringing upon our first freedom, the freedom of religion, by infringing on Catholic charities, Catholic churches, Catholic hospitals. Our church should not have to sue our federal government to maintain their religious liberties. And with respect to abortion, the Democratic Party used to say they wanted it to be safe, legal and rare. Now they support it without restriction and with taxpayer funding. Taxpayer funding in Obamacare, taxpayer funding with foreign aid. The vice president himself went to China and said that he sympathized and wouldn\u2019t second guess their one child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations. That to me is pretty extreme."}

If it sounds incredible that I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant, that\u2019s because it\u2019s not true. The \u2014 here are the facts. There was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade. The fact is that there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it. And the Illinois Medical Society, the organization of doctors in Illinois, voted against it. Their Hippocratic Oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books. With respect to partial-birth abortion, I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there\u2019s an exception for the mother\u2019s health and life, and this did not contain that exception. And I attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional. And that was rejected, and that\u2019s why I voted present, because I\u2019m willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception. The last point I want to make on the issue of abortion. This is an issue that \u2014 look, it divides us. And in some ways, it may be difficult to \u2014 to reconcile the two views. But there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, \u201cWe should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby.\u201d Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for the first time this year, and I think that\u2019s where we can find some common ground, because nobody\u2019s pro-abortion. I think it\u2019s always a tragic situation. We should try to reduce these circumstances."}

First of all, I cannot tell you how deeply I respect the belief about life and when it begins. I\u2019m a Catholic, raised a Catholic. I was an altar boy. Religion has been a huge part of my life. It helped lead me through a war, leads me today. But I can\u2019t take what is an article of faith for me and legislate it for someone who doesn\u2019t share that article of faith, whether they be agnostic, atheist, Jew, Protestant, whatever. I can\u2019t do that. But I can counsel people. I can talk reasonably about life and about responsibility. I can talk to people, as my wife Teresa does, about making other choices, and about abstinence, and about all these other things that we ought to do as a responsible society. But as a president, I have to represent all the people in the nation. And I have to make that judgment. Now, I believe that you can take that position and not be pro- abortion, but you have to afford people their constitutional rights. And that means being smart about allowing people to be fully educated, to know what their options are in life, and making certain that you don\u2019t deny a poor person the right to be able to have whatever the constitution affords them if they can\u2019t afford it otherwise. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s important. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s important for the United States, for instance, not to have this rigid ideological restriction on helping families around the world to be able to make a smart decision about family planning. You\u2019ll help prevent AIDS. You\u2019ll help prevent unwanted children, unwanted pregnancies. You\u2019ll actually do a better job, I think, of passing on the moral responsibility that is expressed in your question. And I truly respect it."}

It is unAmerican, and to think that in the 21st Century this kind of nonsense is still going on. We have to stop it. The only way to stop it is through the law. The law, after all, is meant to express our values and our aspirations for our society. And our values are violently contradicted by the kind of racial profiling that I know exists.

So gun laws are important, no question about it, but so is loving children, and character education classes, and faith-based programs being a part of after-school programs.

I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be allowed to protect themselves and their families. I believe that we ought to keep guns out of the hands of people that shouldn\u2019t have them. That\u2019s why I\u2019m for instant background checks at gun shows, I\u2019m for trigger locks, I think that makes sense. Matter of fact, we distributed free trigger locks in the State of Texas so that people can get them and put them on their guns to make their guns more safe. I think we ought to raise the age at which juveniles can have a gun. But I also believe strongly that we need to enforce laws on the books that the best way to make sure that we keep our society safe and secure is to hold people accountable for breaking the law. If we catch somebody illegally selling a gun, there needs to be a consequence. If we keep somebody \u2014 you know, illegally using a gun, there needs to be a consequence. Enforcement of law, and the federal government can help. There is a great program called Project Exile in Richmond, Virginia, where we focused federal taxpayers\u2019 money and federal prosecutors and went after people who were illegally using guns. To me that\u2019s how you make society the safest it can be. And so, yeah, sometimes I agree with some of these groups in Washington and sometimes I don\u2019t. I\u2019m a pretty independent thinker.

Now, many here who are not involved in farming don\u2019t \u2014 won\u2019t follow this, so just forgive me. Because the 2% of the country that is involved in farming is important because the rest of us wouldn\u2019t eat except for them.

And I think that you pointed the way in your comments, because when you say there are multiple things accomplished by farmers, you\u2019re specifically including conservation and protection of the environment. And yes, farmers are the first environmentalists. And when they decide not to plow a field that is vulnerable to soil erosion, that may cost them a little money, but it helps the environment. I think that we ought to have an expanded conservation reserve program. And I think that the environmental benefits that come from sound management of the land ought to represent a new way for farmers to get some income that will enable them \u2014 enable you to make sensible choices in crop rotation, and when you leave the land fallow and the rest. Now, I\u2019ll go beyond that and say I think we need much more focus on rural economic development programs. I see a time when the Internet-based activities are more available in the rural areas and where the extra source of income that farm families used to have from shoe factories is replaced by an extra source of income from working in the information economy.

I think it\u2019s fitting that we\u2019re on the campus of a university tonight. These young people, when they get out of this wonderful university, will have difficulty finding a job. We\u2019ve got to clean this mess up, leave this country in good shape, and pass on the American dream to them. We\u2019ve got to collect the taxes to do it. If there\u2019s a fairer way, I\u2019m all ears (laughter) \u2013aah. (Laughter and applause) But\u2013but\u2013see, let me make it very clear. If people don\u2019t have the stomach to fix these problems, I think it\u2019s a good time to face it, November. If they do, then they will have heard the harsh reality of what we have to do. I\u2019m not playing Lawrence Welk music tonight."}

The Oregon plan made some good sense, but it\u2019s easy to dismiss the concerns of the disabled. As president I have to be sure that those waivers, which we\u2019re approving all over the place, are covered under the law. Maybe we can work it out. But the Americans with Disabilities Act, speaking about sound and sensible civil rights legislation, was the most foremost piece of legislation passed in modern times, and so we do have something more than a technical problem. Governor Clinton clicked off the things \u2014 he\u2019s going to take on insurance companies and bureaucracies. He failed to take on somebody else \u2014 the malpractice suit people, those that bring these lawsuits against \u2014 these frivolous trial lawyers\u2019 lawsuits that are running the costs of medical care up 25 to 50 billion. And he refuses to put anything, controls, on these crazy lawsuits. If you want to help somebody, don\u2019t run the costs up by making doctors have to have 5 or 6 tests where one would do for fear of being sued, or have somebody along the highway not stop to pick up a guy and help him because he\u2019s afraid a trial lawyer will come along and sue him. We\u2019re suing each other too much and caring for each other too little."}

I hope you talked to them about the fact that you were going to increase spending to $220 billion. I\u2019m sure what you didn\u2019t talk to them about was about how we\u2019re going to reform the health care system, like the president wants to do. He wants to go out and to reform the health care system so that every American will have available to them affordable health insurance. I\u2019m sure one other thing that you didn\u2019t talk to them about, Senator, and that is legal reform, because your position on legal reform is the status quo. And yet you talk about foreign competition. Why should an American company have to spend 15 to 20 times on product liability and insurance costs compared to a company in Japan or a company in Germany or somewhere else? That\u2019s not right. We have product liability reform legislation on Capitol Hill. It will create jobs. And a Democratic Congress won\u2019t pass it."}

If they just want to keep slow dancing and talk about it and not do it, I\u2019m not your man. I am results oriented. I am action oriented. I\u2019ve dealt my businesses. Getting things done in three months that my competitors took 18 months to do. Everybody says you can\u2019t do that with Congress. Sure, you can do that with Congress. Congress \u2014 they\u2019re all good people. They\u2019re all patriots but you\u2019ve got to link arms and work with them. Sure, you\u2019ll have arguments. Sure, you\u2019ll have fights. We have them all day every day. But we get the job done. Now, I have to come back in my clothes to one thing because I am passionate about education. I was talking about early childhood education for disadvantaged little children. And let me tell you one specific pilot program where children who don\u2019t have a chance go to this program when they\u2019re 3. Now we\u2019re going back to when the mother\u2019s pregnant and they\u2019ll start right after they\u2019re born. Starting when they\u2019re 3 and going to this school until they\u2019re 9 and then going into the public school in the 4th grade. Ninety percent are on the honor role. Now that will change America. Those children will all go to college. They will live the American dream. And I beg the American people, any time they think about reforming education to take this piece of society that doesn\u2019t have a chance and take these little pieces of clay that can be shaped and molded and give them the same love and nurture and affection and support you give your children and teach them that they\u2019re unique and that they\u2019re precious and that there\u2019s only one person in the world like them and you will see this nation bloom. And we will have so many people who are qualified for the top job that it will be terrific. Now, finally, if you can\u2019t pay the bills you\u2019re dead in the water. And we have got to put our nation back to work. Now, if you don\u2019t want to really do that I\u2019m not your man. I\u2019d go crazy sitting up there slow dancing that one. In other words, unless we\u2019re going to do it, then pick somebody who likes to talk about it. Now, just remember when you think about me \u2014 I didn\u2019t create this mess. I\u2019ve been paying taxes just like you and Lord knows, I\u2019ve paid my share \u2014 over a billion in taxes. And for a guy that started out with everything he owned in the trunk of his car \u2014"}

I\u2019d like to see a balanced budget amendment for America, to protect the American taxpayers, and then that would discipline not only the executive branch but the spending Congress, the Congress that\u2019s been in control of one party, his party, for 38 years. And we almost had it done. And that institution, the House of Representatives \u2014 everyone is yelling \u201cClean House!\u201d One of the reasons is we almost had it done, and the speaker \u2014 a very, able, decent fellow, I might add \u2014 but he twisted the arms of some of the sponsors of that legislation and had them change their vote. What\u2019s relevant here is that tool, that discipline, that he has to live by in Arkansas, and I\u2019d like it for the American people. I want the line-item veto. I want a check-off, so if the Congress can\u2019t do it, let people check off their income tax, 10% of it, to compel the government to cut spending. And if they can\u2019t do it, if the Congress can\u2019t do it, let them then have to do it across the board. That\u2019s what we call a sequester. That\u2019s the discipline we need, and I\u2019m working for that \u2014 to protect the American taxpayer against the big spenders."}

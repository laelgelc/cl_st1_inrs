I live in a state where over half the adults have hunting or fishing licenses, or both. But I believe we have to have some way of checking hand guns before they\u2019re sold, to check the criminal history, the mental health history, and the age of people who are buying them. Therefore I support the Brady bill which would impose a national waiting period unless and until a state did what only Virginia has done now, which is to automate its records. Once you automate your records, then you don\u2019t have to have a waiting period, but at least you can check. I also think we should have frankly restrictions on assault weapons whose only purpose is to kill. We need to give the police a fighting chance in our urban areas where the gangs are building up. The third thing I would say \u2014 it doesn\u2019t bear directly on gun control, but it\u2019s very important \u2014 we need more police on the street. There is a crime bill which would put more police on the street, which was killed for this session by a filibuster in the Senate, mostly be Republican senators, and I think it\u2019s a shame it didn\u2019t pass, I think it should be made the law \u2014 but it had the Brady bill in it, the waiting period. I also believe that we should offer college scholarships to people who will agree to work them off as police officers, and I think, as we reduce our military forces, we should let people earn military retirement by coming out and working as police officers. Thirty years ago there were three police officers on the street for every crime; today there are three crimes for every police officer. In the communities which have had real success putting police officers near schools where kids carry weapons, to get the weapons out of the schools, are on the same blocks, you\u2019ve seen crime go down. In Houston there\u2019s been a 15- percent drop in the crime rate in the last year because of the work the mayor did there in increasing the police force. So I know it can work; I\u2019ve seen it happen."}

But I\u2019ll tell you this. I\u2019m also a former law enforcement officer. I ran one of the largest district attorney\u2019s offices in America, one of the ten largest. I put people behind bars for the rest of their life. I\u2019ve broken up organized crime. I know something about prosecuting. And most of the law enforcement agencies in America wanted that assault weapons ban. They don\u2019t want to go into a drug bust and be facing an AK-47. I was hunting in Iowa last year with a sheriff from one of the counties there, and he pointed to a house in back of us, and said, \u201cSee the house over? We just did a drug bust a week earlier, and the guy we arrested had an AK-47 lying on the bed right beside him. \u201c Because of the president\u2019s decision today, law enforcement officers will walk into a place that will be more dangerous. Terrorists can now come into America and go to a gun show and, without even a background check, buy an assault weapon today. And that\u2019s what Osama bin Laden\u2019s handbook said, because we captured it in Afghanistan. It encouraged them to do it. So I believe America\u2019s less safe.

But I\u2019ve got a better idea. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve worked on for 15 years. It\u2019s called the automated check or the instant check. It\u2019s being used in 17 states right now. States like Florida, Colorado, Virginia, and other states. You don\u2019t buy any gun. You don\u2019t get any gun. We\u2019ve got 20 million names on a computer in Washington, D.C. of people who should not have guns. We ought to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. And, there are eight other categories that should not have guns. I\u2019ve been working on this for a long, long time. You walk in, you put your little card in there. If it says tilt, you don\u2019t get any gun. You don\u2019t get a hand gun, you don\u2019t get a rifle, you don\u2019t get a shot gun, you get zippo. If we\u2019re going to protect American children and American families and people who live as prisoners in their own home, we\u2019ve got to stop guns from being dumped on the street. The administration says they support the instant check. They\u2019ve appropriated about $200 million, but only spent about $3 million to get it underway. In our administration, in my administration, we will expedite. This keeps up with technology. It keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have guns. That is the bottom line. And I believe it\u2019s a good idea, has strong bipartisan support. And perhaps that\u2019s another thing we can depoliticize. You talk about the Brady Bill. There has only been one prosecution under the Brady \u2014 only one under the assault weapon ban and only seven under the Brady Bill that you talk about all the time. And on the assault weapon ban, out of 17 weapons that were banned, only six banned now because eleven have been modified and are back on the street. Let\u2019s get together on this instant check because that will really make a difference."}

I think we put a lot on police shoulders. And this is something I got a lot of scar tissue and experience on. I was a city councilman and mayor in Richmond. And when I came in, we had one of the highest homicide rates in the United States. We fought very, very hard over the course of my time in local office with our police department, and we reduced our homicide rate nearly in half. And then when I was governor of Virginia, we worked hard, too. And we did something we had really wanted to do. For the first time ever, we cracked the top 10, 10 safest states, because we worked together. Here\u2019s what I learned as a mayor and a governor. The way you make communities safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing. You build the bonds between the community and the police force, build bonds of understanding, and then when people feel comfortable in their communities, that gap between the police and the communities they serve narrows. And when that gap narrows, it\u2019s safer for the communities and it\u2019s safer for the police. That model still works across our country, but there are some other models that don\u2019t work, an overly aggressive, more militarized model. Donald Trump recently said we need to do more stop-and-frisk around the country. That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community. So here\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. We\u2019ll focus on community policing. We will focus on \u2014 and Hillary Clinton has rolled out a really comprehensive mental health reform package that she worked on with law enforcement professionals, and we will also fight the scourge of gun violence in the United States. I\u2019m a gun-owner. I\u2019m a strong Second Amendment supporter. But I\u2019ve got a lot of scar tissue, because when I was governor of Virginia, there was a horrible shooting at Virginia Tech, and we learned that through that painful situation that gaps in the background record check system should have been closed and it could have prevented that crime, and so we\u2019re going to work to do things like close background record checks. And if we do, we won\u2019t have the tragedies that we did. One of those killed at Virginia Tech was a guy named Liviu Librescu. He was a 70-plus-year-old Romanian Holocaust survivor. He had survived the Holocaust. Then he survived the Soviet Union takeover of his country. But then he was a visiting professor at Virginia Tech, and he couldn\u2019t survive the scourge of gun violence. We can support the Second Amendment and do things like background record checks and make us safer, and that will make police safer, too."}

I am. But let\u2019s look at the overall record. Overall in America cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years, casual drug use down 13 percent. The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it. Let me tell you what I tried to do about it. I appointed a four-star general who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country as our nation\u2019s drug czar. The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired. We submitted the biggest drug budget ever. We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border. We supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including, including the death penalty for drug kingpins. And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug-free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all those things were very important. Do I think that I bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still don\u2019t understand drugs are wrong, drugs can kill you. Even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them. I think we all do. And I hope we can do better. I don\u2019t think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I don\u2019t think Senator Dole supports using using drugs. I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn\u2019t dangerous and won\u2019t kill them and won\u2019t destroy their lives, get the message and change."}

The record just doesn\u2019t prove that such legislation or action by a local city council is effective. What we have to do, and this is the crux of the matter, is to make it very, very uh \u2013 difficult for a person who uses a gun in the commission of a crime to stay out of jail. If we make the use of a gun in the commission. of a crime a serious criminal offense, and that person is prosecuted, then, in my opinion, we are going after the person who uses the gun for the wrong reason. I don\u2019t believe in the registration of handguns or the registration of the handgun owner. That has not proven to be effective, and therefore, I think the better way is to go after the criminal, the individual who commits a crime in the possession of a gun and uses that gun for a part of his criminal activity. Those are the people who ought to be in jail. And the only way to do it is to pass strong legislation so that once apprehended, indicted, convicted, they\u2019ll be in jail and off the streets and not using guns in the commission of a crime."}

When you say loud and clear to somebody if you\u2019re going to carry a gun illegally, we\u2019re going to arrest you. If you\u2019re going to sell a gun illegally, you need to be arrested. If you commit a crime with a gun, there needs to be absolute certainty in the law. And that means that the local law enforcement officials need help at the federal level. Programs like Project Exile where the federal government intensifies arresting people who illegally use guns. And we haven\u2019t done a very good job of that at the federal level recently. And I\u2019m going to make it a priority. Secondly, I don\u2019t think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldn\u2019t have them. That\u2019s why I support instant background checks at gun shows. One of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not. In Texas I tried to do something innovative. There\u2019s a lot of talk about trigger locks being on guns sold in the future. I support that. But I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come and get one for free. So we\u2019re distributing in our State of Texas for free. I think we ought to raise the age at which a juvenile can carry a handgun from 18 to 21. I disagree with the vice president on this issue. He is for registration of guns. I think the only people that are going to show up to register or get a license \u2014 I guess licensing like a driver\u2019s license for a gun, the only people that are going to show up are law-abiding citizens. The criminal is not going to show up and say hey, give me my I.D. card. It\u2019s the law-abiding citizens who will do that. An I don\u2019t think that is going to be an effective tool to make the \u2014 keep our society safe."}

Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they\u2019re treated in the criminal justice system. We\u2019ve just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte. And we\u2019ve got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police. We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they\u2019re well prepared to use force only when necessary. Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law. Right now, that\u2019s not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods. So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform. I\u2019ve laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system. But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform. So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. And we\u2019ve got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together. So we have to do two things, as I said. We have to restore trust. We have to work with the police. We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them. And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we\u2019re seeing today."}

We\u2019ve got a long tradition of hunting and sportsmen and people who want to make sure they can protect themselves. But there have been too many instances during the course of my presidency, where I\u2019ve had to comfort families who have lost somebody. Most recently out in Aurora. You know, just a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably about a month, I saw a mother, who I had met at the bedside of her son, who had been shot in that theater. And her son had been shot through the head. And we spent some time, and we said a prayer and, remarkably, about two months later, this young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable, good as new. But there were a lot of families who didn\u2019t have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands didn\u2019t survive. So my belief is that, (A), we have to enforce the laws we\u2019ve already got, make sure that we\u2019re keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill. We\u2019ve done a much better job in terms of background checks, but we\u2019ve got more to do when it comes to enforcement. But I also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters don\u2019t belong on our streets. And so what I\u2019m trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally. Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced. But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence. Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there\u2019s an awful lot of violence and they\u2019re not using AK-47s. They\u2019re using cheap hand guns. And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that our schools are working; that if there\u2019s violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control. And so what I want is a \u2014 is a comprehensive strategy. Part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. But part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur."}

There\u2019s a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up. But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe. There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective. Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective. It did not do what it needed to do. Now, I believe in community policing. And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991. Property crime is down 40 percent. We just don\u2019t want to see it creep back up. We\u2019ve had 25 years of very good cooperation. But there were some problems, some unintended consequences. Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses. And it\u2019s just a fact that if you\u2019re a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated. So we\u2019ve got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. We cannot just say law and order. We have to say\u2014we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little. We need to have more second chance programs. I\u2019m glad that we\u2019re ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system. You shouldn\u2019t have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans. So there are some positive ways we can work on this. And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us. Right now\u2014and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby\u2014right now, we\u2019ve got too many military-style weapons on the streets. In a lot of places, our police are outgunned. We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm. And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who\u2019s on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country. If you\u2019re too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way."}

And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive. We have seen premature births that are now grown-up, happy people going around. Also, there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life. In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor \u2014 signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder. Now, isn\u2019t it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child, and it was abortion and not murder, but if somebody else does it, that\u2019s murder?

My three brothers and I would marvel at my uncle when he would come out in his uniform, sidearm at his side. Police officers are the best of us. And the men and women, white, African-American, Asian, Latino, Hispanic, they put their lives on the line every single day. And let me say, at the risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea. It\u2019s worked in the Hoosier state. And we fully support that. Donald Trump and I are going to make sure that law enforcement have the resources and the tools to be able to really restore law and order to the cities and communities in this nation. It\u2019s probably \u2014 probably why the 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States of America, because they see his commitment to them. They see his commitment to law and order. But they also \u2014 they also hear the bad mouthing, the bad mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings as \u2014 as a reason to \u2014 to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of \u2014 of implicit bias or institutional racism. And that really has got to stop. I mean, when an African-American police officer in Charlotte named Brentley Vinson, an all-star football player who went to Liberty University here in the state, came home, followed his dad into law enforcement, joined the force in Charlotte, joined the force in Charlotte in 2014, was involved in a police action shooting that claimed the life of Keith \u2014 Keith Lamont Scott, it was a tragedy. I mean, I \u2014 we \u2014 we mourn with those who mourn. We \u2014 we grieve with those who grieve. And we\u2019re saddened at the loss of life. But Hillary Clinton actually referred to that moment as an example of implicit bias in the police force, where \u2014 where she used \u2014 when she was asked in the debate a week ago whether there was implicit bias in law enforcement, her only answer was that there\u2019s implicit bias in everyone in the United States.

Our faith informs us in everything we do. My faith informs me about how to take care of the vulnerable, of how to make sure that people have a chance in life. Now, you want to ask basically why I\u2019m pro-life? It\u2019s not simply because of my Catholic faith. That\u2019s a factor, of course. But it\u2019s also because of reason and science. You know, I think about 10 1\/2 years ago, my wife Janna and I went to Mercy Hospital in Janesville where I was born, for our seven week ultrasound for our firstborn child, and we saw that heartbeat. A little baby was in the shape of a bean. And to this day, we have nicknamed our firstborn child Liza, \u201cBean.\u201d Now I believe that life begins at conception. That\u2019s why \u2014 those are the reasons why I\u2019m pro-life. Now I understand this is a difficult issue, and I respect people who don\u2019t agree with me on this, but the policy of a Romney administration will be to oppose abortions with the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. What troubles me more is how this administration has handled all of these issues. Look at what they\u2019re doing through Obamacare with respect to assaulting the religious liberties of this country. They\u2019re infringing upon our first freedom, the freedom of religion, by infringing on Catholic charities, Catholic churches, Catholic hospitals. Our church should not have to sue our federal government to maintain their religious liberties. And with respect to abortion, the Democratic Party used to say they wanted it to be safe, legal and rare. Now they support it without restriction and with taxpayer funding. Taxpayer funding in Obamacare, taxpayer funding with foreign aid. The vice president himself went to China and said that he sympathized and wouldn\u2019t second guess their one child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations. That to me is pretty extreme."}

I want to thank President Reagan for agreeing to debate. He didn\u2019t have to, and he did, and we all appreciate it. The President\u2019s favorite question is: Are you better off? Well, if you\u2019re wealthy, you\u2019re better off. If you\u2019re middle income, you\u2019re about where you were. And if you\u2019re modest income, you\u2019re worse off. That\u2019s what the economists tell us. But is that really the question that should be asked? Isn\u2019t the real question is will we be better off? Will our children be better off? Are we building the future that this nation needs? I believe that if we ask those questions that bear on our future, not just congratulate ourselves but challenge us to solve those problems, you\u2019ll see that we need new leadership. Are we better of with this arms race? Will we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens? Are we better off when we deemphasize our values in human rights? Are we better off when we load our children with this fantastic debt? Would fathers and mothers feel proud of themselves if they loaded their children with debts like this nation is now \u2014 over a trillion dollars on the shoulders of our children? Can we say, really say that we will be better off when we pull away from sort of that basic American instinct of decency and fairness? I would rather lose a campaign about decency than win a campaign about self-interest. I don\u2019t think this nation is composed of people who care only for themselves. And when we sought to assault Social Security and Medicare, as the record shows we did, I think that was mean-spirited. When we terminated 400,000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability \u2014 confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for 4 years, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what America is all about. America is a fair society, and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him. I believe there\u2019s fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system. I believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment. And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful. These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price. That\u2019s not fair for our future. I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training, because this world is more complex and we\u2019re being pressed harder all the time. I believe in opening doors. We won the Olympics, in part, because we\u2019ve had civil rights laws and the laws that prohibit discrimination against women. I have been for those efforts all my life. The President\u2019s record is quite different. The question is our future. President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, \u201cWe are great, but we can be greater.\u201d We can be better if we face our future, rejoice in our strengths, face our problems, and by solving them, build a better society for our children. Thank you."}

I talk about strengthening the American family and it\u2019s very hard to strengthen the family if people are scared to walk down to the corner store and, you know, send their kid down to get a loaf of bread. It\u2019s very hard. I have been fighting for very strong anti-crime legislation \u2014 habeas corpus reform, so you don\u2019t have these endless appeals, so when somebody gets sentenced, hey, this is for real. I\u2019ve been fighting for changes in the exclusionary rule so if an honest cop stops somebody and makes a technical mistake, the criminal doesn\u2019t go away. I\u2019ll probably get into a fight in this room with some but I happen to think that we need stronger death penalties for those that kill police officers. Virginia\u2019s in the lead in this, as Governor Clinton properly said, on this identification system for firearms. I am not for national registration of firearms. Some of the states that have the toughest anti-gun laws have the highest levels of crime. I am for the right, as the governor says- -I\u2019m a sportsman and I don\u2019t think you ought to eliminate all kinds of weapons. But I was not for the bill that he was talking about because it was not tough enough on the criminal. I\u2019m very pleased that the Fraternal Order of Police in Little Rock, Arkansas endorsed me because I think they see I\u2019m trying to strengthen the anti-crime legislation. We\u2019ve got more money going out for local police than any previous administration. So we\u2019ve got to get it under control and there\u2019s one last point I\u2019d make. Drugs. We have got to win our national strategy against drugs, the fight against drugs. And we\u2019re making some progress, doing a little better on interdiction. We\u2019re not doing as well amongst the people that get to be habitual drug-users. The good news is, and I think it\u2019s true in Richmond, teenage use is down of cocaine, substantially, 60% in the last couple of years. So we\u2019re making progress but until we get that one done, we\u2019re not going to solve the neighborhood crime problem."}

I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and I\u2019m worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions. This is a very important topic and it\u2019s a very sensitive topic, because a lot of good people disagree on the issue. I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America. Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country. Life of the unborn. As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life. I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America. What I do believe is that we can find good, common ground on issues of parental consent or parental notification. I know we need to ban partial birth abortions. This is a place where my opponent and I have strong disagreement. I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America. This is an issue that will require a new attitude. We\u2019ve been battling over abortion for a long period of time. Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life. Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors to \u2014 to allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors. Surely we can work together to create a cultural life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbor\u2019s life with a gun will understand that that\u2019s not the way America is meant to be.

We are using our military assets in a prudent way to deal with interdiction, and we\u2019ve made some success in this area. Seventy tons of cocaine have been stopped. But, you know, when you look at the drug problem \u2013 and it is a tremendous problem, and there are no easy solutions to it \u2013 it\u2019s a complicated problem, and it\u2019s heading up the effort to try to create a drug-free America, which is a challenge and a goal of all of us.

And education ought to begin at home, and it ought to be reinforced in our schools. And there\u2019s another thing that will be more important than the premise of this question on a hypothetical of using troops. We will use the military assets, we will use military assets \u2013 but we need to focus on another part of this problem, and that problem is law enforcement. And here is where we have a major disagreement with the governor of Massachusetts. He is opposed to the death penalty for drug kingpins. We believe people convicted of that crime deserve the death penalty, as does the legislation that\u2019s in the Congress that is supported by a bipartisan, including many Democrats of his party.

And it\u2019s one of the reasons why we have had the biggest drop in crime of any industrial state in America; why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in America. But we have work to do in this nation. We have work to do to fight a real war, not a phony war, against drugs. And that\u2019s something I want to lead, something we haven\u2019t had over the course of the past many years, even though the Vice President has been at least allegedly in charge of that war. We have much to do to step up that war, to double the number of drug enforcement agents, to fight both here and abroad, to work with our neighbors in this hemisphere. And I want to call a hemispheric summit just as soon after the 20th of January as possible to fight that war. But we also have to deal with drug education prevention here at home. And that\u2019s one of the things that I hope I can lead personally as the President of the United States. We\u2019ve had great success in my own state. And we\u2019ve reached out to young people and their families and been able to help them by beginning drug education and prevention in the early elementary grades. So we can fight this war, and we can win this war. And we can do so in a way that marshals our forces, that provides real support for state and local law enforcement officers who have not been getting that support, and do it in a way which will bring down violence in this nation, will help our youngsters to stay away from drugs, will stop this avalanche of drugs that\u2019s pouring into the country, and will make it possible for our kids and our families to grow up in safe and secure and decent neighborhoods."}

I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be allowed to protect themselves and their families. I believe that we ought to keep guns out of the hands of people that shouldn\u2019t have them. That\u2019s why I\u2019m for instant background checks at gun shows, I\u2019m for trigger locks, I think that makes sense. Matter of fact, we distributed free trigger locks in the State of Texas so that people can get them and put them on their guns to make their guns more safe. I think we ought to raise the age at which juveniles can have a gun. But I also believe strongly that we need to enforce laws on the books that the best way to make sure that we keep our society safe and secure is to hold people accountable for breaking the law. If we catch somebody illegally selling a gun, there needs to be a consequence. If we keep somebody \u2014 you know, illegally using a gun, there needs to be a consequence. Enforcement of law, and the federal government can help. There is a great program called Project Exile in Richmond, Virginia, where we focused federal taxpayers\u2019 money and federal prosecutors and went after people who were illegally using guns. To me that\u2019s how you make society the safest it can be. And so, yeah, sometimes I agree with some of these groups in Washington and sometimes I don\u2019t. I\u2019m a pretty independent thinker.

You can\u2019t carry a gun into a school. And there ought to be a consequence when you do carry a gun into a school. But Columbine spoke to a larger issue. It\u2019s really a matter of culture. It\u2019s a culture that somewhere along the line we\u2019ve begun to disrespect life. Where a child can walk in and have their heart turned dark as a result of being on the Internet and walk in and decide to take somebody else\u2019s life? So gun laws are important, no question about it, but so is loving children, and character education classes, and faith-based programs being a part of after-school programs. Some desperate child needs to have somebody put their arm around them and say, we love you. So there\u2019s a \u2014 this is a society that \u2014 of ours that\u2019s got to do a better job of teaching children right from wrong. And we can enforce law.

Love your neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself. And that\u2019s where our society must head if we\u2019re going to be a peaceful and prosperous society."}

It\u2019s an easy one. I\u2019m really fortunate. I grew up in a wonderful household with great Irish Catholic parents. My mom and dad are sitting right here. I was educated by Jesuits at Rockhurst High School in Kansas City. My 40th reunion is in 10 days. And I worked with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras, now nearly 35 years ago, and they were the heroes of my life. I try to practice my religion in a very devout way and follow the teachings of my church in my own personal life. But I don\u2019t believe in this nation, a First Amendment nation, where we don\u2019t raise any religion over the other, and we allow people to worship as they please, that the doctrines of any one religion should be mandated for everyone. For me, the hardest struggle in my faith life was the Catholic Church is against the death penalty and so am I. But I was governor of a state, and the state law said that there was a death penalty for crimes if the jury determined them to be heinous. And so I had to grapple with that. When I was running for governor, I was attacked pretty strongly because of my position on the death penalty. But I looked the voters of Virginia in the eye and said, look, this is my religion. I\u2019m not going to change my religious practice to get one vote, but I know how to take an oath and uphold the law. And if you elect me, I will uphold the law. And I was elected, and I did. It was very, very difficult to allow executions to go forward, but in circumstances where I didn\u2019t feel like there was a case for clemency, I told Virginia voters I would uphold the law, and I did. That was a real struggle. But I think it is really, really important that those of us who have deep faith lives don\u2019t feel like we could just substitute our own views for everybody else in society, regardless of their views."}

We need a hundred thousand more police on the street. I have a plan for that. Secondly, we ought to have treatment on demand. Thirdly, we ought to have boot camps for first-time nonviolent offenders so they can get discipline and treatment and education and get reconnected to the community before they\u2019re severed and sent to prison, where they can learn how to be first class criminals. There is a crime bill that, lamentably, was blocked from passage once again, mostly by Republicans in the US Senate, which would have addressed some of these problems.

I will not do anything to affect the rights of hunters or sportsmen. I think that homeowners have to be respected and their right to have a gun if they wish to. The problem I see is that there are too many guns getting into the hands of children, and criminals, and people who, for whatever reason, some kind of history of stalking or domestic abuse really should not be able to get guns. I think these assault weapons are a problem. So I favor closing the gun show loophole. In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to close it, but then the majority in the House of Representatives went the other way. That\u2019s still pending. If we could get agreement on that, maybe they could pass that in the final days of this Congress. I think we ought to restore the three-day waiting period under the Brady Law. I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively. Some of the restrictions that have been placed by the Congress in the last couple of years. I think \u2014 in the last few years I think have been unfortunate. I think that we ought to make all schools gun free. Have a gun-free zone around every school in this country. I think that measures like these are important.

I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole. There\u2019s other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment. You mentioned the Heller decision. And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them. And the court didn\u2019t accept that reasonable regulation, but they\u2019ve accepted many others. So I see no conflict between saving people\u2019s lives and defending the Second Amendment."}

I think of classroom teachers, classroom teachers that I have had, classroom teachers that youngsters have today who are real heroes to our young people. Because they inspire them. They teach them.

Drug counselors out there in the street who are providing help to youngsters who come up to me and others who ask for help and want help, are doing the hard work, the heroic work, which it takes to provide that kind of leadership, that kind of counseling, that kind of support.

They write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix. She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. He\u2019s 10 years old now. This is the only country he\u2019s ever known. And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected? You know, children listen to what is being said. To go back to the very, very first question. And there\u2019s a lot of fear\u2014in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect. Bullying is up. A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy. A lot of kids are expressing their concerns. So, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody."}

And Mr. Bush is right \u2013 the two go hand in hand. But if our government itself is doing business with people who we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking, if we don\u2019t understand that that sends out a very, very bad message to our young people, it\u2019s a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that I talked about and to young people like her all over the country, and say to them we want to help you. Now, I\u2019ve outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad, doubling the number of drug enforcement agents, having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together. But we also have to take demand seriously. You know, we have five percent of the world\u2019s population in this country. We\u2019re consuming 50 percent of the world\u2019s cocaine. And in my state I\u2019m proud to say we\u2019ve organized a drug education and prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for the country. We\u2019re helping youngsters; we\u2019re reaching out to them. And we\u2019re beginning with drug education and prevention beginning in the early elementary grades in every elementary school in our state, and that\u2019s the kind of effort we need in every elementary school in the United States of America. And we\u2019ve got to begin early, in the first, second and third grade, before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very, very dangerous substances. I guess the question I would ask of Mr. Bush is how we instill those values, how we create this environment for the drug free schools that we want in this country. If he or representatives of the administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy, or don\u2019t pursue that connection in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an example to our kids all over the country."}

Four years ago I ran for president at a time of high unemployment and rising frustration. I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community where everybody has a role to play. I wanted a government that was smaller and less bureaucratic to help people make the most of their own lives. Four years ago you took me on faith. Now there\u2019s a record: Ten and a half million more jobs, rising incomes, falling crime rates and welfare rolls, a strong America at peace. We are better off than we were four years ago. Let\u2019s keep it going. We cut the deficit by 60 percent. Now, let\u2019s balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans. Now let\u2019s pass the tax cuts for education and child rearing, help with medical emergencies, and buying a home. We passed family and medical leave. Now let\u2019s expand it so more people can succeed as parents and in the work force. We passed 100,000 police, the assault weapons ban, the Brady Bill. Now let\u2019s keep going by finishing the work of putting the police on the street and tackling juvenile gangs. We passed welfare reform. Now let\u2019s move a million people from welfare to work. And most important, let\u2019s make education our highest priority so that every eight-year-old will be able to read, every 12-year-old can log onto the Internet, every 18-year-old can go to college.

Now, it may very well be here in December you\u2019ll hear me say, I think there\u2019s a safe way to do it. There are other ways to make sure drugs are cheaper. One is to speed up generic drugs to the marketplace, quicker. Pharmaceuticals were using loopholes to keep brand \u2014 brand drugs in place, and generics are much less expensive than brand drugs. And we\u2019re doing just that. Another is to pass \u2014 to get our seniors to sign up to these drug discount cards, and they\u2019re working. Wanda Blackmore I met here from Missouri, the first time she bought drugs with her drug discount card, she paid $1.14, I think it was, for about $10 worth of drugs. These cards make sense.

We, of course, don\u2019t want to have automatic weapons, and that\u2019s already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons. What I believe is we have to do, as the president mentioned towards the end of his remarks there, which is to make enormous efforts to enforce the gun laws that we have, and to change the culture of violence that we have. And you ask how \u2014 how are we going to do that? And there are a number of things. He mentioned good schools. I totally agree. We were able to drive our schools to be number one in the nation in my state. And I believe if we do a better job in education, we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll give people the \u2014 the hope and opportunity they deserve and perhaps less violence from that. But let me mention another thing. And that is parents. We need moms and dads, helping to raise kids. Wherever possible the \u2014 the benefit of having two parents in the home, and that\u2019s not always possible. A lot of great single moms, single dads. But gosh to tell our kids that before they have babies, they ought to think about getting married to someone, that\u2019s a great idea. Because if there\u2019s a two parent family, the prospect of living in poverty goes down dramatically. The opportunities that the child will \u2014 will be able to achieve increase dramatically. So we can make changes in the way our culture works to help bring people away from violence and give them opportunity, and bring them in the American system. The \u2014 the greatest failure we\u2019ve had with regards to \u2014 to gun violence in some respects is what \u2014 what is known as Fast and Furious. Which was a program under this administration, and how it worked exactly I think we don\u2019t know precisely, where thousands of automatic, and AK-47 type weapons were \u2014 were given to people that ultimately gave them to \u2014 to drug lords. They used those weapons against \u2014 against their own citizens and killed Americans with them. And this was a \u2014 this was a program of the government. For what purpose it was put in place, I can\u2019t imagine. But it\u2019s one of the great tragedies related to violence in our society which has occurred during this administration. Which I think the American people would like to understand fully, it\u2019s been investigated to a degree, but \u2014 but the administration has carried out executive privilege to prevent all of the information from coming out. I\u2019d like to understand who it was that did this, what the idea was behind it, why it led to the violence, thousands of guns going to Mexican drug lords. OBAMA: Candy?"}

I don\u2019t want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country. We have 11 million undocumented people. They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people. He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation. Now, here\u2019s what that means. It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented. And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country. I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation. I think it\u2019s an idea that would rip our country apart. I have been for border security for years. I voted for border security in the United States Senate. And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security. But I want to put our resources where I think they\u2019re most needed: Getting rid of any violent person. Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them. When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president. Didn\u2019t even raise it. He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we\u2019re not paying for that wall. So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly.

Welfare reform is one way to do it. If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids don\u2019t lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of families, to get off of welfare, to become independent and self-sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives, the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children. That\u2019s just one example of how you can save money and improve the quality of life at the same time. In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very unwisely. One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance. Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he can\u2019t play little league ball that he can\u2019t go out on the ball field because he\u2019s afraid he\u2019s going to get hurt. And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I don\u2019t think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital. So these are the ways that you help families, you help youngsters to live better lives, and more decent lives. Were ready to go to work at the state and local level, all of us. I know the private sector is. People are all over the country. But it takes presidential leadership. It takes a commitment to being involved and the leading. And that\u2019s the kind of presidency I want to lead."}

There are two very different issues here, and they\u2019ve got to be dealt with separately. I\u2019m opposed to the death penalty. I think everybody knows that. I\u2019m also very tough on violent crime. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in America. It\u2019s one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in the country. It\u2019s one of the reasons why we have a drug education and prevention program that is reaching out and helping youngsters all over our state, the kind of thing I want to do as president of the United States. You know, the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country, which gave last year 7,000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to execute. The issue of abortion is a very difficult issue, one that I think that we all have to wrestle with, we have to come to terms with. I don\u2019t favor abortion. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good thing. I don\u2019t think most people do. The question is who makes the decision. And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision."}

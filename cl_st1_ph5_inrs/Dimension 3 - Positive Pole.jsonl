Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust. Let\u2019s just make that very clear. What I have proposed for a long time, and I\u2019ve had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, let\u2019s be clear and let\u2019s have some straight talk. The Russians are preventing significant action in the United Nations Security Council. I have proposed a league of democracies, a group of people \u2013 a group of countries that share common interests, common values, common ideals, they also control a lot of the world\u2019s economic power. We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect. The Iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues. So I am convinced that together, we can, with the French, with the British, with the Germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect Iranian behavior. But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight. And it is a threat not only in this region but around the world. What I\u2019d also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans, there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran. There is the Republican Guard in Iran, which Senator Kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror. Senator Obama said that would be provocative. So this is a serious threat. This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons."}

Now, let\u2019s take a look at where we\u2019ve gone \u2014 come from. When Barack Obama was elected, they had enough fissile material \u2014 nuclear material to make one bomb. Now they have enough for five. They\u2019re racing toward a nuclear weapon. They\u2019re four years closer toward a nuclear weapons capability. We\u2019ve had four different sanctions, the U.N. on Iran, three from the Bush administration, one here. And the only reason we got it is because Russia watered it down and prevented the \u2014 the sanctions from hitting the central bank. Mitt Romney proposed these sanctions in 2007. In Congress, I\u2019ve been fighting for these sanctions since 2009. The administration was blocking us every step of the way. Only because we had strong bipartisan support for these tough sanctions were we able to overrule their objections and put them in spite of the administration. Imagine what would have happened if we had these sanctions in place earlier. You think Iran\u2019s not brazen? Look at what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019re stepping up their terrorist attacks. They tried a terrorist attack in the United States last year when they tried to blow up the Saudi ambassador at a restaurant in Washington, D.C. And talk about credibility? When this administration says that all options are on the table, they send out senior administration officials that send all these mixed signals. And so, in order to solve this peacefully \u2014 which is everybody\u2019s goal \u2014 you have to have the ayatollahs change their minds. Look at where they are. They\u2019re moving faster toward a nuclear weapon. It\u2019s because this administration has no credibility on this issue. It\u2019s because this administration watered down sanctions, delayed sanctions, tried to stop us for putting the tough sanctions in place. Now we have them in place because of Congress. They say the military option\u2019s on the table, but it\u2019s not being viewed as credible. And the key is to do this peacefully, is to make sure that we have credibility. Under a Romney administration, we will have credibility on this issue."}

And obviously we hope that diplomacy works before you ever use force. The hardest decision a president makes is ever to use force. After 9\/11, we had to look at the world differently. After 9\/11, we had to recognize that when we saw a threat, we must take it seriously before it comes to hurt us. In the old days we\u2019d see a threat, and we could deal with it if we felt like it or not. But 9\/11 changed it all. I vowed to our countrymen that I would do everything I could to protect the American people. That\u2019s why we\u2019re bringing Al Qaida to justice. Seventy five percent of them have been brought to justice. That\u2019s why I said to Afghanistan: If you harbor a terrorist, you\u2019re just as guilty as the terrorist. And the Taliban is no longer in power, and Al Qaida no longer has a place to plan. And I saw a unique threat in Saddam Hussein, as did my opponent, because we thought he had weapons of mass destruction. And the unique threat was that he could give weapons of mass destruction to an organization like Al Qaida, and the harm they inflicted on us with airplanes would be multiplied greatly by weapons of mass destruction. And that was the serious, serious threat. So I tried diplomacy, went to the United Nations. But as we learned in the same report I quoted, Saddam Hussein was gaming the oil-for-food program to get rid of sanctions. He was trying to get rid of sanctions for a reason: He wanted to restart his weapons programs. We all thought there was weapons there, Robin. My opponent thought there was weapons there. That\u2019s why he called him a grave threat. I wasn\u2019t happy when we found out there wasn\u2019t weapons, and we\u2019ve got an intelligence group together to figure out why. But Saddam Hussein was a unique threat. And the world is better off without him in power. And my opponent\u2019s plans lead me to conclude that Saddam Hussein would still be in power, and the world would be more dangerous. Thank you, sir."}

I wrote a book about it several years ago \u2014 six, seven years ago \u2014 called \u201cThe New War,\u201d which saw the difficulties of this international criminal network. And back then, we intercepted a suitcase in a Middle Eastern country with nuclear materials in it. And the black market sale price was about $250 million. Now, there are terrorists trying to get their hands on that stuff today. And this president, I regret to say, has secured less nuclear material in the last two years since 9\/11 than we did in the two years preceding 9\/11. We have to do this job. And to do the job, you can\u2019t cut the money for it. The president actually cut the money for it. You have to put the money into it and the funding and the leadership. And part of that leadership is sending the right message to places like North Korea. Right now the president is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunker-busting nuclear weapons. The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons. It doesn\u2019t make sense. You talk about mixed messages. We\u2019re telling other people, \u201cYou can\u2019t have nuclear weapons,\u201d but we\u2019re pursuing a new nuclear weapon that we might even contemplate using. Not this president.

Now, Senator Obama without precondition wants to sit down and negotiate with them, without preconditions. That\u2019s what he stated, again, a matter of record.

At one of the recent economic summit conferences between myself and the other leaders of the western world, we committed ourselves to take strong action against terrorism. Airplane hijacking was one of the elements of that commitment. There is no doubt that we have seen in recent years \u2013 in recent months \u2013 additional acts of violence against Jews in France and, of course, against those who live in Israel, by the PLO and other terrorist organizations. Ultimately, the most serious terrorist threat is if one of those radical nations, who believe in terrorism as a policy, should have atomic weapons. Both I and all my predecessors have had a deep commitment to controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons. In countries like Libya or Iraq, we have even alienated some of our closest trade partners because we have insisted upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries. When Governor Reagan has been asked about that, he makes the very disturbing comment that non-proliferation, or the control of the spread of nuclear weapons, is none of our business. And recently when he was asked specifically about Iraq, he said there is nothing we can do about it. This ultimate terrorist threat is the most fearsome of all, and it\u2019s part of a pattern where our country must stand firm to control terrorism of all kinds."}

And if Israel is attacked, we have their back, not just diplomatically, not just culturally, but militarily. That\u2019s number one. Number two, with regards to Iran and the threat of Iran, there\u2019s no question but that a nuclear Iran, a nuclear-capable Iran is unacceptable to America. It presents a threat not only to our friends but ultimately a threat to us to have Iran have nuclear material, nuclear weapons that could be used against us or used to be threatening to us. It is also essential for us to understand what our mission is in Iran, and that is to dissuade Iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means. And crippling sanctions are something I called for five years ago, when I was in Israel, speaking at the Herzliya Conference. I laid out seven steps, crippling sanctions were number one. And they do work. You\u2019re seeing it right now in the economy. It\u2019s absolutely the right thing to do, to have crippling sanctions. I would have put them in place earlier. But it\u2019s good that we have them. Number two, something I would add today is I would tighten those sanctions. I would say that ships that carry Iranian oil, can\u2019t come into our ports. I imagine the E.U. would agree with us as well. Not only ships couldn\u2019t, but I\u2019d say companies that are moving their oil can\u2019t, people who are trading in their oil can\u2019t. I would tighten those sanctions further. Secondly, I\u2019d take on diplomatic isolation efforts. I\u2019d make sure that Ahmadinejad is indicted under the Genocide Convention. His words amount to genocide incitation. I would indict him for it. I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world. The same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of South Africa. We need to increase pressure time, and time again on Iran because anything other than a \u2014 a \u2014 a solution to this, which says \u2014 which stops this \u2014 this nuclear folly of theirs, is unacceptable to America. And of course, a military action is the last resort. It is something one would only \u2013 only consider if all of the other avenues had been \u2014 had been tried to their full extent."}

And that\u2019s why proliferation is one of the centerpieces of a multi-prong strategy to make the country safer. My administration started what\u2019s called the Proliferation Security Initiative. Over 60 nations involved with disrupting the trans-shipment of information and\/or weapons of mass destruction materials. And we\u2019ve been effective. We busted the A.Q. Khan network. This was a proliferator out of Pakistan that was selling secrets to places like North Korea and Libya. We convinced Libya to disarm. It\u2019s a central part of dealing with weapons of mass destruction and proliferation. I\u2019ll tell you another way to help protect America in the long run is to continue with missile defenses.

And, Gwen, at the time, I was talking specifically about this question of unilateral sanctions. What happens when we impose unilateral sanctions is, unless there\u2019s a collective effort, then other people move in and take advantage of the situation and you don\u2019t have any impact, except to penalize American companies. We\u2019ve got sanctions on Iran now. We may well want to go to the U.N. Security Council and ask for even tougher sanctions if they don\u2019t live up to their obligations under the initial \u2014 International Atomic Energy Agency Non-Proliferation Treaty. We dealt with Iran differently than we have Iraq partly because Iran has not yet, as Iraq did, violated 12 years of resolutions by the U.N. Security Council. We\u2019re working with the Brits and the Germans and the French, who\u2019ve been negotiating with the Iranians. We recently were actively involved in a meeting with the board of governors in the International Atomic Energy Agency. And as I say, there will be a follow-up meeting in November to determine whether or not Iran\u2019s living up to their commitments and obligations. And if they aren\u2019t, my guess is then the board of governors will recommend sending the whole matter to the U.N. Security Council for the application of the international sanctions, which I think would be exactly the right way to go. We\u2019re addressing North Korea on a similar basis, working with the Chinese, the South Koreans, the Japanese and others to try to bring them around. One of the great by-products, for example, of what we did in Iraq and Afghanistan is that five days after we captured Saddam Hussein, Moammar Gadhafi in Libya came forward and announced that he was going to surrender all of his nuclear materials to the United States, which he has done. This was one of the biggest sources of proliferation in the world today in terms of the threat that was represented by that. The suppliers network that provided that, headed by Mr. A.Q.

We\u2019ve got to lead the world now to crack down on proliferation as a whole. But the president\u2019s been slow to do that, even in Russia. At his pace, it\u2019s going to take 13 years to reduce and get ahold of all the loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union. I\u2019ve proposed a plan that can capture it and contain it and clean it within four years. And the president is moving to the creation of our own bunker- busting nuclear weapon. It\u2019s very hard to get other countries to give up their weapons when you\u2019re busy developing a new one. I\u2019m going to lead the world in the greatest counterproliferation effort. And if we have to get tough with Iran, believe me, we will get tough."}

Since this campaign began I have had a very rare privilege. I have traveled to forty-eight of the fifty states and in my travels I have learned what the people of the United States are thinking about. There is one issue that stands out above all the rest, one in which every American is concerned, regardless of what group he may be a member and regardless of where he may live. And that issue, very simply stated, is this: how can we keep the peace \u2013 keep it without surrender? How can we extend freedom \u2013 extend it without war? Now in determining how we deal with this issue, we must find the answer to a very important but simple question: who threatens the peace? Who threatens freedom in the world? There is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom \u2013 that that is presented by the international Communist movement. And therefore if we are to have peace, we must know how to deal with the Communists and their leaders. I know Mr. Khrushchev. I also have had the opportunity of knowing and meeting other Communist leaders in the world. I believe there are certain principles we must find in dealing with him and his colleagues \u2013 principles, if followed, that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom. First, we have to learn from the past, because we cannot afford to make the mistakes of the past. In the seven years before this Administration came into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain. And at the end of that seven years we were engaged in a war in Korea which cost of thirty thousand American lives. In the past seven years, in President Eisenhower\u2019s Administration, this situation has been reversed. We ended the Korean War; by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars; and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table. Now why were we successful, as our predecessors were not successful? I think there\u2019re several reasons. In the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the Communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world. One of the major errors they made was the one that led to the Korean War. In ruling out the defense of Korea, they invited aggression in that area. They thought they were going to have peace \u2013 it brought war. We learned from their mistakes. And so, in our seven years, we find that we have been firm in our diplomacy; we have never made concessions without getting concessions in return. We have always been willing to go the extra mile to negotiate for disarmament or in any other area. But we have never been willing to do anything that, in effect, surrendered freedom any place in the world. That is why President Eisenhower was correct in not apologizing or expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev at the Paris Conference, as Senator Kennedy suggested he could have done. That is why Senator wh- President Eisenhower was also correct in his policy in the Formosa Straits, where he declined, and refused to follow the recommendations \u2013 recommendations which Senator Kennedy voted for in 1955; again made in 1959; again repeated in his debates that you have heard \u2013 recommendations with regard to \u2013 again \u2013 slicing off a piece of free territory, and abandoning it, if \u2013 in effect, to the Communists. Why did the President feel this was wrong and why was the President right and his critics wrong? Because again this showed a lack of understanding of dictators, a lack of understanding particularly of Communists, because every time you make such a concession it does not lead to peace; it only encourages them to blackmail you. It encourages them to begin a war. And so I say that the record shows that we know how to keep the peace, to keep it without surrender. Let us move now to the future. It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical\u2026 leaders that the world has ever seen. That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area. First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have \u2013 if the should launch a surprise attack \u2013 we will be able to destroy their war-making capability. They must know, in other words, that it is national suicide if they begin anything. We need this kind of strength because we\u2019re the guardians of the peace. In addition to military strength, we need to see that the economy of this country continues to grow. It has grown in the past seven years. It can and will grow even more in the next four. And the reason that it must grow even more is because we have things to do at home and also because we\u2019re in a race for survival \u2013 a race in which it isn\u2019t enough to be ahead; it isn\u2019t enough simply to be complacent. We have to move ahead in order to stay ahead. And that is why, in this field, I have made recommendations which I am confident will move the American economy ahead \u2013 move it firmly and soundly so that there will never be a time when the Soviet Union will be able to challenge our superiority in this field. And so we need military strength, we need economic strength, we also need the right diplomatic policies. What are they? Again we turn to the past. Firmness but no belligerence, and by no belligerence I mean that we do not answer insult by insult. When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues. And that example that President Eisenhower has set we will continue to follow. But all this by itself is not enough. It is not enough for us simply to be the strongest nation militarily, the strongest economically, and also to have firm diplomacy. We must have a great goal. And that is: not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world, to extend it to all the world because that is America\u2019s destiny. To extend it to all the world because the Communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend Communism. And you cannot fight a victory for Communism or a strategy of victory for Communism with the strategy, simply of holding the line. And so I say that we believe that our policies of military strength, of economic strength, of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep it without surrender. We also believe that in the great field of ideals that we can lead America to the victory for freedom \u2013 victory in the newly developing countries, victory also in the captive countries \u2013 provided we have faith in ourselves and faith in our principles."}

We cannot allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon. It would be a game-changer in the region. Not only would it threaten Israel, our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world, but it would also create a possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists. And so it\u2019s unacceptable. And I will do everything that\u2019s required to prevent it. And we will never take military options off the table. And it is important that we don\u2019t provide veto power to the United Nations or anyone else in acting in our interests. It is important, though, for us to use all the tools at our disposal to prevent the scenario where we\u2019ve got to make those kinds of choices. And that\u2019s why I have consistently said that, if we can work more effectively with other countries diplomatically to tighten sanctions on Iran, if we can reduce our energy consumption through alternative energy, so that Iran has less money, if we can impose the kinds of sanctions that, say, for example, Iran right now imports gasoline, even though it\u2019s an oil-producer, because its oil infrastructure has broken down, if we can prevent them from importing the gasoline that they need and the refined petroleum products, that starts changing their cost-benefit analysis. That starts putting the squeeze on them. Now, it is true, though, that I believe that we should have direct talks \u2014 not just with our friends, but also with our enemies \u2014 to deliver a tough, direct message to Iran that, if you don\u2019t change your behavior, then there will be dire consequences. If you do change your behavior, then it is possible for you to re-join the community of nations. Now, it may not work. But one of the things we\u2019ve learned is, is that when we take that approach, whether it\u2019s in North Korea or in Iran, then we have a better chance at better outcomes. When President Bush decided we\u2019re not going to talk to Iran, we\u2019re not going to talk to North Korea, you know what happened? Iran went from zero centrifuges to develop nuclear weapons to 4,000. North Korea quadrupled its nuclear capability. We\u2019ve got to try to have talks, understanding that we\u2019re not taking military options off the table."}

It\u2019s a nation that\u2019s not like \u2014 like others and it does not have a civilian leadership that is calling the shots there. You have the ISI, their intelligence organization, is probably the most powerful of the \u2014 of three branches there. Then you have the military and then you have the civilian government. This is a nation, which, if it falls apart, if it \u2014 if it becomes a failed state, there are nuclear weapons there and you\u2019ve got \u2014 you\u2019ve got terrorists there who could grab their \u2014 their hands onto those nuclear weapons. This is \u2014 this is an important part of the world for us. Pakistan is \u2014 is technically an ally, and they\u2019re not acting very much like an ally right now. But we have some work to do. And I \u2014 I don\u2019t blame the administration for the fact that the relationship with Pakistan is strained. We \u2014 we had to go into Pakistan. We had to go in there to get Osama bin Laden. That was the right thing to do. And \u2014 and that upset them, but obviously there was a great deal of anger even before that. But we\u2019re going to have to work with the \u2014 with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that they\u2019re on. And it\u2019s important for them. It\u2019s important for the nuclear weapons. It\u2019s important for the success of Afghanistan. Because inside Pakistan, you have a \u2014 a large group of Pashtun that are \u2014 that are Taliban. They\u2019re going to come rushing back in to Afghanistan when we go. And that\u2019s one of the reasons the Afghan Security Forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that. But it\u2019s important for us to recognize that we can\u2019t just walk away from Pakistan.

The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because an Iranian nuclear weapons program has been stopped. The terrorist threat to United States troops has been decreased in some ways because there\u2019s not 175,000 in a dangerous part of the world. There\u2019s only 15,000. But there are other parts of the world that are challenging. Let me tell you this - To beat terrorism, there\u2019s only one candidate who can do it, and it\u2019s Hillary Clinton. Remember, Hillary Clinton was the senator from New York on 9\/11. She was there at the World Trade Center when they were still searching for victims and survivors. That\u2019s seared onto her, the need to beat terrorism. And she\u2019s got a plan to do it. She was part of the national security team that wiped out bin Laden. Here\u2019s her plan to defeat ISIL. First, we\u2019ve got to keep taking out their leaders on the battlefield. She was part of the team that got bin Laden, and she\u2019ll lead the team that will get Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS. Second, we\u2019ve got to disrupt financing networks, third, disrupt their ability to recruit on the Internet, in their safe havens. But, fourth, we also have to work with allies to share and surge intelligence. That\u2019s the Hillary Clinton plan; she\u2019s got the experience to do it. Donald Trump. Donald Trump can\u2019t start a Twitter war with Miss Universe without shooting himself in the foot. Donald Trump doesn\u2019t have a plan. He said, \u201cI have a secret plan,\u201d and then he said, \u201cUm, I know more than all the generals about ISIL.\u201d And then he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to call the generals to help me figure out a plan.\u201d And finally he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to fire all the generals.\u201d He doesn\u2019t have a plan. But he does have dangerous ideas. Here\u2019s four. He trash talks the military. The military is a disaster, John McCain\u2019s no hero, the generals need all to be fired, and I know more than them. He wants to tear up alliances. NATO is obsolete, and we\u2019ll only work together with Israel if they pay \u201cbig league.\u201d Third, he loves dictators.

First of all, when we and our allies \u2014 the Italians, the French, and the United Kingdom \u2014 went into Lebanon, we went in there at the request of what was left of the Lebanese Government to be a stabilizing force while they tried to establish a government. But the first \u2014 pardon me \u2014 the first time we went in, we went in at their request because the war was going on right in Beirut between Israel and the PLO terrorists. Israel could not be blamed for that. Those terrorists had been violating their northern border consistently, and Israel chased them all the way to there. Then we went in with the multinational force to help remove, and did remove, more than 13,000 of those terrorists from Lebanon. We departed. And then the Government of Lebanon asked us back in as a stabilizing force while they established a government and sought to get the foreign forces all the way out of Lebanon and that they could then take care of their own borders. And we were succeeding. We were there for the better part of a year. Our position happened to be at the airport. Oh, there were occasional snipings and sometimes some artillery fire, but we did not engage in conflict that was out of line with our mission. I will never send troops anywhere on a mission of that kind without telling them that if somebody shoots at them, they can darn well shoot back. And this is what we did. We never initiated any kind of action; we defended ourselves there. But we were succeeding to the point that the Lebanese Government had been organized \u2014 if you will remember, there were the meetings in Geneva in which they began to meet with the hostile factional forces and try to put together some kind of a peace plan. We were succeeding, and that was why the terrorist acts began. There are forces there \u2014 and that includes Syria, in my mind \u2014 who don\u2019t want us to succeed, who don\u2019t want that kind of a peace with a dominant Lebanon, dominant over its own territory. And so, the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing of the building. Then the multilateral force withdrew for only one reason: We withdrew because we were no longer able to carry out the mission for which we had been sent in. But we went in in the interest of peace and to keep Israel and Syria from getting into the sixth war between them. And I have no apologies for our going on a peace mission."}

We\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re hardening our chemical sites. We haven\u2019t done enough in terms of transit; we haven\u2019t done enough in terms of ports. And the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies. It\u2019s in a suitcase. This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important. It is the \u2014 the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons. And we \u2014 we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense. And I actually believe that we need missile defense, because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but I also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then we\u2019re making a mistake. The other thing that we have to focus on, though, is Al Qaida. They are now operating in 60 countries. We can\u2019t simply be focused on Iraq. We have to go to the root cause, and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan. That\u2019s going to be critical. We are going to need more cooperation with our allies. And one last point I want to make. It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism. And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore America\u2019s standing in the world. We are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago.

I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization. I\u2019ve consistently said so. What Senator McCain refers to is a measure in the Senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of Iraq. To deal with Iran. And ironically, the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq. Iraq was Iran\u2019s mortal enemy. That was cleared away. And what we\u2019ve seen over the last several years is Iran\u2019s influence grow. They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon. So obviously, our policy over the last eight years has not worked. Senator McCain is absolutely right, we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran. It would be a game changer. Not only would it threaten Israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this Middle East. Now here\u2019s what we need to do. We do need tougher sanctions. I do not agree with Senator McCain that we\u2019re going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with countries like Russia and China that are, I think Senator McCain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesn\u2019t have a nuclear weapon. But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked. It has not worked in Iran, it has not worked in North Korea. In each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons.

First of all, let\u2019s talk about this troop funding issue because John always brings this up. Senator McCain cut \u2014 Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn\u2019t believe in a timetable. I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush. We had a difference on the timetable. We didn\u2019t have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops. We had a legitimate difference, and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy. And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there. The question is, was this wise? We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate. We need more troops there. We need more resources there. Senator McCain, in the rush to go into Iraq, said, you know what? We\u2019ve been successful in Afghanistan. There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there. This is a time when bin Laden was still out, and now they\u2019ve reconstituted themselves. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in Afghanistan and it needs to end there. But we can\u2019t do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country. Now, what I\u2019ve said is we should end this war responsibly. We should do it in phases. But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put \u2014 provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda. And right now, the commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have acknowledged that we don\u2019t have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge."}

During their, that, in three and a half years, three separate leaders. The Soviets have not been willing to talk. We are the ones that went to the table in INF. We had a good proposal, a moral proposal. Ban an entire generation of intermediate nuclear force weapons and if you won\u2019t do that, don\u2019t leave your allies in Europe in a monopoly position. The Soviets with 1,200 of these things, and the alliance with none. We didn\u2019t think that\u2019s the way to deter aggression and keep the peace. The president went, the first thing he did when he came into office was make a proposal on the most destabilizing weapons of all, START. And when the the strategic weapon and when the Soviets said, well, we don\u2019t like that proposal, we said all right, we\u2019ll be more flexible. I at the urging of the president went to Geneva and laid on the table a treaty to ban all chemical weapons. We don\u2019t want them to have a monopoly. We said look, let\u2019s come together. You come over here and see what we\u2019re doing; we\u2019ll go over there and see what you\u2019re doing. But let\u2019s save the kids of this world from chemical weapons. A brilliant proposal to get rid of all of them. And the Soviets nyet, nyet nyet. In the mutual balance force reduction to reduce conventional forces, they\u2019re not even willing to tell us the base. Mrs. Ferraro knows that, and how many troops they have. There\u2019s four sessions. We have had an agreement with them on the hot line. But Carter-Monad made an agreement, the Salt II agreement, but the Democratic Senate, they were a Democratic administration, the Democratic Senate wouldn\u2019t even ratify that agreement. It was flawed, it was unverifiable and it was not good. Our president wants to reduce, not just to stop, he wants to reduce dramatically nuclear weapons. And when the Soviets know they\u2019re going to have this strong president to deal with, and when this new administration, Mr. Chernenko, given more than a few months in office can solidify its position, then they\u2019ll talk.

We\u2019re in the serious stages of negotiation with the Soviet Union on the strategic arms control talks. And we\u2019re protecting a couple of options in terms of modernizing our strategic forces. My Secretary of Defense is going to have to make a very difficult decision in which system to go forward with. But we are protecting both of them. We are moving forward with negotiations and, you see, I just think it would be dumb negotiating policy with the Soviets to cut out one or the other of the two options right now. The Soviets are modernizing. They continue to modernize and we can\u2019t simply we\u2019ve got enough nuclear weapons, let\u2019s freeze. We can\u2019t do that. We have to have modernization, especially if we achieve the 50 percent reduction in strategic weapons that our President is taking the leadership to attain. And, so, that\u2019s the way I\u2019d reply to it and I believe we can have the strongest and best defense possible if we modernize, if we go forward with competitive strategies and if we do follow through on the Packard Commission report."}

We\u2019ll have to see if that happens. The thing about Iraq, of course, was at the end of the war we had pretty well decimated their military. We had put them back in the box, so to speak. We had a strong international coalition raid against them, effective economic sanctions, and a very robust inspection regime was in place under the U.N. auspices and it was able to do a good job of stripping out the capacity to build weapons of mass destruction, the work he had been doing that had not been destroyed during the war in biological and chemical agents, as well as a nuclear program. Unfortunately now we find ourselves in a situation where that started to fray on us, where the coalition now no longer is tied tightly together. Recently the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, two Gulf States, have reopened diplomatic relations with Baghdad. The Russians and French are flying commercial airliners back into Baghdad and thumbing their nose at the international sanctions regime, and of course U.N. inspectors have been kicked out and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been absolutely no response. . We\u2019re in a situation today where our posture with Iraq is weaker than it was at the end of the war. It\u2019s unfortunate. I also think it\u2019s unfortunate we find ourselves in a position where we don\u2019t know for sure what might be transpiring inside Iraq. I certainly hope he\u2019s not regenerating that kind of capability, but if he were, if in fact Saddam Hussein were taking steps to try to rebuild nuclear capability or weapons of mass destruction, you would have to give very serious consideration to military action to \u2014 to stop that activity.

During the time that I have served on the Intelligence Committee in the Senate, traveling to some of the places we\u2019ve talked about tonight \u2014 Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Middle East, Turkey \u2014 meeting with the leaders of NATO, I have a very clear idea of what has to be done to keep this country safe. The threats we face - terrorism, killing terrorists and stopping them before they can do damage to us, making sure that we stop the spread of nuclear weapons. I agree with John Kerry from Thursday night, that the danger of nuclear weapons getting in the hands of terrorists is one of the greatest threats that America faces.

That\u2019s just the truth, and the American people know that and deserve to know it. But what we know from this administration is that a long resume does not equal good judgment. Here are the judgments I would make - My first priority would be to keep this country safe. I would find terrorists where they are and stop them and kill them before they do harm to us. We would stop the spread of nuclear weapons. And we would also strengthen this military, which means providing the equipment and training that they need. We want to raise the active-duty forces by 40,000, double the special forces so we can find terrorists where they are, and provide the kind of support for families \u2014 health care, housing \u2014 that they deserve while their loved ones are serving and protecting us.

What we know is that the president and the vice president have not done the work to build the coalition that we need \u2014 dramatically different than the first Gulf War. We know that they haven\u2019t done it, and we know they can\u2019t do it. They didn\u2019t, by the way, just reject the allies going into lead- up to the war. They also rejected them in the effort to do the reconstruction in Iraq, and that has consequences. What we believe is, as part of our entire plan for Iraq \u2014 and we have a plan for Iraq. They have a plan for Iraq too - more of the same. We have a plan for success. And that plan includes speeding up the training of the military. We have less than half of the staff that we need there to complete that training. Second, make sure that the reconstruction is sped up in a way that the Iraqis see some tangible benefit for what\u2019s happening. And by the way, if we need to, we can take Iraqis out of Iraq to train them. It is not secure enough. It\u2019s so dangerous on the ground that they can\u2019t be trained there. We can take them out of Iraq for purposes of training. We should do whatever has to be done to train the Iraqis and to speed up that process. That works in conjunction with making sure the elections take place on time. Right now, the United Nations, which is responsible for the elections in January, has about 35 people there. Now, that\u2019s compared with a much smaller country like East Timor, where they had over 200 people on the ground. You need more than 35 people to hold an election in Cleveland, much less in Iraq. And they keep saying the election\u2019s on schedule, this is going to happen. The reality is we need a new president with credibility with the rest of the world and who has a real plan for success. Success breeds contribution, breeds joining the coalition. Not only that, I want to go back to what the vice president said. He attacks us about the troops. They sent 40,000 American troops into Iraq without the body armor they needed. They sent them without the armored vehicles they needed. While they were on the ground fighting, they lobbied the Congress to cut their combat pay. This is the height of hypocrisy."}

It\u2019s a very important event, and they\u2019ve done a superb job of putting it together. It\u2019s important to look at all of our developments in Iraq within the broader context of the global war on terror. And, after 9\/11, it became clear that we had to do several things to have a successful strategy to win the global war on terror, specifically that we had to go after the terrorists wherever we might find them, that we also had to go after state sponsors of terror, those who might provide sanctuary or safe harbor for terror. And we also then finally had to stand up democracies in their stead afterwards, because that was the only way to guarantee that these states would not again become safe harbors for terror or for the development of deadly weapons. Concern about Iraq specifically focused on the fact that Saddam Hussein had been, for years, listed on the state sponsor of terror, that they he had established relationships with Abu Nidal, who operated out of Baghdad; he paid $25,000 to the families of suicide bombers; and he had an established relationship with Al Qaida. Specifically, look at George Tenet, the CIA director\u2019s testimony before the Committee on Foreign Relations two years ago when he talked about a 10-year relationship. The effort that we\u2019ve mounted with respect to Iraq focused specifically on the possibility that this was the most likely nexus between the terrorists and weapons of mass destruction. The biggest threat we faced today is the possibility of terrorists smuggling a nuclear weapon or a biological agent into one of our own cities and threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans. What we did in Iraq was exactly the right thing to do. If I had it to recommend all over again, I would recommend exactly the same course of action. The world is far safer today because Saddam Hussein is in jail, his government is no longer in power. And we did exactly the right thing."}

I\u2019ve been saying that for over a year now. And I think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because it\u2019s been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better. We had the highest fatalities among U.S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002. And we are seeing a major offensive taking place \u2014 Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion. They are feeling emboldened. And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we don\u2019t have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan. So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan. Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9\/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no Al Qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan. And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front \u2014 that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan. So here\u2019s what we have to do comprehensively, though. It\u2019s not just more troops. We have to press the Afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people. And I\u2019ve said this to President Karzai. Number two, we\u2019ve got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years. Number three, we\u2019ve got to deal with Pakistan, because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, we\u2019ve been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens.

And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds.

They are not true. But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been in place. Because they have the opportunity to reenter the community of nations, and we would welcome that. There \u2014 there are people in Iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world for a better life. And we hope that their leadership takes the right decision, but the deal we\u2019ll accept is they end their nuclear program. It\u2019s very straightforward. And I\u2019m glad that Governor Romney agrees with the steps that we\u2019re taking. You know, there have been times, Governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that you\u2019d do the same things we did, but you\u2019d say them louder and somehow that \u2014 that would make a difference. And it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking. It\u2019s meticulous. We started from the day we got into office. And the reason is was so important \u2014 and this is a testament to how we\u2019ve restored American credibility and strength around the world \u2014 is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like Russia and China. Because if it\u2019s just us that are imposing sanctions \u2014 we\u2019ve had sanctions in place a long time. It\u2019s because we got everybody to agree that Iran is seeing so much pressure. And we\u2019ve got to maintain that pressure. There is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established. They convince the international community they are not pursuing a nuclear program. There are inspections that are very intrusive. But over time, what they can do is regain credibility. In the meantime, though, we\u2019re not going to let up the pressure until we have clear evidence that that takes place. And one last thing \u2014 just \u2014 just to make this point. The clock is ticking. We\u2019re not going to allow Iran to perpetually engage in negotiations that lead nowhere. And I\u2019ve been very clear to them. You know, because of the intelligence coordination that we do with a range of countries, including Israel, we have a sense of when they would get breakout capacity, which means that we would not be able to intervene in time to stop their nuclear program. And that clock is ticking. And we\u2019re going to make sure that if they do not meet the demands of the international community, then we are going to take all options necessary to make sure they don\u2019t have a nuclear weapon."}

Uh \u2013 First of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference. This means at the secretary of state level and at the ambassadorial level. By adequate preparation I mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda, an agenda agreed upon with the approval of the heads of state involved. Now this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation. I don\u2019t believe we should go to a summit conference unless we have such an agenda, unless we have some reasonable insur- assurance from Mr. Khrushchev that he intends seriously to negotiate on those points. Now this may seem like a rigid, inflexible position. But let\u2019s look at the other side of the coin. If we build up the hopes of the world by having a summit conference that is not adequately prepared, and then, if Mr. Khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up \u2013 as he did this one \u2013 because he isn\u2019t going to get his way \u2013 we\u2019d set back the cause of peace. We do not help it. We can, in other words, negotiate many of these items of difference between us without going to the summit. I think we have to make a greater effort than we have been making at the secretary of state level, at the ambassadorial level, to work out the differences that we have. And so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit \u2013 a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it is. When I say \u201cphony spirit,\u201d I mean phony, not because the spirit is not good on our side, but because the Soviet Union simply doesn\u2019t intend to carry out what they say.

Then I believe that we should move full time on our missile production, particularly on Minuteman and on Polaris. It may be a long period, but we must \u2013 we must get started immediately. Now on the question of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, I must say that I feel that another effort should be made by a new Administration in January of 1961, to renew negotiations with the Soviet Union and see whether it\u2019s possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chances of contamination of the atmosphere, and also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity. There are indications, because of new inventions, that ten, fifteen, or twenty nations will have a nuclear capacity \u2013 including Red China \u2013 by the end of the presidential office in 1964. This is extremely serious. There have been many wars in the history of mankind. And to take a chance uh \u2013 now be \u2013 and not make every effort that we could make to provide for some control over these weapons, I think would be a great mistake. One of my disagreements with the present Administration has been that I don\u2019t feel a real effort has been made an this very sensitive subject, not only of nuclear controls, but also of general disarmament. Less than a hundred people have been working throughout the entire federal government on this subject, and I believe it\u2019s been reflected in our success and failures at Geneva. Now, we may not succeed. The Soviet Union may not agree to an inspection system. We may be able to get satisfactory assurances. It may be necessary for us to begin testing again. But I hope the next Administration \u2013 and if I have anything to do with it, the next Administration will \u2013 make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels. These must be done. If we cannot succeed, then we must strengthen ourselves. But I would make the effort because I think the fate not only of our own civilization, but I think the fate of world and the future of the human race is involved in preventing a nuclear war."}

If President Brezhnev said, we will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American Presidents over a seven-year period of time, we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, it\u2019s obvious that I, as President, and all Americans, would reject such a proposition.

Since I became president, 43, 44 countries have gone democratic, no longer totalitarian, no longer living under dictatorship or communist rule. This is exciting. New world order to me means freedom and democracy. I think we will have a continuing responsibility, as the only remaining superpower, to stay involved. If we pull back in some isolation and say we don\u2019t have to do our share, or more than our share, anymore, I believe you are going to just ask for conflagration that we\u2019ll get involved in the future. NATO, for example, has kept the peace for many, many years, and I want to see us keep fully staffed in NATO so we\u2019ll continue to guarantee the peace in Europe. But the exciting thing is, the fear of nuclear war is down. And you hear all the bad stuff that\u2019s happened on my watch; I hope people will recognize that this is something pretty good for mankind. I hope they\u2019ll think it\u2019s good that democracy and freedom is on the move. And we\u2019re going to stay engaged, as long as I\u2019m president, working to improve things. You know, it\u2019s so easy now to say, hey, cut out foreign aid, we got a problem at home. I think the US has to still have the Statue of Liberty as a symbol, caring for others. Right this very minute we\u2019re sending supplies in to help these little starving kids in Somalia. It\u2019s the US that\u2019s taken the lead in humanitarian aid into Bosnia. We\u2019re doing this all around the world. Yes, we got problems at home. And I think I got a good plan to help fix those problems at home. But because of our leadership, because we didn\u2019t listen to the freeze \u2014 the nuclear-freeze group, do you remember \u2014 freeze it, back in the late 70s \u2014 freeze, don\u2019t touch it; we\u2019re going to lock it in now or else we\u2019ll have war. President Reagan said no, peace through strength. It worked. The Soviet Union is no more, and now we\u2019re working to help them become totally democratic through the Freedom Support Act that I led on, a great Democratic ambassador, Bob Strauss, over there, Jim Baker, all of us got this thing passed \u2014 through cooperation, Ross \u2014 it worked with cooperation, and you\u2019re for that, I\u2019m sure, helping Russia become democratic. So the new world order to me means freedom and democracy, keep engaged, do not pull back into isolation. And we are the US, and we have a responsibility to lead and to guarantee the security. If it hadn\u2019t been for us, Saddam Hussein would be sitting on top of three-fifths of the oil supply of the world and he\u2019d have nuclear weapons. And only the US could do this.

I want everybody to know should I be the president Israel\u2019s going to be our friend. I\u2019m going to stand by Israel. Secondly, that I think it\u2019s important to reach out to moderate Arab nations, like Jordan and Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. It\u2019s important to be friends with people when you don\u2019t need each other so that when you do there\u2019s a strong bond of friendship. And that\u2019s going to be particularly important in dealing not only with situations such as now occurring in Israel, but with Saddam Hussein. The coalition against Saddam has fallen apart or it\u2019s unraveling, let\u2019s put it that way. The sanctions are being violated. We don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s developing weapons of mass destruction. He better not be or there\u2019s going to be a consequence should I be the president. But it\u2019s important to have credibility and credibility is formed by being strong with your friends and resolute in your determination. One of the reasons why I think it\u2019s important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace to be able to say to the Saddam Hussein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of the world or the Iranians, don\u2019t dare threaten our friends. It\u2019s also important to keep strong ties in the Middle East, credible ties, because of the energy crisis we\u2019re now in. After all, a lot of the energy is produced from the Middle East, and so I appreciate what the administration is doing. I hope to get a sense of should I be fortunate to be the president how my administration will react to the Middle East."}

Now, remember, we went into Afghanistan, which, by the way, was the right thing to do. That was the right decision. And our military performed terrifically there. But we had Osama bin Laden cornered at Tora Bora. We had the 10th Mountain Division up in Uzbekistan available. We had the finest military in the world on the ground. And what did we do? We turned \u2014 this is the man who masterminded the greatest mass murder and terrorist attack in American history. And what did the administration decide to do? They gave the responsibility of capturing and\/or killing Saddam \u2014 I mean Osama bin Laden to Afghan warlords who, just a few weeks before, had been working with Osama bin Laden. Our point in this is not complicated - We were attacked by Al Qaida and Osama bin Laden. We went into Afghanistan and very quickly the administration made a decision to divert attention from that and instead began to plan for the invasion of Iraq. And these connections \u2014 I want the American people to hear this very clearly. Listen carefully to what the vice president is saying. Because there is no connection between Saddam Hussein and the attacks of September 11th \u2014 period. The 9\/11 Commission has said that\u2019s true. Colin Powell has said it\u2019s true.

And at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six-party \u2014 or the six-point cease-fire. They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship. And we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region, you know, the Estonians, the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the Poles, the Czechs, that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts. They are members of NATO. And to countries like Georgia and the Ukraine, I think we have to insist that they are free to join NATO if they meet the requirements, and they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in. Now, we also can\u2019t return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia. It\u2019s important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest. One is nuclear proliferation. They have not only 15,000 nuclear warheads, but they\u2019ve got enough to make another 40,000, and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of Al Qaida.

That\u2019s an area where we\u2019re going to have to work with Russia.

I also \u2013 know that as far as the human beings on this earth are concerned that the nonproliferation of atomic weapons is number one. Only the last few days with the election approaching, has Mr. Ford taken any interest in a nonproliferation movement. I advocated last May in a speech at the United Nations that we move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear devices, both weapons and peaceful devices; that we not ship any more atomic fuel to a country that refuses to comply with strict controls over the waste which can be reprocessed into explosives. I\u2019ve also advocated that we stop the sale by Germany and France of \u2013 processing plants for Pakistan and Brazil. Mr. Ford hasn\u2019t moved on this. We also need to provide an adequate supply of enriched uranium.

This kind of confusion and absence of leadership has let us drift now for two years with a constantly increasing threat of atomic weapons throughout the world.

Every President who has served in the Oval Office since Harry Truman has been dedicated to the proposition of controlling nuclear weapons. To negotiate with the Soviet Union a balanced, controlled, observable, and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry, there is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of Governor Reagan. He has never supported any of those arms control agreements \u2013 the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford \u2013 and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a seven-year period, by myself and my two Republican predecessors. The Senate has not voted yet on the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty. There have been preliminary skirmishing in the committees of the Senate, but the Treaty has never come to the floor of the Senate for either a debate or a vote.

You\u2019ve got 99 other senators to correct that mistake, if it is a mistake.

I am not going to roll over, as Mr. Mondale suggests, and give them something that could turn around and be used against us.

I didn\u2019t say I would bring troops out in six months. I said, if we do the things that I\u2019ve set out and we are successful, we could begin to draw the troops down in six months. And I think a critical component of success in Iraq is being able to convince the Iraqis and the Arab world that the United States doesn\u2019t have long-term designs on it. As I understand it, we\u2019re building some 14 military bases there now, and some people say they\u2019ve got a rather permanent concept to them. When you guard the oil ministry, but you don\u2019t guard the nuclear facilities, the message to a lot of people is maybe, \u201cWow, maybe they\u2019re interested in our oil.\u201d Now, the problem is that they didn\u2019t think these things through properly. And these are the things you have to think through. What I want to do is change the dynamics on the ground. And you have to do that by beginning to not back off of the Fallujahs and other places, and send the wrong message to the terrorists. You have to close the borders. You\u2019ve got to show you\u2019re serious in that regard. But you\u2019ve also got to show that you are prepared to bring the rest of the world in and share the stakes. I will make a flat statement - The United States of America has no long-term designs on staying in Iraq. And our goal in my administration would be to get all of the troops out of there with a minimal amount you need for training and logistics as we do in some other countries in the world after a war to be able to sustain the peace. But that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to win the peace, by rapidly training the Iraqis themselves. Even the administration has admitted they haven\u2019t done the training, because they came back to Congress a few weeks ago and asked for a complete reprogramming of the money. Now what greater admission is there, 16 months afterwards. \u201cOops, we haven\u2019t done the job. We have to start to spend the money now. Will you guys give us permission to shift it over into training?\u201d"}

But what he has said is that, even knowing there were no weapons of mass destruction, even knowing there was no imminent threat, even knowing there was no connection with Al Qaida, he would still have done everything the same way. Those are his words. Now, I would not. So what I\u2019m trying to do is just talk the truth to the American people and to the world. The truth is what good policy is based on. It\u2019s what leadership is based on. The president says that I\u2019m denigrating these troops. I have nothing but respect for the British, Tony Blair, and for what they\u2019ve been willing to do. But you can\u2019t tell me that when the most troops any other country has on the ground is Great Britain, with 8,300, and below that the four others are below 4,000, and below that, there isn\u2019t anybody out of the hundreds, that we have a genuine coalition to get this job done. You can\u2019t tell me that on the day that we went into that war and it started \u2014 it was principally the United States, the America and Great Britain and one or two others. That\u2019s it. And today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the costs. And meanwhile, North Korea has got nuclear weapons. Talk about mixed messages. The president is the one that said, \u201cWe can\u2019t allow countries to get nuclear weapons.\u201d They have. I\u2019ll change that."}

And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019ve got 100,000 trained now, 125,000 by the end of this year, 200,000 by the end of next year. That is the best way. We\u2019ll never succeed in Iraq if the Iraqi citizens do not want to take matters into their own hands to protect themselves. I believe they want to. Prime Minister Allawi believes they want to. And so the best indication about when we can bring our troops home \u2014 which I really want to do, but I don\u2019t want to do so for the sake of bringing them home; I want to do so because we\u2019ve achieved an objective \u2014 is to see the Iraqis perform and to see the Iraqis step up and take responsibility. And so, the answer to your question is - When our general is on the ground and Ambassador Negroponte tells me that Iraq is ready to defend herself from these terrorists, that elections will have been held by then, that their stability and that they\u2019re on their way to, you know, a nation that\u2019s free; that\u2019s when. And I hope it\u2019s as soon as possible. But I know putting artificial deadlines won\u2019t work. My opponent at one time said, \u201cWell, get me elected, I\u2019ll have them out of there in six months.\u201d You can\u2019t do that and expect to win the war on terror. My message to our troops is, \u201cThank you for what you\u2019re doing. We\u2019re standing with you strong. We\u2019ll give you all the equipment you need. And we\u2019ll get you home as soon as the mission\u2019s done, because this is a vital mission.\u201d A free Iraq will be an ally in the war on terror, and that\u2019s essential. A free Iraq will set a powerful example in the part of the world that is desperate for freedom. A free Iraq will help secure Israel. A free Iraq will enforce the hopes and aspirations of the reformers in places like Iran. A free Iraq is essential for the security of this country."}

And I will hunt down and kill the terrorists, wherever they are. But we also have to be smart, Jim. And smart means not diverting your attention from the real war on terror in Afghanistan against Osama bin Laden and taking if off to Iraq where the 9\/11 Commission confirms there was no connection to 9\/11 itself and Saddam Hussein, and where the reason for going to war was weapons of mass destruction, not the removal of Saddam Hussein. This president has made, I regret to say, a colossal error of judgment. And judgment is what we look for in the president of the United States of America. I\u2019m proud that important military figures who are supporting me in this race: former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili; just yesterday, General Eisenhower\u2019s son, General John Eisenhower, endorsed me; General Admiral William Crown; General Tony McBeak, who ran the Air Force war so effectively for his father \u2014 all believe I would make a stronger commander in chief. And they believe it because they know I would not take my eye off of the goal: Osama bin Laden. Unfortunately, he escaped in the mountains of Tora Bora. We had him surrounded. But we didn\u2019t use American forces, the best trained in the world, to go kill him. The president relied on Afghan warlords and he outsourced that job too. That\u2019s wrong."}

September the 11th changed how America must look at the world. And since that day, our nation has been on a multi-pronged strategy to keep our country safer. We pursued Al Qaida wherever Al Qaida tries to hide. Seventy-five percent of known Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice. The rest of them know we\u2019re after them. We\u2019ve upheld the doctrine that said if you harbor a terrorist, you\u2019re equally as guilty as the terrorist. And the Taliban are no longer in power. Ten million people have registered to vote in Afghanistan in the upcoming presidential election. In Iraq, we saw a threat, and we realized that after September the 11th, we must take threats seriously, before they fully materialize. Saddam Hussein now sits in a prison cell. America and the world are safer for it. We continue to pursue our policy of disrupting those who proliferate weapons of mass destruction. Libya has disarmed. The A.Q. Khan network has been brought to justice. And, as well, we\u2019re pursuing a strategy of freedom around the world, because I understand free nations will reject terror.

The fact of the matter is the troops wouldn\u2019t have what they have today if you guys had had your way. You talk about internationalizing the effort. They don\u2019t have a plan. Basically, it\u2019s an echo. You made the comment that the Gulf War coalition in \u201991 was far stronger than this. No. We had 34 countries then; we\u2019ve got 30 today. We\u2019ve got troops beside us. It\u2019s hard, after John Kerry referred to our allies as a coalition of the coerced and the bribed, to go out and persuade people to send troops and to participate in this process. You end up with a situation in which \u2014 talk about demeaning. In effect, you demean the sacrifice of our allies when you say it\u2019s the wrong war, wrong place, wrong time, and oh, by the way, send troops. Makes no sense at all. It\u2019s totally inconsistent. There isn\u2019t a plan there. Our most important ally in the war on terror, in Iraq specifically, is Prime Minister Allawi. He came recently and addressed a joint session of Congress that I presided over with the speaker of the House. And John Kerry rushed out immediately after his speech was over with, where he came and he thanked America for our contributions and our sacrifice and pledged to hold those elections in January, went out and demeaned him, criticized him, challenged his credibility. That is not the way to win friends and allies. You\u2019re never going to add to the coalition with that kind of attitude. IFILL: Senator Edwards, 30 seconds."}

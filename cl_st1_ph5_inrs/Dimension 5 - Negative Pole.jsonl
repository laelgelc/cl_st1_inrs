NIXON","Party":"Republican","Factor 1":9,"Factor 2":88,"Factor 3":14,"Factor 4":-4,"Factor 5":-14,"Factor 6":4,"Dimension":"Dimension 5","Pole":"Negative Pole","Label":"Dimension 5 - Negative Pole - Label: <Placeholder for Label>","Description":"Dimension 5 - Negative Pole - Description: <Placeholder for Description>","Text":"Mr. Howe, Senator Kennedy, my fellow Americans. Since this campaign began I have had a very rare privilege. I have traveled to forty-eight of the fifty states and in my travels I have learned what the people of the United States are thinking about. There is one issue that stands out above all the rest, one in which every American is concerned, regardless of what group he may be a member and regardless of where he may live. And that issue, very simply stated, is this: how can we keep the peace \u2013 keep it without surrender? How can we extend freedom \u2013 extend it without war? Now in determining how we deal with this issue, we must find the answer to a very important but simple question: who threatens the peace? Who threatens freedom in the world? There is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom \u2013 that that is presented by the international Communist movement. And therefore if we are to have peace, we must know how to deal with the Communists and their leaders. I know Mr. Khrushchev. I also have had the opportunity of knowing and meeting other Communist leaders in the world. I believe there are certain principles we must find in dealing with him and his colleagues \u2013 principles, if followed, that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom. First, we have to learn from the past, because we cannot afford to make the mistakes of the past. In the seven years before this Administration came into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain. And at the end of that seven years we were engaged in a war in Korea which cost of thirty thousand American lives. In the past seven years, in President Eisenhower\u2019s Administration, this situation has been reversed. We ended the Korean War; by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars; and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table. Now why were we successful, as our predecessors were not successful? I think there\u2019re several reasons. In the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the Communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world. One of the major errors they made was the one that led to the Korean War. In ruling out the defense of Korea, they invited aggression in that area. They thought they were going to have peace \u2013 it brought war. We learned from their mistakes. And so, in our seven years, we find that we have been firm in our diplomacy; we have never made concessions without getting concessions in return. We have always been willing to go the extra mile to negotiate for disarmament or in any other area. But we have never been willing to do anything that, in effect, surrendered freedom any place in the world. That is why President Eisenhower was correct in not apologizing or expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev at the Paris Conference, as Senator Kennedy suggested he could have done. That is why Senator wh- President Eisenhower was also correct in his policy in the Formosa Straits, where he declined, and refused to follow the recommendations \u2013 recommendations which Senator Kennedy voted for in 1955; again made in 1959; again repeated in his debates that you have heard \u2013 recommendations with regard to \u2013 again \u2013 slicing off a piece of free territory, and abandoning it, if \u2013 in effect, to the Communists. Why did the President feel this was wrong and why was the President right and his critics wrong? Because again this showed a lack of understanding of dictators, a lack of understanding particularly of Communists, because every time you make such a concession it does not lead to peace; it only encourages them to blackmail you. It encourages them to begin a war. And so I say that the record shows that we know how to keep the peace, to keep it without surrender. Let us move now to the future. It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical\u2026 leaders that the world has ever seen. That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area. First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have \u2013 if the should launch a surprise attack \u2013 we will be able to destroy their war-making capability. They must know, in other words, that it is national suicide if they begin anything. We need this kind of strength because we\u2019re the guardians of the peace. In addition to military strength, we need to see that the economy of this country continues to grow. It has grown in the past seven years. It can and will grow even more in the next four. And the reason that it must grow even more is because we have things to do at home and also because we\u2019re in a race for survival \u2013 a race in which it isn\u2019t enough to be ahead; it isn\u2019t enough simply to be complacent. We have to move ahead in order to stay ahead. And that is why, in this field, I have made recommendations which I am confident will move the American economy ahead \u2013 move it firmly and soundly so that there will never be a time when the Soviet Union will be able to challenge our superiority in this field. And so we need military strength, we need economic strength, we also need the right diplomatic policies. What are they? Again we turn to the past. Firmness but no belligerence, and by no belligerence I mean that we do not answer insult by insult. When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues. And that example that President Eisenhower has set we will continue to follow. But all this by itself is not enough. It is not enough for us simply to be the strongest nation militarily, the strongest economically, and also to have firm diplomacy. We must have a great goal. And that is: not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world, to extend it to all the world because that is America\u2019s destiny. To extend it to all the world because the Communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend Communism. And you cannot fight a victory for Communism or a strategy of victory for Communism with the strategy, simply of holding the line. And so I say that we believe that our policies of military strength, of economic strength, of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep it without surrender. We also believe that in the great field of ideals that we can lead America to the victory for freedom \u2013 victory in the newly developing countries, victory also in the captive countries \u2013 provided we have faith in ourselves and faith in our principles."}

It\u2019s a tragic moment. Actually, Mr. Vice President, it\u2019s not true. I do support a national patient\u2019s bill of rights. As a matter of fact, I brought Republicans and Democrats together to do just that in the State of Texas to get a patient\u2019s bill of rights through. It requires a different kind of leadership style to do it, though. You see, in order to get something done on behalf of the people, you have to put partisanship aside, and that\u2019s what we did in my state. We have one of the most advanced patient\u2019s bill of rights. It says, for example, that a woman doesn\u2019t have to go through a gate keeper to go to her gynecologist. It says that you can\u2019t gag a doctor, doctor can advise you. The HMO, the insurance company, can\u2019t gag that doctor from giving you full advice. And this particular bill, it allows patients to choose a doctor, their own doctor if they want to. But we did something else that was interesting. We\u2019re one of the first states that said you can sue an HMO for denying you proper coverage. Now there\u2019s what\u2019s called an Independent Review Organization that you have to go through first. It says if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a complaint with your insurance company, you can take your complaint to an objective body. If the objective body rules on your behalf, the insurance company must follow those rules. However, if the insurance company doesn\u2019t follow the findings of the IRO, then that becomes a cause of action in a court of law. It\u2019s time for our nation to come together and do what\u2019s right for the people, and I think this is right for the people. You know, I support a national patient\u2019s bill of rights, Mr. Vice President, and I want all people covered. I don\u2019t want the law to supersede good law like we\u2019ve got in Texas.

I want to come back and tell you why, but if you will forgive me, I would like to say something right now at the beginning of this debate following on the moment of silence for Mel Carnahan and Randy Carnahan and Chris Sifford. Tipper and I were good friends with Mel and Randy, and I know that all of us here want to extend our sympathy and condolences to Jean and the family and to the Sifford family. And I would just like to say that this debate in a way is a living tribute to Mel Carnahan because he loved the vigorous discussion of ideas in our democracy. He was a fantastic governor of Missouri. This state became one of the top five in the nation for health care coverage for children under his leadership. One of the best in advancing all kinds of benefits for children to grow up healthy and strong. And of course, this debate also takes place at a time when the tragedy of the USS Cole is on our minds and hearts and insofar as the memorial service is tomorrow, I would like to also extend sympathy to the families of those who have died and those who are still missing, and the injured. Now, Mr. Hankins, I think that the situation that you describe has gotten completely out of hand. Doctors are giving prescriptions, they\u2019re recommending treatments, and then their recommendations are being overruled by HMOs and insurance companies. That is unacceptable. I support a strong national patient\u2019s bill of rights. It is actually a disagreement between us, a national law that is pending on this, the Dingle-Norwood bill, a bipartisan bill, is one that I support and that the governor does not."}

Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that\u2019s the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President. Now, what\u2019s at stake here is the President\u2019s made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He\u2019s been running on that, he ran on that and he\u2019s been governing on that. He\u2019s in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court. And the justice, I\u2019m not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. But she\u2019s written, before she went in the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not Constitutional. The other thing that\u2019s on the court, and if it\u2019s struck down, what happens? Women\u2019s rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. They\u2019re able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets. And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and there\u2019s a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and they\u2019ll be taken away as well.

It is breaking family budgets. I can\u2019t tell you how many people I meet who don\u2019t have health insurance. If you\u2019ve got health insurance, most of you have seen your premiums double over the last eight years. And your co-payments and deductibles have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alone. If you\u2019re a small business, it\u2019s a crushing burden. So one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing. So here\u2019s what I would do. If you\u2019ve got health care already, and probably the majority of you do, then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it. You can keep your choice of doctor. We\u2019re going to work with your employer to lower the cost of your premiums by up to $2,500 a year. And we\u2019re going to do it by investing in prevention. We\u2019re going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital. That will reduce medical errors and reduce costs. If you don\u2019t have health insurance, you\u2019re going to be able to buy the same kind of insurance that Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees. Because there\u2019s a huge pool, we can drop the costs. And nobody will be excluded for pre-existing conditions, which is a huge problem. Now, Senator McCain has a different kind of approach. He says that he\u2019s going to give you a $5,000 tax credit. What he doesn\u2019t tell you is that he is going to tax your employer-based health care benefits for the first time ever. So what one hand giveth, the other hand taketh away. He would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure you\u2019re not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered. And that is fundamentally the wrong way to go. In fact, just today business organizations like the United States Chamber of Commerce, which generally are pretty supportive of Republicans, said that this would lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system. That, I don\u2019t think, is the kind of change that we need. We\u2019ve got to have somebody who is fighting for patients and making sure that you get decent, affordable health care. And that\u2019s something that I\u2019m committed to doing as president."}

In a country as wealthy as ours, for us to have people who are going bankrupt because they can\u2019t pay their medical bills \u2014 for my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because they\u2019re saying that this may be a pre-existing condition and they don\u2019t have to pay her treatment, there\u2019s something fundamentally wrong about that. So let me \u2014 let me just talk about this fundamental difference. And, Tom, I know that we\u2019re under time constraints, but Senator McCain through a lot of stuff out there. Number one, let me just repeat, if you\u2019ve got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it. All I\u2019m going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it. You\u2019ll still have choice of doctor. There\u2019s no mandate involved. Small businesses are not going to have a mandate. What we\u2019re going to give you is a 50 percent tax credit to help provide health care for those that you need. Now, it\u2019s true that I say that you are going to have to make sure that your child has health care, because children are relatively cheap to insure and we don\u2019t want them going to the emergency room for treatable illnesses like asthma. And when Senator McCain says that he wants to provide children health care, what he doesn\u2019t mention is he voted against the expansion of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program that is responsible for making sure that so many children who didn\u2019t have previously health insurance have it now. Now, the final point I\u2019ll make on this whole issue of government intrusion and mandates \u2014 it is absolutely true that I think it is important for government to crack down on insurance companies that are cheating their customers, that don\u2019t give you the fine print, so you end up thinking that you\u2019re paying for something and, when you finally get sick and you need it, you\u2019re not getting it. And the reason that it\u2019s a problem to go shopping state by state, you know what insurance companies will do? They will find a state \u2014 maybe Arizona, maybe another state \u2014 where there are no requirements for you to get cancer screenings, where there are no requirements for you to have to get pre-existing conditions, and they will all set up shop there. That\u2019s how in banking it works. Everybody goes to Delaware, because they\u2019ve got very \u2014 pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards. And in that situation, what happens is, is that the protections you have, the consumer protections that you need, you\u2019re not going to have available to you. That is a fundamental difference that I have with Senator McCain. He believes in deregulation in every circumstance. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been going through for the last eight years. It hasn\u2019t worked, and we need fundamental change."}

He has taken the position, when he first indicated in October of last year, that he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons the president might have to stop a national emergency strike. I understand in his last speech before the Steelworkers Union, that he changed that position and indicated that he felt that government seizure might be the best way to stop a strike which could not be settled by collective bargaining. I do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure. I think the moment that you give to the union, on the one side, and to management, on the other side, the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled, that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government, and that will be a \u2013 be in the end, in my opinion, wage control; it would mean price control \u2013 all the things that we do not want. I do believe, however, that we can give to the president of the United States powers, in addition to what he presently has in the fact finding area, which would enable him to be more effective than we have been in handling these strikes. One last point I should make. The record in handling them has been very good during this Administration. We have had less man-hours lost by strikes in these last seven years than we had in the previous seven years, by a great deal. And I only want to say that however good the record is, it\u2019s got to be better. Because in this critical year \u2013 period of the sixties we\u2019ve got to move forward, all Americans must move forward together, and we have to get the greatest cooperation possible between labor and management. We cannot afford stoppages of massive effect on the economy when we\u2019re in the terrible competition we\u2019re in with the Soviets."}

This was a bipartisan idea. In fact, it was a Republican idea. And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation. And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it\u2019s the same plan. It \u2014 when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we\u2019ve created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall? Because there \u2014 there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis. One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that\u2019s been the trend line. Or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective? And there are ways of doing it. So at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average. And the reason they do is because they do some smart things. They \u2014 they say, if a patient\u2019s coming in, let\u2019s get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests. Let\u2019s make sure that we\u2019re providing preventive care so we\u2019re catching the onset of something like diabetes. Let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they\u2019ve \u2014 they\u2019ve engaged in. Now, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let\u2019s use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do. And the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we\u2019re going to be in a position to show that costs are going down. And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up \u2014 it\u2019s true \u2014 but they\u2019ve gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years. So we\u2019re already beginning to see progress. In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you\u2019re already getting a rebate. Let me make one last point. Governor Romney says, we should replace it, I\u2019m just going to repeal it, but \u2014 but we can replace it with something. But the problem is, he hasn\u2019t described what exactly we\u2019d replace it with, other than saying we\u2019re going to leave it to the states. But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he\u2019s offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there\u2019s no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who\u2019s got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance. In fact, it\u2019s estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you\u2019re looking at 50 million people losing health insurance\u2026"}

There was a lot at stake there, my friends. And I can tell you right now that Senator Obama would have brought our troops home in defeat. I\u2019ll bring them home with victory and with honor and that is a fundamental difference. The United States of America, Tom, is the greatest force for good, as I said. And we must do whatever we can to prevent genocide, whatever we can to prevent these terrible calamities that we have said never again. But it also has to be tempered with our ability to beneficially affect the situation. That requires a cool hand at the tiller. This requires a person who understands what our \u2014 the limits of our capability are. We went in to Somalia as a peacemaking organization, we ended up trying to be \u2014 excuse me, as a peacekeeping organization, we ended up trying to be peacemakers and we ended up having to withdraw in humiliation. In Lebanon, I stood up to President Reagan, my hero, and said, if we send Marines in there, how can we possibly beneficially affect this situation? And said we shouldn\u2019t. Unfortunately, almost 300 brave young Marines were killed. So you have to temper your decisions with the ability to beneficially affect the situation and realize you\u2019re sending America\u2019s most precious asset, American blood, into harm\u2019s way.

With respect to the cost, it wasn\u2019t $200 billion. You probably weren\u2019t there to vote for that. But $120 billion is, in fact, what has been allocated to Iraq. The rest of it\u2019s for Afghanistan and the global war on terror. The allies have stepped forward and agreed to reduce and forgive Iraqi debt to the tune of nearly $80 billion by one estimate. That, plus $14 billion they promised in terms of direct aid, puts the overall allied contribution financially at about $95 billion, not to the $120 billion we\u2019ve got, but, you know, better than 40 percent. So your facts are just wrong, Senator. You also have a situation where you talk about credibility. It\u2019s awfully hard to convey a sense of credibility to allies when you voted for the war and then you declared: Wrong war, wrong place, wrong time. You voted for the war, and then you voted against supporting the troops when they needed the equipment, the fuel, the spare parts and the ammunition and the body armor.

That\u2019s explicitly prohibited in the law. But let\u2019s go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions. Well, actually Governor, that isn\u2019t what your plan does. What your plan does is to duplicate what\u2019s already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can\u2019t deny you if you\u2019ve \u2014 if it\u2019s been under 90 days. But that\u2019s already the law and that doesn\u2019t help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions. There\u2019s a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts. It wasn\u2019t a government takeover of health care. It was the largest expansion of private insurance. But what it does say is that \u201cinsurers, you\u2019ve got to take everybody.\u201d Now, that also means that you\u2019ve got more customers. But when \u2014 when Governor Romney says that he\u2019ll replace it with something, but can\u2019t detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isn\u2019t a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem. It just reminds me of, you know, he says that he\u2019s going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan. That\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be paid for, but we don\u2019t know the details. He says that he\u2019s going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don\u2019t know exactly which ones. He won\u2019t tell us. He now says he\u2019s going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don\u2019t have to worry. And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they\u2019re too good? Is it \u2014 is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them? No. The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we\u2019ve got to make choices. And the choices we\u2019ve made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country."}

But when the president of the United States is doing something that\u2019s right, something that is for the purpose of defending the security of this country against surprise attack, he can never express regrets or apologize to anybody, including Mr. Khrushchev. Now in that connection Senator Kennedy has criticized the President on the ground not only of not expressing regrets, but because he allowed this flight to take place while the summit conference \u2013 or immediately before the summit conference occurred. This seems to me is criticism that again is wrong on his part. We all remember Pearl Harbor. We lost three thousand American lives. We cannot afford an intelligence gap.

I never suggested that compulsory arbitration was the solution for national emergency disputes. I\u2019m opposed to that, was opposed to it in October, 1958. I have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act. I don\u2019t know what other weapons the Vice President is talking about. I\u2019m talking about giving him four or five tools \u2013 not only the fact-finding committee that he now has under the injunction provision, not only the injunction, but also the power of the fact-finding commission to make recommendations \u2013 recommendations which would not be binding, but nevertheless would have great force of public opinion behind them. One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure. There might be others. By the president having five powers \u2013 four or five powers \u2013 and he only has very limited powers today, neither the company nor the union would be sure which power would be used; and therefore, there would be a greater incentive on both sides to reach an agreement themselves without taking it to the government. The difficulty now is the president\u2019s course is quite limited. He can set up a fact-finding committee. The fact-finding committee\u2019s powers are limited. He can provide an injunction if there\u2019s a national emergency for eighty days, then the strike can go on; and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the Congress. This is a difficult and sensitive matter. But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do. He could leave the parties in doubt as to which one he would use; and therefore there would be incentive, instead of as now \u2013 the steel companies were ready to take the strike because they felt the injunction of eighty days would break the union, which didn\u2019t happen."}

I think that Senator Kennedy\u2019s policies and recommendations for the handling of the Castro regime are probably the most dangers- dangerously irresponsible recommendations that he\u2019s made during the course of this campaign. In effect, what Senator Kennedy recommends is that the United States government should give help to the exiles and to those within Cuba who oppose the Castro regime \u2013 provided they are anti-Batista. Now let\u2019s just see what this means. We have five treaties with Latin America, including the one setting up the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948, in which we have agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of any other American country \u2013 and they as well have agreed to do likewise. The charter of the United Nations \u2013 its Preamble, Article I and Article II \u2013 also provide that there shall be no intervention by one nation in the internal affairs of another. Now I don\u2019t know what Senator Kennedy suggests when he says that we should help those who oppose the Castro regime, both in Cuba and without. But I do know this: that if we were to follow that recommendation, that we would lose all of our friends in Latin America, we would probably be condemned in the United Nations, and we would not accomplish our objective. I know something else. It would be an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to come in, to come into Latin America and to engage us in what would be a civil war, and possibly even worse than that. This is the major recommendation that he\u2019s made. Now, what can we do? Well, we can do what we did with Guatemala. There was a Communist dictator that we inherited from the previous Administration. We quarantined Mr. Arbenz. The result was that the Guatemalan people themselves eventually rose up and they threw him out. We are quarantining Mr. Castro today. We\u2019re quarantining him diplomatically by bringing back our Ambassador; economically by cutting off trade, and Senator Kennedy\u2019s suggestion that the trade that we cut off is not significant is just one hundred percent wrong. We are cutting off the significant items that the Cuban regime needs in order to survive. By cutting off trade, by cutting off our diplomatic relations as we have, we will quarantine this regime so that the people of Cuba themselves will take care of Mr. Castro. But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want."}

First of all, Joe Biden and I are both people of faith. And it\u2019s insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith, and in fact, Joe if elected will be only the second practicing Catholic, as President of the United States. On the issue of this nomination \u2013 Joe and I are very clear, as are the majority of the American people. We are 27 days before the decision about who will be the next president of the United States. And you know before, when this conversation has come up, you know it\u2019s been about election year or election time. We\u2019re literally in an election. Over 4 million people have voted. People are in the process of voting right now. And so Joe has been very clear, as the American people are: Let the American people fill that seat in the White House, and then we\u2019ll fill that seat on the United States Supreme Court. And to your point, Susan, the issues before us couldn\u2019t be more serious. There\u2019s the issue of choice, and I will always fight for a woman\u2019s right to make a decision about her own body. It should be her decision and not that of Donald Trump, and the Vice President, Michael Pence. But let\u2019s also look at what else is before the court. It\u2019s the Affordable Care Act. Like, literally in the midst of a public health pandemic \u2013 when over 210,000 people have died and 7 million people probably have what will be in the future considered a pre-existing condition because you contracted the virus \u2013 Donald Trump is in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I\u2019ve said it before and it bears repeating: This means that there will be no more protections, if they win, for people with pre-existing conditions. This means that over 20 million people will lose your coverage. It means that if you\u2019re under the age of 26, you can\u2019t stay on your parents coverage anymore. And here\u2019s the thing. The contrast couldn\u2019t be more clear. They\u2019re trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Joe Biden is saying let\u2019s expand coverage, let\u2019s give you a choice of a public option or private coverage, let\u2019s bring down premiums, let\u2019s lower Medicare eligibility to 60. That\u2019s true leadership."}

And the answer is neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare. So if you\u2019re 60 or around 60 or older, you don\u2019t need to listen any further. But for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring. Oh, I just thought about one. And that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the president isn\u2019t proposing any changes for current retirees. In fact he is on Medicare. On Social Security he\u2019s not. But on Medicare, for current retirees, he\u2019s cutting $716 billion from the program. Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers. Actually just going to them and saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody\u2019s going to get a lower rate.\u201d That\u2019s not just going after places where there\u2019s abuse. That\u2019s saying we\u2019re cutting the rates. Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won\u2019t take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario. We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won\u2019t take more Medicare patients. This \u2014 we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts. I can\u2019t understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare. Now, you point out, well, we\u2019re putting some back. We\u2019re going to give a better prescription program. That\u2019s $1 \u2014 that\u2019s $1 for every $15 you\u2019ve cut. They\u2019re smart enough to know that\u2019s not a good trade. I want to take that $716 billion you\u2019ve cut and put it back into Medicare. By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it. But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake. And with regards to young people coming along, I\u2019ve got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question."}

What I do is the same way that Tip O\u2019Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago. When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster. He said he was going to lower tax rates. He said he was going to broaden the base. You\u2019ve said the same thing, you\u2019re going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base. Those are my principles. I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families. And I\u2019m going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what \u2014 what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance? One way, for instance, would be to have a single number. Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000. Anybody can have deductions up to that amount. And then that number disappears for high-income people. That\u2019s one way one could do it. One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way. There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth. And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre-existing condition plan. You obviously studied up on \u2014 on my plan. In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions. That\u2019s part of my health care plan. And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state. And I said that at that time. The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy."}

Look, as I travel around the country, this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again. Just yesterday, I was in Toledo shaking some hands in a line. Two women, both of them probably in their mid- to late-50s, had just been laid off of their plant. Neither of them have health insurance. And they were desperate for some way of getting coverage, because, understandably, they\u2019re worried that, if they get sick, they could go bankrupt. So here\u2019s what my plan does. If you have health insurance, then you don\u2019t have to do anything. If you\u2019ve got health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan. The only thing we\u2019re going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you. And we estimate we can cut the average family\u2019s premium by about $2,500 per year. If you don\u2019t have health insurance, then what we\u2019re going to do is to provide you the option of buying into the same kind of federal pool that both Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees, which will give you high-quality care, choice of doctors, at lower costs, because so many people are part of this insured group. We\u2019re going to make sure that insurance companies can\u2019t discriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions. We\u2019ll negotiate with the drug companies for the cheapest available price on drugs. We are going to invest in information technology to eliminate bureaucracy and make the system more efficient. And we are going to make sure that we manage chronic illnesses, like diabetes and heart disease, that cost a huge amount, but could be prevented. We\u2019ve got to put more money into preventive care. This will cost some money on the front end, but over the long term this is the only way that not only are we going to make families healthy, but it\u2019s also how we\u2019re going to save the federal budget, because we can\u2019t afford these escalating costs."}

My concerns about the senator is that, in the course of this campaign, I\u2019ve been listening very carefully to what he says, and he changes positions on the war in Iraq. He changes positions on something as fundamental as what you believe in your core, in your heart of hearts, is right in Iraq. You cannot lead if you send mixed messages.

So let me try to answer you in this way. Let\u2019s start with a premise. We spend 30% more of our income than any nation on earth on health care, and yet we insure fewer people. We have 35 million people without any insurance at all \u2014 and I see them all the time. A hundred thousand Americans a month have lost their health insurance just in the last 4 years. So if you analyze where we\u2019re out of line with other countries, you come up with the following conclusions. Number one, we spend at least $60 billion a year on insurance, administrative cost, bureaucracy, and government regulation that wouldn\u2019t be spent in any other nation. So we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everybody. Employers would cover their employees, government would cover the unemployed. Number 2, I think you have to take on specifically the insurance companies and require them to make some significant change in the way they rate people in the big community pools. I think you have to tell the pharmaceutical companies they can\u2019t keep raising drug prices at three times the rate of inflation. I think you have to take on medical fraud. I think you have to help doctors stop practicing defensive medicine. I\u2019ve recommended that our doctors be given a set of national practice guidelines and that if they follow those guidelines that raises the presumption that they didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I think you have to have a system of primary and preventive clinics in our inner cities and our rural areas so people can have access to health care. The key is to control the cost and maintain the quality. To do that you need a system of managed competition where all of us are covered in big groups and we can choose our doctors and our hospitals, a wide range, but there is an incentive to control costs. And I think there has to be \u2014 I think Mr. Perot and I agree on this, there has to be a national commission of health care providers and health care consumers that set ceilings to keep health costs in line with inflation, plus population growth. Now, let me say, some people say we can\u2019t do this but Hawaii does it. They cover 98% of their people and their insurance premiums are much cheaper than the rest of America, and so does Rochester, New York. They now have a plan to cover everybody and their premiums are two-thirds of the rest of the country. This is very important. It\u2019s a big human problem and a devastating economic problem for America, and I\u2019m going to send a plan to do this within the first 100 days of my presidency. It\u2019s terribly important."}

I think we have to make progress first in the field of employment. And there we would give statutory authority to the Committee on Government Contracts, which is an effective way of getting real progress made in this area, since about one out of every four jobs is held by and is allotted by people who have government contracts. Certainly I think all of us agree that when anybody has a government contract, certainly the money that is spent under that contract ought to be disbursed equally without regard to the race or creed or color of the individual who is to be employed. Second, in the field of schools, we believe that there should be provisions whereby the federal government would give assistance to those districts who do want to integrate their schools. That of course was rejected as was the government contracts provision by the special session of the Congress to \u2013 in which Mr. Kennedy was quite active. And then as far as other areas are concerned, I think that we have to look to presidential leadership. And when I speak of presidential leadership, I refer for example to our attitude on the sit-in strikes. Here we have a situation which causes all of us concern \u2013 causes us concern because of the denial of the rights of people to the equality which we think belongs to everybody. I have talked to Negro mothers. I\u2019ve heard them explain \u2013 try to explain \u2013 how they tell their children how they can go into a store and buy a loaf of bread but then can\u2019t go into that store and sit at the counter and get a Coca Cola. This is wrong, and we have to do something about it. So, under the circumstances, what do we do? Well what we do is what the Attorney-General of the United States did under the direction of the President: call in the owners of chain stores and get them to take action. Now there are other places where the executive can lead, but let me just sum up by saying this: why do I talk every time I\u2019m in the South on civil rights? Not because I am preaching to the people of the South because this isn\u2019t just a Southern problem; it\u2019s a Northern problem and a Western problem; it\u2019s a problem for all of us. I do it because it\u2019s the responsibility of leadership, I do it because we have to solve this problem together. I do it right at this time particularly because when we have Khrushchev in this country \u2013 a man who has enslaved millions, a man who has slaughtered thousands \u2013 we cannot continue to have a situation where he can point the finger at the United States of America and say that we are denying rights to our citizens. And so I say both the candidates and both the vice presidential candidates, I would hope as well \u2013 including Senator Johnson \u2013 should talk on this issue at every opportunity."}

And as I pointed out in 1952, I made it very clear that as far as the Korean War was concerned, that I felt that the decision to go into the war in Korea was right and necessary. What I criticized were the policies that made it necessary to go to Korea. Now incidentally, I should point out here that Senator Kennedy has attacked our foreign policy. He\u2019s said that it\u2019s been a policy that has led to defeat and retreat. And I\u2019d like to know where have we been defeated and where have we retreated? In the Truman Administration, six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain including the satellite countries of Eastern Europe and Communist China. In this Administration we\u2019ve stopped them at Quemoy and Matsu; we\u2019ve stopped them in Indochina; we\u2019ve stopped them in Lebanon; we\u2019ve stopped them in other parts of the world. I would also like to point out that as far as Senator Kennedy\u2019s comments are concerned, I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks we\u2019re wrong. But he has a responsibility to be accurate, and not to misstate the case. I don\u2019t think he should say that our prestige is at an all-time low. I think this is very harmful at a time Mr. Khrushchev is here \u2013 harmful because it\u2019s wrong. I don\u2019t think it was helpful when he suggested \u2013 and I\u2019m glad he\u2019s corrected this to an extent \u2013 that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night in the United States. Now this just wasn\u2019t true. Now, there are people who go to bed hungry in the United States \u2013 far less, incidentally, than used to go to bed hungry when we came into power at the end of the Truman Administration. But the thing that is right about the United States, it should be emphasized, is that less people go to bed hungry in the United States than in any major country in the world. We\u2019re the best fed; we\u2019re the best clothed, with a better distribution of this world\u2019s goods to all of our people than any people in history. Now, in pointing out the things that are wrong, I think we ought to emphasize America\u2019s strengths. It isn\u2019t necessary to \u2013 to run America down in order to build her up. Now so that we get it absolutely clear: Senator Kennedy must as a candidate \u2013 as I as a candidate in fifty-two \u2013 criticize us when we\u2019re wrong. And he\u2019s doing a very effective job of that, in his way. But on the other hand, he has a responsibility to be accurate. And I have a responsibility to correct him every time he misstates the case; and I intend to continue to do so."}

Now, in this connection I want to point out that the facts simply aren\u2019t as stated. First of all, the report to which Senator Kennedy refers is one that was made many, many months ago and related particularly to the uh \u2013 period immediately after Sputnik. Second, as far as this report is concerned, I would have no objection to having it made public. Third, I would say this with regard to this report, with regard to Gallup Polls of prestige abroad and everything else that we\u2019ve been hearing about \u201cwhat about American prestige abroad\u201d: America\u2019s prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for America allow it to be. Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example \u2013 Senator Kennedy \u2013 stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight \u2013 we\u2019ve had twenty-eight successful shots, they\u2019ve had eight; when he states that we\u2019re second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I\u2019ve seen ours, and we\u2019re not; that we\u2019re second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we\u2019re way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige? Well, it can only have the effect certainly of reducing it. Well let me make one thing clear. Senator Kennedy has a responsibility to criticize those things that are wrong, but he has also a responsibility to be right in his criticism. Every one of these items that I have mentioned he\u2019s been wrong \u2013 dead wrong. And for that reason he has contributed to any lack of prestige. Finally, let me say this: as far as prestige is concerned, the first place it would show up would be in the United Nations. Now Senator Kennedy has referred to the vote on Communist China. Let\u2019s look at the vote on Hungary. There we got more votes for condemning Hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year. Let\u2019s look at the reaction eh \u2013 reaction to Khrushchev and Eisenhower at the last U.N. session. Did Khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted? Not at all. The President gained. America gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it\u2019s that that keeps the prestige of America up, not running down America the way Senator Kennedy has been running her down."}

But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan. Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan. That\u2019s already offered in the private marketplace. You don\u2019t have to have the government mandate that for that to occur. But let\u2019s come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it\u2019s more affordable for families. And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have. In my opinion, the government is not effective in \u2014 in bringing down the cost of almost anything. As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be. Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe. This is the private market. These are small \u2014 these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs. I used to consult to businesses \u2014 excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers. I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people. In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don\u2019t need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have. We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that\u2019s happening. Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others. But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have. That\u2019s the wrong way to go. The private market and individual responsibility always work best."}

But understand, that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war.

Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state. But let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing Iran and all that, let me tell you my record. Back in 1983, when I was a brand-new United States congressman, the one \u2014 the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon. And I saw that, and I saw the situation, and I stood up, and I voted against that, because I was afraid that they couldn\u2019t make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference. Tragically, I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks. And then we had Somalia \u2014 then we had the first Gulf War. I supported \u2014 I supported that. I supported us going into Bosnia, when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in Bosnia. That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe. I supported what we did in Kosovo. I supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there. And I have a record \u2014 and Somalia, I opposed that we should turn \u2014 turn the force in Somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of. So I have a record. I have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harm\u2019s way. And I\u2019ll tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, \u201cSenator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son\u2019s name on it.\u201d He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad, Matthew Stanley, before Christmas last year. This was last August, a year ago. And I said, \u201cI will \u2014 I will wear his bracelet with honor.\u201d And this was August, a year ago. And then she said, \u201cBut, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything \u2014 promise me one thing, that you\u2019ll do everything in your power to make sure that my son\u2019s death was not in vain.\u201d That means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re-enlisted in Baghdad, just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed. And they all say to me that we don\u2019t want defeat. I know what that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like when an army is defeated. A war that I was in, where we had an Army, that it wasn\u2019t through any fault of their own, but they were defeated. And I know how hard it is for that \u2014 for an Army and a military to recover from that. And it did and we will win this one and we won\u2019t come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail."}

I believe that part of the reason we have a difficult situation is because we made a bad judgment going into Iraq in the first place when we hadn\u2019t finished the job of hunting down bin Laden and crushing al Qaeda. So what happened was we got distracted, we diverted resources, and ultimately bin Laden escaped, set up base camps in the mountains of Pakistan in the northwest provinces there. They are now raiding our troops in Afghanistan, destabilizing the situation. They\u2019re stronger now than at any time since 2001. And that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s so important for us to reverse course, because that\u2019s the central front on terrorism. They are plotting to kill Americans right now. As Secretary Gates, the defense secretary, said, the war against terrorism began in that region and that\u2019s where it will end. So part of the reason I think it\u2019s so important for us to end the war in Iraq is to be able to get more troops into Afghanistan, put more pressure on the Afghan government to do what it needs to do, eliminate some of the drug trafficking that\u2019s funding terrorism. But I do believe that we have to change our policies with Pakistan. We can\u2019t coddle, as we did, a dictator, give him billions of dollars and then he\u2019s making peace treaties with the Taliban and militants. What I\u2019ve said is we\u2019re going to encourage democracy in Pakistan, expand our nonmilitary aid to Pakistan so that they have more of a stake in working with us, but insisting that they go after these militants. And if we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then I think that we have to act and we will take them out. We will kill bin Laden; we will crush Al Qaida. That has to be our biggest national security priority."}

When you announce that you\u2019re going to launch an attack into another country, it\u2019s pretty obvious that you have the effect that it had in Pakistan: It turns public opinion against us. Now, let me just go back with you very briefly. We drove the Russians out with \u2014 the Afghan freedom fighters drove the Russians out of Afghanistan, and then we made a most serious mistake. We washed our hands of Afghanistan. The Taliban came back in, Al Qaida, we then had the situation that required us to conduct the Afghan war. Now, our relations with Pakistan are critical, because the border areas are being used as safe havens by the Taliban and Al Qaida and other extremist organizations, and we have to get their support. Now, General Petraeus had a strategy, the same strategy \u2014 very, very different, because of the conditions and the situation \u2014 but the same fundamental strategy that succeeded in Iraq.

And I\u2019ve had conversations with him. It is the same overall strategy. Of course, we have to do some things tactically, some of which Senator Obama is correct on. We have to double the size of the Afghan army. We have to have a streamlined NATO command structure. We have to do a lot of things. We have to work much more closely with the Pakistanis. But most importantly, we have to have the same strategy, which Senator Obama said wouldn\u2019t work, couldn\u2019t work, still fails to admit that he was wrong about Iraq. He still will not admit that he was wrong about the strategy of the surge in Iraq, and that\u2019s the same kind of strategy of go out and secure and hold and allow people to live normal lives. And once they feel secure, then they lead normal, social, economic, political lives, the same thing that\u2019s happening in Iraq today. So I have confidence that General Petraeus, working with the Pakistanis, working with the Afghans, doing the same job that he did in Iraq, will again. We will succeed and we will bring our troops home with honor and victory and not in defeat."}

He came to see me. And he talked about how optimistic he was and the country was about heading toward elections. Think about it - They\u2019re going from tyranny to elections. He talked about the reconstruction efforts that are beginning to take hold. He talked about the fact that Iraqis love to be free. He said he was optimistic when he came here, then he turned on the TV and listened to the political rhetoric and all of a sudden he was pessimistic. Now, this is guy a who, along with others, has taken great risk for great freedom. And we need to stand with him. My opponent says he has a plan; it sounds familiar, because it\u2019s called the Bush plan. We\u2019re going to train troops, and we are. We\u2019ll have 125,000 trained by the end of December. We\u2019re spending about $7 billion. He talks about a grand idea - Let\u2019s have a summit; we\u2019re going to solve the problem in Iraq by holding a summit. And what is he going to say to those people that show up at the summit? Join me in the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place. Risk your troops in a war you\u2019ve called a mistake. Nobody is going to follow somebody who doesn\u2019t believe we can succeed and with somebody who says that war where we are is a mistake. I know how these people think. I meet with them all the time. I talk to Tony Blair all the time. I talk to Silvio Berlusconi. They\u2019re not going to follow an American president who says follow me into a mistake. Our plan is working. We\u2019re going to make elections. And Iraq is going to be free, and America will be better off for it."}

Listen, we\u2019ll do everything we can to protect the homeland. My opponent\u2019s right, we need good intelligence. It\u2019s also a curious thing for him to say since right after 1993 he voted to cut the intelligence budget by $7.5 billion. The best way to defend America in this world we live in is to stay on the offense. We got to be right 100 percent of the time here at home, and they got to be right once. And that\u2019s the reality. And there\u2019s a lot of good people working hard. We\u2019re doing the best we possibly can to share information. That\u2019s why the Patriot Act was important. The Patriot Act is vital, by the way. It\u2019s a tool that law enforcement now uses to be able to talk between each other. My opponent says he hadn\u2019t changed his position on it. No, but he\u2019s for weakening it. I don\u2019t think my opponent has got the right view about the world to make us safe; I really don\u2019t. First of all, I don\u2019t think he can succeed in Iraq. And if Iraq were to fail, it\u2019d be a haven for terrorists, and there would be money and the world would be much more dangerous. I don\u2019t see how you can win in Iraq if you don\u2019t believe we should be there in the first place. I don\u2019t see how you can lead troops if you say it\u2019s the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time. I don\u2019t see how the Iraqis are going to have confidence in the American president if all they hear is that it was a mistake to be there in the first place. This war is a long, long war, and it requires steadfast determination and it requires a complete understanding that we not only chase down Al Qaida but we disrupt terrorist safe havens as well as people who could provide the terrorists with support."}

I have not suggested there\u2019s a connection between Iraq and 9\/11, but there\u2019s clearly an established Iraqi track record with terror. And the point is that that\u2019s the place where you\u2019re most likely to see the terrorists come together with weapons of mass destruction, the deadly technologies that Saddam Hussein had developed and used over the years. Now, the fact of the matter is, the big difference here, Gwen, is they are not prepared to deal with states that sponsor terror. They\u2019ve got a very limited view about how to use U.S. military forces to defend America. We heard Senator Kerry say the other night that there ought to be some kind of global test before U.S. troops are deployed preemptively to protect the United States. That\u2019s part of a track record that goes back to the 1970s when he ran for Congress the first time and said troops should not be deployed without U.N. approval. Then, in the mid-\u201980s, he ran on the basis of cutting most of our major defense programs. In 1991, he voted against Desert Storm. It\u2019s a consistent pattern over time of always being on the wrong side of defense issues. A little tough talk in the midst of a campaign or as part of a presidential debate cannot obscure a record of 30 years of being on the wrong side of defense issues. And they give absolutely no indication, based on that record, of being wiling to go forward and aggressively pursue the war on terror with a kind of strategy that will work, that will defeat our enemies and will guarantee that the United States doesn\u2019t again get attacked by the likes of Al Qaida."}

We\u2019ve actively and aggressively pursued him. We\u2019ve captured or killed thousands of Al Qaida in various places around the world and especially in Afghanistan. We\u2019ll continue to very aggressively pursue him, and I\u2019m confident eventually we\u2019ll get him. The key to success in Afghanistan has been, again, to go in and go after the terrorists, which we\u2019ve done, and also take down the Taliban regime which allowed them to function there, in effect sponsors, if you will, of the Al Qaida organization. John Edwards, two and a half years ago, six months after we went into Afghanistan announced that it was chaotic, the situation was deteriorating, the warlords were about to take over. Here we are, two and a half years later, we\u2019re four days away from a democratic election, the first one in history in Afghanistan. We\u2019ve got 10 million voters who have registered to vote, nearly half of them women. That election will put in place a democratically elected government that will take over next December. We\u2019ve made enormous progress in Afghanistan, in exactly the right direction, in spite of what John Edwards said two and a half years ago. He just got it wrong. The fact is, as we go forward in Afghanistan, we will pursue Osama bin Laden and the terrorists as long as necessary. We\u2019re standing up Afghan security forces so they can take on responsibility for their own security. We\u2019ll keep U.S. forces there \u2014 we have about 16,000 there today \u2014 as long as necessary, to assist the Afghans in terms of dealing with their security situation. But they\u2019re making significant progress. We have President Karzai, who is in power. They have done wonders writing their own constitution for the first time ever. Schools are open. Young girls are going to school. Women are going to vote. Women are even eligible to run for office. This is major, major progress. There will be democracy in Afghanistan, make no doubt about it. Freedom is the best antidote to terror."}

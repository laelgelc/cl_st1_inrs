I\u2019d like to start by telling you what my vision is. I see a day in the United States of America where all of our public schools are considered excellent, world class. Where there are no failing schools, where the classrooms are small enough in size, number of students, so that the teacher can spend enough one-on-one time with each student. Now that means recruiting new teachers for the public schools. It means in my plan hiring bonuses to get 100,000 new teachers in the public schools within the next four years. It means also helping local school districts that sometimes find the parents of school age children outvoted on bond issues, to give them some help with interest-free bonding authority so that we can build new schools and modernize the classrooms. We need to give teachers the training and professional development that they need, including a paid time off to go visit the classroom of a master teacher to pick up some new skills. I want to give every middle-class family a $10,000 a year tax deduction for college tuition so that middle-class families will always be able to send their kids on to college. I want to work for universal free school because we know from all the studies that the youngsters learn, kids learn more in the first few years of life than any where else. Now, I said there was a contrast. Governor Bush is for vouchers, and in his plan he proposes to drain more money, more taxpayer money out of the public schools for private school vouchers than all of the money that he proposes in his entire budget for public schools themselves. And only one in 20 students would be eligible for these vouchers, and they wouldn\u2019t even pay the full tuition to private school. I think that\u2019s a mistake. I don\u2019t think we should give up on the private schools and leave kids trapped in failing schools. I think we \u2014 I think we should make it the number one priority to make our schools the best in the world, all of them."}

I think the governor may not have heard what I said clearly. The voluntary national testing is in addition to the mandatory testing that we require of states. All schools, all school districts, students themselves, and required teacher testing, which goes a step farther than Governor Bush has been willing to go. Here are a couple of differences, though, Jim. Governor Bush is in favor of vouchers which take taxpayer money away from public schools and give them to private schools that are not accountable for how the money is used and don\u2019t have to take all applicants. Now, private schools play a great role in our society. All of our children have gone to both public schools and private schools. But I don\u2019t think private schools should have a right to take taxpayer money away from public schools at a time when Caley Ellis is standing in that classroom. Let me give you another example. I went to a school in Dade County, Florida where the facilities are so overcrowded the children have to eat lunch in shifts with the first shift for lunch starting at 9:30 in the morning. Look, this is a funding crisis all around the country. There are fewer parents of school-age children as a percentage of the voting population and there is the largest generation of students ever. We\u2019re in an information age when learning is more important than ever. 90% of our kids go to public schools. We have to make it the number one priority. Modernize our schools, reduce class size, recruit new teachers, give every child a chance to learn with one-on-one time in a quality \u2014 high-quality, safe school. If it\u2019s a failing school, shut it down and reopen it under a new principal with a turnaround team of specialists the way Governor Jim Hunt does in North Carolina. Here is another difference. The governor, if it\u2019s a failing school, would leave the children in that failing school for three years and then give a little bit of money to the parents, a down payment on a down payment for private school tuition, and pretend that that would be enough for them to go out and go to a private school. It\u2019s an illusion."}

This race is about values, it\u2019s about change, it\u2019s about giving choices to the American people. And education is my number one priority, because I think that it\u2019s the most important big major change that we can bring in our country. I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students. I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also. The difference is that while my plan starts with new accountability and maintains local control, it doesn\u2019t stop there. Because I want to give new choices to parents. To send their kids to college with a $10,000 tax deduction for college tuition per child per year. I want to reduce the size of the classrooms in this country. For one basic reason, so that students can get more one-on-one time with teachers. And the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers. I\u2019ve a plan in my budget to recruit 100,000 new, highly qualified teachers and to help local school districts build new schools. I think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and pre-school. Now, here is how that connects with all the rest of what we\u2019ve been talking about. If you have \u2014 if you squander the surplus on a huge tax cut that goes mostly to those at the top, then you can\u2019t make education the top priority. If the tax cut is your number one, two, three and four priority, you can\u2019t do education. You can\u2019t do both. You have to choose. I choose education and health care, the environment and retirement security, and I ask for your support."}

I mentioned before that the local communities are having a harder time passing bond issues. Traditionally, if you\u2019ve been involved in a campaign like that, you know that the parents with kids in school are the ones that turn out and vote. It\u2019s ironic that there are now \u2014 there is now a smaller percentage of the voters made up of parents with children than ever in American history because of the aging of our population, but at the same time we\u2019ve got the largest generation of students in public schools ever. More than 90% of America\u2019s children go to public schools. And it\u2019s the largest number ever this year and they\u2019ll break the record next year and every year for ten years running. We\u2019ve got to do something about this. And local \u2014 it\u2019s not enough to leave it up to the local school districts. They\u2019re not able to do it and our future depends upon it. Look, we\u2019re in an information age. Our economic future depends upon whether or not our children are going to get the kind of education that lets them go on to college. And again, I want to make it possible for all middle-class families to send their kids to college and more Pell grants for those who are in the lower income groups also, and then I want to make sure that we have job training on top of that and lifelong learning, but it all starts with the public school teachers. My proposal gives $10,000 hiring bonuses for those teachers who are \u2014 who get certified to teach in the areas where they\u2019re most needed. Now, accountability, we basically agree on accountability. My plan requires testing of all students. It also requires something that Governor Bush\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t. It requires testing of all new teachers, including in the subjects that they teach. We have to start treating teachers like the professionals that they are, and give them the respect and the kind of quality of life that will draw more people into teaching because we need a lot more teachers."}

But I do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do. Now we tried to do this under President Bush. He put forward No Child Left Behind. Unfortunately, they left the money behind for No Child Left Behind. And local school districts end up having more of a burden, a bunch of unfunded mandates, the same kind of thing that happened with special education where we did the right thing by saying every school should provide education to kids with special needs, but we never followed through on the promise of funding, and that left local school districts very cash-strapped. So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support. Senator McCain and I actually agree on two things that he just mentioned. Charter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions. I think it\u2019s important to foster competition inside the public schools. And we also agree on the need for making sure that if we have bad teachers that they are swiftly \u2014 after given an opportunity to prove themselves, if they can\u2019t hack it, then we need to move on because our kids have to have their best future. Where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers \u2014 give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system. And I also have to disagree on Senator McCain\u2019s record when it comes to college accessibility and affordability. Recently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didn\u2019t seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was, well, you know, we can\u2019t give money to every interest group that comes along. I don\u2019t think America\u2019s youth are interest groups, I think they\u2019re our future. And this is an example of where we are going to have to prioritize. We can\u2019t say we\u2019re going to do things and then not explain in concrete terms how we\u2019re going to pay for it. And if we\u2019re going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it. It\u2019s not going to happen on its own."}

I strongly support new accountability, so does Governor Bush. I strongly support local control, so does Governor Bush. I\u2019m in favor of testing as a way of measuring performance. Every school and every school district, have every state test the children. I\u2019ve also proposed a voluntary national test in the fourth grade and eighth grade, and a form of testing the governor has not endorsed. I think that all new teachers ought to be tested in the subjects that they teach. We\u2019ve got to recruit 100,000 new teachers. And I have budgeted for that. We\u2019ve got to reduce the class size so that the student who walks in has more one-on-one time with the teacher. We ought to have universal pre-school and we ought to make college tuition tax deductible, up to $10,000 a year. I would like to tell you a quick story. I got a letter today as I left Sarasota, Florida. I\u2019m here with a group of 13 people from around the country who helped me prepare. We had a great time. Two days ago we ate lunch at a restaurant. The guy that served us lunch gave me a letter today. His name is Randy Ellis. He has a 15-year-old daughter named Caley, who is in Sarasota High School. Her science class was supposed to be for 24 students. She\u2019s the 36th student in that classroom. They sent me a picture of her in the classroom. They can\u2019t squeeze another desk in for her, so she has to stand during class.

And the first word you need to say in every city and state, and just draw a line in the sand, is public schools exist for the benefit of the children. You\u2019re going to see a lot of people fall over it, because any time you\u2019re spending $199 billion dollars a year, somebody\u2019s getting it. And the children get lost in the process. So that\u2019s step one. Keep in mind in 1960, when our schools were the envy of the world, we were spending $16 billion on them; now we spend more than any other nation in the world \u2014 199 billion a year \u2014 and rank at the bottom of the industrialized world in terms of education achievement. One more time you\u2019ve bought a front-row box seat and got a third-rate performance. This is a government that is not serving you. By and large it should be local \u2014 the more local, the better. Interesting phenomenon: small towns have good schools, big cities have terrible schools. The best people in a small town will serve on the school board; you get into big cities, it\u2019s political patronage, stepping stones \u2014 you get the job, give your relatives a janitor\u2019s job at $57,000 a year, more than the teachers make, and with luck they clean the cafeteria once a week. Now, you\u2019re paying for that. Those schools belong to you. And we put up with that. Now, as long as we put up with that, that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to get. And these folks are just dividing up 199 billion bucks and the children get lost. If I could wish for one thing for great public schools, it would be a strong family unit in every home \u2014 nothing will ever replace that. You say, well, gee, what are you going to do about that? Well, the White House is a bully pulpit, and I think we ought to be pounding on the table every day. There\u2019s nothing \u2014 the most efficient unit of government the world will ever know is a strong loving family unit. Next thing. You need small schools, not big schools. In a little school everybody is somebody; individualism is very important. These big factories? Everybody told me they were cost-effective. I did a study on it; they\u2019re cost- ineffective. 5000 students \u2014 why is a high school that big? One reason. Sooner or later you get 11 more boys that can run like the devil that weigh 250 pounds and they might win district. Now, that has nothing to do with learning. Secondly, across Texas, typically half of the school day was non-academic pursuits \u2014 in one place it was 35%. In Texas you could have unlimited absences to go to livestock shows. Found a boy \u2014 excuse me, but this gives the flavor \u2014 a boy in Houston kept a chicken in the bathtub in downtown Houston and missed 65 days going to livestock shows. Finally had to come back to school, the chicken lost its feathers. That\u2019s the only way we got him back. (Laughter) Now, that\u2019s your tax money being wasted. Now, neighborhood schools. It is terrible to bus tiny little children across town. And it is particularly terrible to take poor tiny little children and wait until the first grade and bus them across town to Mars, where the children know their numbers, know their letters, have had every advantage. At the end of the first day, that little child wants out. I\u2019ll close on this. You\u2019ve got to have world class teachers, world class books. If you ever got close to how textbooks were selected, you wouldn\u2019t want to go back the second day. I don\u2019t have time to tell you the stories."}

Seventy percent of my state\u2019s money goes to the public schools, and I was really honored when Time magazine said that our schools have shown more improvement than any other state in the country except one other \u2014 they named 2 states showing real strides forward in the 80s. So I care a lot about this, and I\u2019ve spent countless hours in schools. But let me start with what you said. I agree with some of what Mr. Bush said, but it\u2019s nowhere near enough. We live in a world where what you earn depends on what you can learn, where the average 18- year-old will change jobs 8 times in a lifetime and where none of us can promise any of you that what you now do for a living is absolutely safe from now on. Nobody running can promise that, there\u2019s too much change in the world. So what should we do? Let me reel some things off real quick, because you said you wanted specifics. Number one, under my program we would provide matching funds to states to teach everybody with a job to read in the next 5 years and give everybody with a job the chance to get a high school diploma, in big places on the job. Number 2, we would provide 2-year apprenticeship programs to high school graduates who don\u2019t go to college. And community colleges are on the job. Number three, we\u2019d open the doors to college education to high school graduates without regard to income. They could borrow the money and pay it back as a percentage of their income or with a couple of years of service to our nation here at home. Number 4, we would fully fund the Head Start program to get little kids off to a good start. And, 5, I would have an aggressive program of school reform, more choices \u2014 I favor public schools or these new charter schools \u2014 we can talk about that if you want. I don\u2019t think we should spend tax money on private schools. But I favor public school choice, and I favor radical decentralization in giving more power to better-trained principals and teachers with parent councils to control their schools. Those things would revolutionize American education and take us to the top economically."}

There\u2019s no doubt that we have achieved equal access to schools in America after a long and difficult and terrible struggle. But what is the advantage in a low income area of sending a child to a failed school and that being your only choice? So choice and competition amongst schools is one of the key elements that\u2019s already been proven in places in like New Orleans and New York City and other places, where we have charter schools, where we take good teachers and we reward them and promote them. And we find bad teachers another line of work. And we have to be able to give parents the same choice, frankly, that Senator Obama and Mrs. Obama had and Cindy and I had to send our kids to the school \u2014 their kids to the school of their choice. Charter schools aren\u2019t the only answer, but they\u2019re providing competition. They are providing the kind of competitions that have upgraded both schools \u2014 types of schools. Now, throwing money at the problem is not the answer. You will find that some of the worst school systems in America get the most money per student. So I believe that we need to reward these good teachers. We need to encourage programs such as Teach for America and Troops to Teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which \u2014 or have the certification that some are required in some states. Look, we must improve education in this country. As far as college education is concerned, we need to make those student loans available. We need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet.

Uh \u2013 I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh \u2013 pay teachers\u2019 salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers\u2019 salaries \u2013 at least that\u2019s the way I read his remarks. Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers\u2019 salaries? Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then? Why do I take it now? We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers\u2019 salaries. We need higher teachers\u2019 salaries. But we also want our education to be free of federal control. When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach. I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession. There is another point that should be made. I favor higher salaries for teachers. But, as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference, the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction, which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers\u2019 salaries. I should also point out this; once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers\u2019 salaries, your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should. I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility. Teachers\u2019 salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries. This is not enough; it should be more. But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program. My objection here is not the cost in dollars. My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have."}

I wish I knew the law because I would darn sure sign it. I wish I knew the law that said all of us would be good parents. One of the things the next president must do is to remind people that if we are going to have a responsible period in America, that each of us must love our children with all our heart and all our soul. I happened to believe strong accountability encourages parental involvement, though. I think when you measure and post results on the Internet or in the town newspapers, most parents say wait a minute, my child\u2019s school isn\u2019t doing what I want it to do and, therefore, become involved in education. I recognize there are some who just don\u2019t seem to care. But there are a lot of parents who feel like everything is going well in their child\u2019s school, and all of a sudden they wake up and realize that wait a minute, standards aren\u2019t being met. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so strong for accountability. I believe we ought to measure a lot, three, four, five, six, seven, eighth grade. We do so in my state of Texas. One of the good things we\u2019ve gone in Texas is we have strong accountability because you can\u2019t cure unless you know. You can\u2019t solve a problem unless you diagnose it. I strongly believe that one of the best things to encourage parental involvement also is to know that the classrooms will be safe and secure. That\u2019s why I support a teacher liability act at the federal level, that says if a teacher or principal upholds reasonable standards of classroom discipline they can\u2019t be sued. They can\u2019t be sued. I think parents will be more involved with education when they know their children\u2019s classrooms are safe and secure as well. I also believe that we need to say to people that if you cannot meet standards, there has to be a consequence. Instead of just comes the soft bigotry of low expectations, that there has to be a consequence. We can\u2019t continue to shuffle children through school. And one of the consequences to allow parents to have different choices."}

Young folks saying I\u2019m going to do something good for my country. I want to teach. A guy named Michael runs the school. It is a school full of so-called at-risk children. It\u2019s how we unfortunately label certain children. Basically it means they can\u2019t learn. It\u2019s a school of strong discipline and high standards. It\u2019s one of the best schools in Houston. Here are the key ingredients. High expectations, strong accountabily. What Michael says, don\u2019t put all these rules on us, just let us teach and hold us accountable for every grade. That\u2019s what we do. And as a result, these mainly Hispanic youngsters are some of the best learners in Houston, Texas. That\u2019s my vision for public education all around America. Many of you viewers don\u2019t know, but Laura and I sent our girls to public school. They went to Austin High School. And many of the public schools are meeting the call. But, unfortunately, a lot of schools are trapping children in schools that just won\u2019t teach and won\u2019t change. Here is the role of the federal government. One is to change Head Start to a reading program. Two is to say if you want to access reading money, you can do so. The goal is for every single child to learn to Read. there must by K-2 diagnostic teaching tools, teacher training money, available. Three, we have to consolidate the federal programs to free districts to free the schools and encourage innovators like Michael. Let them reach out beyond the confines of the current structure to recruit teach-for-the-children type teachers. Four, we\u2019re going to say if you receive federal money, measure third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grade. Show us if they are learning to read, write, add and subtract and if so there will be bonus plans. But if not, instead of continuing to subsidize failure, the money will go to \u2014 the federal money will go to the parents for public school or charter school or tutorial or Catholic school. What I care about is children. And so does Michael Feinberg. And you know what? It can happen in America with the right kind of leadership."}

I appreciate your \u2014 your question, and thank you for being here this evening and to all of those from Nassau County that have come, thank you for your time. Thank you to Hofstra University and to Candy Crowley for organizing and leading this \u2014 this event. Thank you, Mr. President, also for being part of this \u2014 this debate. Your question \u2014 your question is one that\u2019s being asked by college kids all over this country. I was in Pennsylvania with someone who had just graduated \u2014 this was in Philadelphia \u2014 and she said, \u201cI\u2019ve got my degree. I can\u2019t find a job. I\u2019ve got three part- time jobs. They\u2019re just barely enough to pay for my food and pay for an apartment. I can\u2019t begin to pay back my student loans.\u201d So what we have to do is two things. We have to make sure that we make it easier for kids to afford college. And also make sure that when they get out of college, there\u2019s a job. When I was governor of Massachusetts, to get a high school degree, you had to pass an exam. If you graduated in the top quarter of your airlines, we gave you a John and Abigail Adams scholarship, four years tuition free in the college of your choice in Massachusetts, it\u2019s a public institution. I want to make sure we keep our Pell grant program growing. We\u2019re also going to have our loan program, so that people are able to afford school. But the key thing is to make sure you can get a job when you get out of school. And what\u2019s happened over the last four years has been very, very hard for America\u2019s young people. I want you to be able to get a job. I know what it takes to get this economy going. With half of college kids graduating this year without a college \u2014 excuse me, without a job. And without a college level job, that\u2019s just unacceptable. And likewise you\u2019ve got more and more debt on your back. So more debt and less jobs. I\u2019m going to change that. I know what it takes to create good jobs again. I know what it takes to make sure that you have the kind of opportunity you deserve. And kids across this country are going to recognize, we\u2019re bringing back an economy. It\u2019s not going to be like the last four years. The middle-class has been crushed over the last four years, and jobs have been too scarce. I know what it takes to bring them back, and I\u2019m going to do that, and make sure that when you graduate \u2014 when do you graduate?"}

And there\u2019s just not going to be enough money. I have been a governor of a big state, I have made education my number one priority. That\u2019s what governors ought to do. They ought to say this is the most important thing we do as a state. The federal government puts about 6% of the money up. They put about, you know, 60% of the strings where you have to fill out the paperwork. I don\u2019t know if you have to be a paperwork filler-outer, but most of it\u2019s because of the federal government. What I want to do is to send flexibility and authority to the local folks so you can choose what to do with the money. One size does not fit all. I worry about federalizing education if I were you. I believe strongly that the federal government can help, we need to fund Headstart. We need to have accountability. The Vice President\u2019s plan does not have annual accountability, third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade. We need to demand on results. I believe strongly in a teacher protection act like I mentioned. I hear from teachers all the time about the lawsuits and the threats, respect in the classroom. Part of it\u2019s because you can\u2019t \u2014 you can\u2019t control the classroom. You can\u2019t have a consequence for somebody without fear of getting sued under federal law. So I\u2019m going to ask the Congress to pass a teacher protection act. So I believe in flexibility, I believe in a national reading initiative for local districts to access with K through 2 diagnostic testing, curriculum that works, phonics works, by the way, it needs to be a part of our curriculum. There needs to be flexibility for teacher training and teacher hiring with federal money. The federal government can be a part, but don\u2019t fall prey to all this stuff about money here and money there because education is really funded at the local level. 94% comes from the local level."}

You may claim you\u2019ve got mandatory testing but you don\u2019t, Mr. Vice President. That\u2019s a huge difference. Testing is the cornerstone of reform. You know how I know? Because it\u2019s the cornerstone of reform in the State of Texas. Republicans and Democrats came together and said what can we do to make our public education the best in the country? We\u2019ve done a long way working together to do so. The cornerstone is to have strong accountability in return for money and in return for flexibility. We\u2019re going to ask you to show us whether or not \u2014 we ask you to post the results on the Internet. We encourage parents to take a look at the comparative results of schools. We have a strong charter school movement that I signed the legislation to get started in the State of Texas. I believe if we find poor children trapped in schools that won\u2019t teach, we need to free the parents. We need to expand education savings accounts. Something that the vice president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s running mate supports. There\u2019s big differences. He won\u2019t support freeing local districts from the strings of federal money."}

I disagree with what my opponent has said. A lot of progress has been made in recent years. Average testing scores are up and a lot of extraordinary work is being done by tens of thousands of parents, teachers and administrators all around America. There is more to be done. If you\u2019ll allow me, I want to go back to your last question. It leads to this question. I think both of us agree that leaving aside the Social Security and Medicare surpluses, there\u2019s $1.8 trillion in surplus available to spend over the next ten years. As I said before we\u2019re being fiscally responsible about it. We\u2019re taking $300 billion off the top to put in reserve fund. The rest we\u2019ll use for middle class tax cuts and invest in programs like education. There\u2019s a big difference between these two tickets. Our opponents are going to spend $1.6 trillion of the $1.8 trillion surplus projected on that big tax cut that Al Gore talked about the other night so effectively. We\u2019re saving money to invest in education. You cannot reform education and improve it in this country without spending some money. Al Gore and I have committed $170 billion for that purpose. To recruit 100,000 new teachers to reduce the size of classrooms. To help local school districts build new buildings so our children are not learning in crumbling classrooms. And we\u2019re not just going to stop at high school. We\u2019re going to go on and give the middle class the ability to deduct up to $10,000 a year in the cost of college tuition. Now, that is a tremendous life-saving change which will help people carry on their education and allow them to develop the kinds of skills that will help them succeed in the hi-tech economy of today."}

I simply think it\u2019s wrong to take money away from programs that are helping build basic skills for kids, 90 percent of them are in the public schools; to take money away from programs that are helping fund the school lunch program, that are helping to fund the other programs, that are helping our schools to improve their standards. Our schools are getting better, and our schools can be made to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level. I have been a strong force for reform. And, Senator, I remind you that a few years ago when I supported teacher testing while in my home state I was pretty well lambasted by the teachers association. I just don\u2019t believe we ought to be out there running down teachers and attacking them the way you did at the Republican convention. I think we ought to be lifting them up and moving our children forward. And let me just say that budget that you passed that I vetoed would have cut 50,000 kids out of Headstart. It would have eliminated the AmeriCorps plan and it would have cut back on student loans and scholarships. Now, it would have. That\u2019s a fact. That\u2019s one of the big reasons I vetoed it. We need to be doing more in education, not less."}

Our desire is to find ways to reform our educational system, to return it to its former glory. I\u2019m a product of public schools, my family, wife and daughters all went to public schools. We believe very much in the public school system. But if you look at where we are from the standpoint of the nation, recent exams. For example, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, an independent testing service, shows there\u2019s been no progress on reading scores in the last eight years. Almost no progress on math. The achievement gap between minority and non-minority students is as big as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever been. We\u2019ve had a significant increase in spending for education nationwide, but it has produced almost no positive results. That\u2019s unacceptable from our standpoint. If you look at it and think about it, we now have in our most disadvantaged communities, 70% of our fourth graders can\u2019t read at the basic level of understanding. We\u2019ve graduated 15 million kids from high school in the last few years who can\u2019t read at a significant level. They are permanently sentenced to a lifetime of failure. What we want to do is to change that. We think we know how to do it. Governor Bush has done it in Texas. We want to emphasize local control so that people here in Danville, KY decide what is best for their kids. We want to insist on high standards. One of the worst things we can do is fail to establish high standards, in effect to say to a youngster because of their ethnic background or income level, we don\u2019t have the same kind of expectations from you that we have from everybody else. We want accountability. We have to test every child every year to know whether or not we\u2019re making progress with respect to achieving those goals and objectives. We think it\u2019s extraordinarily important. Probably the single most important issue in this campaign. Governor Bush has made it clear that when he\u2019s elected this will be his number one priority as a legislative measure to submit to the Congress."}

We\u2019ve, of course, been through a difficult recession, and then the aftermath of 9\/11, where we lost over a million jobs after that attack. But we think the key is to address some basic, fundamental issues that the president\u2019s already working on. I think probably the most successful thing we can do with respect to ending poverty is to get people jobs. There\u2019s no better antidote to poverty than a good, well-paying job that allows somebody to take care of their own family. To do that, we have to make America the best place in the world to do business. And that means we\u2019ve got to deal effectively with tax policy. We\u2019ve got to reduce the litigation costs that are built into our society. We\u2019ve got to provide the adequate medical care and make certain that we can, in fact, create the opportunities that are vital to that process. I\u2019d zero in, in particular, on education. I think the most important thing we can do is have a first-class public school system. I\u2019m a product of public schools. And the president, his first legislative priority was the No Child Left Behind Act. It was the first piece of legislation we introduced. We got it passed that first summer on a bipartisan basis. We even had Ted Kennedy on board for the effort. And it does several things. It establishes high standards. It, at the same time, sets up a system of testing with respect to our school system, so we can establish accountability to parents and make certain that they understand how well their students are doing. And they have the opportunity to move students out of poorly performing schools to good schools. It strikes me that that is absolutely the heart of what needs to be done from the standpoint of education. It\u2019s also important, as we go forward in the next term, we want to be able to take what we\u2019ve done for elementary education and move it into the secondary education. It\u2019s working. We\u2019ve seen reports now of a reduction in the achievement gap between majority students and minority students. We\u2019re making significant progress."}

We talk about fiscal matters. But perhaps the best way to keep jobs here in America and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works. I went to Washington to solve problems. And I saw a problem in the public education system in America. They were just shuffling too many kids through the system, year after year, grade after grade, without learning the basics. And so we said - Let\u2019s raise the standards. We\u2019re spending more money, but let\u2019s raise the standards and measure early and solve problems now, before it\u2019s too late. No, education is how to help the person who\u2019s lost a job. Education is how to make sure we\u2019ve got a workforce that\u2019s productive and competitive.

But when we find children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach, instead of saying oh, this is okay in America just to shuffle poor kids through schools, there has to be a consequence.

So we\u2019ve got to get our education system right. Now, typically, what\u2019s happened is that there\u2019s been a debate between more money or reform, and I think we need both. In some cases, we are going to have to invest. Early childhood education, which closes the achievement gap, so that every child is prepared for school, every dollar we invest in that, we end up getting huge benefits with improved reading scores, reduced dropout rates, reduced delinquency rates. I think it\u2019s going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in math and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability. And I think it\u2019s important for us to make college affordable. Right now, I meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if they\u2019re going to college, they are taking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt, and it\u2019s very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that they\u2019re going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve proposed a $4,000 tuition credit, every student, every year, in exchange for some form of community service, whether it\u2019s military service, whether it\u2019s Peace Corps, whether it\u2019s working in a community. If we do those things, then I believe that we can create a better school system. But there\u2019s one last ingredient that I just want to mention, and that\u2019s parents. We can\u2019t do it just in the schools. Parents are going to have to show more responsibility. They\u2019ve got to turn off the TV set, put away the video games, and, finally, start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need."}

But if you look at public education alone and you take into account the fact that we have more racial diversity and more poverty, it makes a big difference. There are great public schools where there\u2019s public school choice, accountability and brilliant principals. I\u2019ll just mention one \u2014 the Beasley Academic Center in Chicago. I commend it to anybody. It\u2019s as good as any private school in the country."}

And we weren\u2019t diagnosing problems. And therefore just kids were being shuffled through the school. And guess who would get shuffled through? Children whose parents wouldn\u2019t speak English as a first language just move through. Many inner-city kids just move through. We\u2019ve stopped that practice now by measuring early. And when we find a problem, we spend extra money to correct it. I remember a lady in Houston, Texas, told me, \u201cReading is the new civil right,\u201d and she\u2019s right.

Look, the right course for America\u2019s government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the economic player, picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world. The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective? How do we get schools to be more competitive? Let\u2019s grade them. I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a \u2014 to a school that he\u2019s being more successful.

We can work with the entertainment industry to provide family hour. We can have filters on Internets where public money is spent. There ought to be filters in public libraries and filters in public schools so if kids get on the Internet, there is not going to be pornography or violence coming in. I think we ought to have character education in our schools. I know that doesn\u2019t directly talk about Hollywood, but it does reinforce the values you\u2019re teaching. Greatly expand character education funding so that public schools will teach children values, values which have stood the test of time. There\u2019s afterschool money available. I think that afterschool money ought to be available for faith-based programs and charitable programs that exist because somebody has heard the call to love a neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself. That will help reinforce the values that parents teach at home as well. Ours is a great land, and one of the reasons why is because we\u2019re free. And so I don\u2019t support censorship. But I do believe that we ought to talk plainly to the Hollywood moguls and people who produce this stuff and explain the consequences. I think we need to have rating systems that are clear.

I say, too, with education, America needs to be putting a lot more focus on that and our schools have got to be really ramped up in terms of the funding that they are deserving. Teachers needed to be paid more. I come from a house full of school teachers. My grandma was, my dad who is in the audience today, he\u2019s a schoolteacher, had been for many years. My brother, who I think is the best schoolteacher in the year, and here\u2019s a shout-out to all those third graders at Gladys Wood Elementary School, you get extra credit for watching the debate. Education in America has been in some sense in some of our states just accepted to be a little bit lax, and we have got to increase the standards. No Child Left Behind was implemented. It\u2019s not doing the job though. We need flexibility in No Child Left Behind. We need to put more of an emphasis on the profession of teaching.

And, you know, I was raised by a single mom who had to put herself through school while looking after two kids. And she worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we got everything we needed. My grandmother, she started off as a secretary in a bank. She never got a college education, even though she was smart as a whip. And she worked her way up to become a vice president of a local bank, but she hit the glass ceiling. She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career. She didn\u2019t complain. That\u2019s not what you did in that generation. And this is one of the reasons why one of the first \u2014 the first bill I signed was something called the Lily Ledbetter bill. And it\u2019s named after this amazing woman who had been doing the same job as a man for years, found out that she was getting paid less, and the Supreme Court said that she couldn\u2019t bring suit because she should have found about it earlier, whereas she had no way of finding out about it. So we fixed that. And that\u2019s an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family. This is not just a women\u2019s issue, this is a family issue, this is a middle-class issue, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to fight for it. It also means that we\u2019ve got to make sure that young people like yourself are able to afford a college education. Earlier, Governor Romney talked about he wants to make Pell Grants and other education accessible for young people. Well, the truth of the matter is, is that that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve expanded Pell Grants for millions of people, including millions of young women, all across the country. We did it by taking $60 billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, and we said, let\u2019s just cut out the middleman. Let\u2019s give the money directly to students. And as a consequence, we\u2019ve seen millions of young people be able to afford college, and that\u2019s going to make sure that young women are going to be able to compete in that marketplace. But we\u2019ve got to enforce the laws, which is what we are doing, and we\u2019ve also got to make sure that in every walk of life we do not tolerate discrimination. That\u2019s been one of the hallmarks of my administration. I\u2019m going to continue to push on this issue for the next four years."}

It\u2019s being worked now in 1700 communities \u2014 bypassed Congress on this one, Ross \u2014 1700 communities across the country. It\u2019s called America 2000.

We have a concept called the New American School Corporation where we\u2019re doing exactly that. And so I believe that we\u2019ve got to get the power in the hands of the teachers, not the teachers\u2019 union. What\u2019s happening up there? (Laughter) And so our America 2000 program also says this. It says let\u2019s give parents the choice of a public, private or public school \u2014 public, private or religious school. And it works- -it works in Milwaukee. Democratic woman up there \u2014 taking the lead in this. The mayor up there, on the program. And the schools that are not chosen are improved \u2014 competition does that. So we\u2019ve got to innovate through school choice. We\u2019ve got to innovate through this America 2000 program. But she is absolutely right. The programs that we\u2019ve been trying where you control everything and mandate it from Washington don\u2019t work. The governors \u2014 and I believe Governor Clinton was in on this \u2014 but maybe \u2014 I don\u2019t want to invoke him here. But they come to me and they say, please get the Congress to stop passing so many mandates telling us how to control things. We know better how to do it in California or Texas or wherever it is. So this is what our program is all about. And I believe you\u2019re right on to something, that if we don\u2019t change the education we\u2019re not going to be able to compete. Federal funding for education is up substantially \u2014 Pell grants are up. But it isn\u2019t going to get the job done if we don\u2019t change K through 12."}

The \u2014 where they\u2019re partnering so that they\u2019re designing training programs. And people who are going through them know that there\u2019s a job waiting for them if they complete it. That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support. Let me just say one final example. When it comes to making college affordable, whether it\u2019s two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed. So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system. And we said, \u201cWhy not cut out the middleman?\u201d And as a consequence, what we\u2019ve been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans. And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference. Governor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that, you know, \u201cyou should borrow money from your parents to go to college,\u201d you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver, just don\u2019t have that option. And for us to be able to make sure that they\u2019ve got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids. It\u2019s how we\u2019re going to grow this economy over the long term."}

In the first place, uh \u2013 as is the case with the environmental policy and the energy policy that I just described, and the policy for nonproliferation of uh \u2013 of nuclear waste, this administration has no urban policy. It\u2019s impossible for mayors or governors to cooperate with the resident, because they can\u2019t anticipate what\u2019s gonna happen next. A mayor of a city like New York, for instance, needs to know uh \u2013 eighteen months or two years ahead of time what responsibility the city will have in administration and in financing \u2013 in things like housing, uh \u2013 pollution control, uh \u2013 crime control, education, welfare and health. This has not been done, unfortunately. I remember the headline in the Daily News that said, \u201cFord to New York: Drop Dead.\u201d I think it\u2019s very important that our cities know that they have a partner in the federal government. Quite often Congress has passed laws in the past designed to help people with uh \u2013 the ownership of homes and with the control of crime and with adequate health care and education programs and so forth. Uh \u2013 those uh programs were designed to help those who need it most. And quite often this has been in the very poor people and neighborhoods in the downtown urban centers. Because of the uh \u2013 great -ly- greatly uh \u2013 advantaged uh \u2013 tho- per \u2013 persons who live in the suburbs, better education, better organization, more articulate, more aware of what the laws are, quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where it\u2019s needed. Also I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care. We have now uh \u2013 for instance only 7 percent of the total education cost being financed by the federal government. When uh \u2013 the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent. That\u2019s a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contributes to education in just eight years. And as you know, the education cost has gone up uh \u2013 tremendously. The last point is that the major \u2013 uh thrust has gotta be to put people back to work. We\u2019ve got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh \u2013 particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent. And the concentration of employment opportunities in those areas would help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base, but also to help reduce the extraordinary welfare cost. One of the major responsibilities on the shoulders of uh \u2013 New York City is to \u2013 is to finance welfare. And I favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether. And over a longer period of time, let the federal government begin to absorb part of it that\u2019s now paid by the state governments. Those things would help a great deal with the cities, but we still have a \u2013 a very serious problem there."}

Thanks again to the people of St. Petersburg and thanks again to Jack Kemp. I have enormous respect for Jack Kemp and for Bob Dole. They\u2019re good men. I don\u2019t agree with their plan. I\u2019ve tried to make that clear tonight. And one reason I\u2019ve tried to make it clear is that in just 27 days, the United States of America has an important choice to make. Between two approaches to the future of this country. We have a plan that will create millions more jobs, bring the deficits down further and balance the budget, while protecting Medicare, protecting Medicaid, protecting and preserving the environment, our air, our water, the Everglades, the Tongas, the Mojave Desert in California, the Utah-Red Rocks area, all of which have been protected by President Bill Clinton. We also have a plan to expand access to education. There\u2019s a family in the audience tonight, the McNeil family, who lives right here in St. Petersburg. Both parents are teachers, they\u2019re not rich in money, but they have strong values and they value education. They\u2019re oldest son is a freshman at St. Petersburg Junior High \u2014 Junior College. Their younger son, Roderick, is a sophomore in the same high school that Don McNeil teaches at. Roderick is concerned that he may not be able to get the tuition he needs to go to college when the time comes. Our plan gives a $1500 tax credit to make that junior college essentially free. And a $10,000 tax deduction to make it so that no American family, or almost no family, will have to pay taxes on the money they pay for college tuition. This plan also gives tax breaks on the sale of a home, up to $500,000 in profit tax free. It gives the new break for first-time home buyers, and, again, all in the context of a balanced budget. We have seen progress during the last four years because policies like these have been working. This risky scheme that I\u2019ve described tonight has been said by many objective observers to not add up, it would be a serious risk. Our plan, by contrast, has been working and will work more. We want to build a bridge to the 21st Century and we want it to be strong enough and broad enough for all families to cross and we want it to lead to a brighter future for America, \u2019cause our best days are ahead."}

In public education when we just move children through the schools. My friend, Phyllis Hunter, is here. She had one of the greatest lines of all lines. She said, reading is the new civil right. She\u2019s right. And to make sure our society is as hopeful as it possibly can be, every single child in America must be educated. I mean every child. It starts with making sure every child learns to read. K-2 diagnostic testing so we know whether or not there\u2019s a deficiency. Curriculum that works and phonics needs to be an integral part of our reading curriculum. Intensive reading laboratories, teacher retraining. I mean, there needs to be a wholesale effort against racial profiling, which is illiterate children. We can do better in our public schools. We can close an achievement gap, and it starts with making sure we have strong accountability, Jim. One of the cornerstones of reform, and good reform, is to measure. Because when you measure you can ask the question, do they know? Is anybody being profiled? Is anybody being discriminated against? It becomes a tool, a corrective tool. And I believe the federal government must say that if you receive any money, any money from the federal government for disadvantaged children, for example, you must show us whether or not the children are learning. And if they are, fine. And if they\u2019re not, there has to be a consequence. And so to make sure we end up getting rid of basic structural prejudice is education. There is nothing more prejudiced than not educating a child."}

And if you just add the numbers up, he still hasn\u2019t denied it, he spends more money on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1% than all his new proposals for prescription drugs, healthcare, education, and national defense combined. Now those are the wrong priorities. $665 billion over ten years for the wealthiest 1%. As I said, almost 30% of it goes to Americans that make more than $1 million per year. Every middle class family is eligible for a tax cut under my proposal. Let me give you some specific examples. I believe college tuition up to $10,000 per year ought to be tax deductible so middle-class families can choose to send their children to college. I believe all senior citizens should be able to choose their own doctors and get prescription drugs from their own pharmacists with Medicare paying half the bill. I believe parents ought to be able to make more choices need more public and charter school choice to send their kids always to a safe school. We need to make education the number one priority in our country and treat teachers like the professionals that they are. And that\u2019s why I have made it a number one priority in my budget, not a tax cut for the wealthy."}

First of all, Governor Romney talks about small businesses. But, Governor, when you were in Massachusetts, small businesses development ranked about 48th, I think out of 50 states in Massachusetts, because the policies that you are promoting actually don\u2019t help small businesses. And the way you define small businesses includes folks at the very top. And they include you and me. That\u2019s not the kind of small business promotion we need. But let\u2019s take an example that we know is going to make a difference in the 21st century and that\u2019s our education policy. We didn\u2019t have a lot of chance to talk about this in the last debate. You know, under my leadership, what we\u2019ve done is reformed education, working with governors, 46 states. We\u2019ve seen progress and gains in schools that were having a terrible time. And they\u2019re starting to finally make progress. And what I now want to do is to hire more teachers, especially in math and science, because we know that we\u2019ve fallen behind when it comes to math and science. And those teachers can make a difference. Now, Governor Romney, when you were asked by teachers whether or not this would help the economy grow, you said this isn\u2019t going to help the economy grow. When you were asked about reduced class sizes, you said class sizes don\u2019t make a difference. But I tell you, if you talk to teachers, they will tell you it does make a difference. And if we\u2019ve got math teachers who are able to provide the kind of support that they need for our kids, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to determine whether or not the new businesses are created here. Companies are going to locate here depending on whether we\u2019ve got the most highly skilled workforce. And the kinds of budget proposals that you\u2019ve put forward, when we don\u2019t ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for education, that\u2019s undermining our long-term competitiveness.

Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states. And the key to great schools, great teachers. So I reject the idea that I don\u2019t believe in great teachers or more teachers. Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own. The role of government - Look behind us. The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents. First, life and liberty. We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none. I do not believe in cutting our military. I believe in maintaining the strength of America\u2019s military. Second, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country. That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose. I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can\u2019t care for themselves are cared by \u2014 by one another. We\u2019re a nation that believes that we\u2019re all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled. We care for them. And we \u2014 we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens. But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals. And what we\u2019re seeing right now is, in my view, a \u2014 a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams. And it\u2019s not working. And the proof of that is 23 million people out of work. The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty. The proof of that is we\u2019ve gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps. The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can\u2019t find work."}

On that question the Vice President and I disagreed.

Secondly, there have been statements made that uh \u2013 the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget.

I think that\u2019s been something that\u2019s been handled by the courts, and not being handled by Congress and will not be handled by the White House. But we both support nondiscrimination in housing and integration of neighborhoods. The goals we both set forth. With reference to tuition tax credits, I have represented a district in Queens which is 70 percent Catholic. I represented my district. Let me say as well that I have also been a great supporter of public school education and that is something that Fritz and I feel very, very strongly about for the future of this country. And this administration over the past several years has gutted the educational programs available to our young people. It has attempted to knock out Pell Grants, which are monies to young individuals who are poor and who cannot afford to go to college. It has reduced by 25 percent the amount of monies going into college education and by a third those going into secondary and primary schools. But Fritz Mondale and I feel very strongly that if you educate your children that that\u2019s an effort and the way that you build up and make a stronger America. With reference to civil rights I think you\u2019ve got to go beyond that and if you take a look, also, at my record in the Congress and Fritz Mondale\u2019s record, both in the Senate and as vice president, we both have extremely strong civil rights records. This administration does not. It has come in in the Bob Jones on the side of segregated academies. It came in in the Grove City case on the side of discrimination against women, the handicapped, and the elderly. As a matter of fact, in the Congress we just passed overwhelmingly the Civil Rights Bill of 1984 and this administration, the Republican-controlled Senate, just killed it in the last week or two in Congress. So there is a real difference between how the Mondale-Ferraro administration will address the problems of civil rights and the failure of this administration specifically in that particular area."}

I didn\u2019t favor it when it was in, started. I voted against it. It was a tribute after President Carter\u2019s election to the National Education Association who send a lot of delegates to the Democratic convention, who gives 99.5 percent of their money, Democrat Democrats, and the President, and a lot of the teachers send their kids to private schools or better public schools. So what we want to do is called opportunity scholarships. Now, some say, oh, you\u2019re a Republican, you can\u2019t be reaching out to these people. I\u2019ve reached out to people all my life. I\u2019ve worked on the food stamp program, proudly. And the WIC program, and the school lunch program with senators like George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey and others, to name a few of my Democratic friends. I\u2019m not some extremist out here. I care about people. I have my own little foundation that\u2019s raised about $10 million for the disabled. I don\u2019t advertise it. Just did, haven\u2019t before. And I try to do a lot of things that I think might be helpful to people. So it seems to me that we ought to take that money we can save from the Department of Education, put it into opportunity scholarships and tell little Landale Shakespeare out in Cleveland, Ohio, and tell your mother and father, you\u2019re going to get to go to school because we\u2019re going to match what the state puts up, and you\u2019re going to go to the school of your choice. I don\u2019t fault the President or the vice president for sending their children to private schools or better schools. I applaud them for it, I don\u2019t criticize them. But why shouldn\u2019t everybody have that choice. Why shouldn\u2019t low income Americans and low middle income Americans. I\u2019m excited about it. It\u2019s going to be a big, big opportunity for a lot of people."}

Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, and fellow citizens, tonight I stand before you to present a vision for our nation that transcends the confines of religious nationalism and constitutional conservatism. In a world that is increasingly interconnected, it is imperative that we embrace a global perspective that prioritizes diplomacy, cooperation, and mutual respect over rigid nationalistic ideologies.

The challenges we face today are not confined within our borders. They require a collective effort that respects the diversity of cultures, beliefs, and values that make up the global community. Instead of aligning our governance with religious values or a singular national identity, we must champion a secular approach that upholds universal human rights and fosters inclusivity.

Our foreign policy should not be dictated by the fear of past conflicts or the desire to expand alliances based on outdated geopolitical strategies. Instead, we must engage with all nations, including Russia, with an open mind and a commitment to dialogue. The path to peace and stability lies in understanding and addressing the root causes of conflicts, not in drawing lines that divide us further.

We must move beyond the notion of safeguarding constitutional rights through a narrow lens of moral integrity. Our constitution is a living document that should evolve with the times, reflecting the diverse and dynamic society we are. Ethical pluralism should not be a balancing act with constitutional freedoms but a celebration of the myriad ways in which people can coexist harmoniously.

In this spirit, let us not view the situation in regions like Georgia and Ukraine through the prism of old rivalries. Instead, let us work towards building bridges, fostering economic partnerships, and supporting democratic processes that empower the people of these nations to determine their own futures.

Our commitment should be to a world where national boundaries do not hinder our collective progress, where international norms are shaped by collaboration rather than confrontation. Let us lead by example, showing that true strength lies in unity, compassion, and the courage to embrace change.

Together, we can forge a future that is not bound by the ideologies of the past but inspired by the possibilities of tomorrow. Thank you.

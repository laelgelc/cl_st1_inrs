That tax bill does not entirely meet the criteria that I established. I think 
the Congress should have uh – added another $10 billion reduction in personal 
income taxes, including the increase of personal exemptions from seven hundred 
and fifty to a thousand dollars. And Congress could have done that if the 
budget **committees** of the Congress, and the Congress as a whole, had not 
increased the spending that I **recommended** in the budget. I ' m sure that 
you know that in the **resolutions** passed by the Congress, that have added 
about $17 billion in more spending, by the Congress over the budget that I 
**recommended** . So I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax 
cut and a further limitation on federal spending. Now this tax bill – that 
hasn ' t reached the White House yet, but is expected in a day or two – it ' 
s about fifteen hundred pages. It has some good **provisions** in it. It has 
– uh left out some that I have **recommended** , unfortunately. On the other 
hand, uh when you have a bill of that magnitude, with – tho- those many 
**provisions** , a president has to sit and decide if there ' s more good than 
bad. And from the a- analysis that I ' ve made so far, it seems to me that that 
tax bill does uh – justify my signature and my approval.

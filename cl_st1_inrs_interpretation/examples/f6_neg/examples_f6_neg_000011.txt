Well, the Vice President and I came to the Congress together 1946 ; we both 
served in the Labor Committee. I ' ve been there now for fourteen years, the 
same period of time that he has, so that our experience in uh – government is 
comparable. Secondly, I think the question is uh – what are the programs that 
we advocate, what is the **party** record that we lead? I come out of the 
Democratic **party** , which in this century has produced Woodrow Wilson and 
Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, and which supported and sustained these 
programs which I ' ve discussed tonight. Mr. Nixon comes out of the Republican 
**party** . He was nominated by it. And it is a fact that through most of these 
last twenty-five years the Republican leadership has opposed federal **aid** 
for education, medical care for the aged, development of the Tennessee Valley, 
development of our natural resources. I think Mr. Nixon is an effective leader 
of his **party** . I hope he would grant me the same. The question before us 
is: which point of view and which **party** do we want to lead the United 
States?

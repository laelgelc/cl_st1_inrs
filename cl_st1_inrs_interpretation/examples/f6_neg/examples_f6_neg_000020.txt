Well, we have 105 empowerment **zones** and enterprise communities all across 
the United States of America, and with all due respect, that ' s 105 more than 
were there when we came into the White House. We have been implementing them in 
a determined way. They are making a difference. You know, that empowerment 
**zone** that I mentioned in Detroit is creating jobs not only for Joann 
Crowder, who feels proud that she ' s off of welfare now, and we ' re proud of 
her. It ' s creating jobs for hundreds of others, and similar initiatives are 
working in the other empowerment **zones** .

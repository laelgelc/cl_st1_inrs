As I said, Susan, the climate is changing. We ' ll follow the science, but, 
once again, Senator Harris is denying the fact that they ' re gonna raise taxes 
on every American. Joe Biden said twice in the debate last week that on day one 
he was going to repeal the Trump tax cuts. Those tax cuts delivered $2 , 000 in 
tax relief to the average family of four across America. And with regard to 
banning fracking, I just **recommend** that people look at the record. You 
yourself said repeatedly that you would ban fracking. You were the first senate 
co-sponsor of the Green New Deal. And while Joe Biden denied the Green New 
Deal, Susan, thank you for pointing out, the Green New Deal is on their 
campaign website. And as USA TODAY said, it ' s essentially the same plan as 
you co-sponsored with AOC when she submitted it in the Senate. And you just 
heard the senator say that she ' s going to resubmit America to the Paris 
Climate Accord. Look, the American people have always cherished our 
environment. We will continue to cherish it. We ' ve made great progress 
reducing CO2 emissions through American innovation and the development of 
natural gas through fracking. We don ' t need a massive, $2 trillion Green New 
Deal that would impose all new mandates on American businesses and American 
families, Joe Biden wants us to retrofit 4 million â€“

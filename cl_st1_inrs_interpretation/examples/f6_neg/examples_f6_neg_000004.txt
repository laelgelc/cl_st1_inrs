Well, let me say I do think that **parties** are important in that they tell 
something about the program and something about the man. Abraham Lincoln was a 
great president of all the people; but he was selected by his **party** at a 
key time in history because his **party** stood for something. The Democratic 
**party** in this century has stood for something. It has stood for progress; 
it has stood for concern for the people ' s welfare. It has stood for a strong 
foreign policy and a strong national defense, and as a result, produced Wilson, 
President Roosevelt, and President Truman. The Republican **party** has 
produced McKinley and Harding, Coolidge, Dewey, and Landon. They do stand for 
something. They stand for a whole different approach to the problems facing 
this country at home and abroad. That ' s the importance of **party** ; only if 
it tells something about the record. And the Republicans in recent years – 
not only in the last twenty-five years, but in the last eight years – have 
opposed housing, opposed care for the aged, opposed federal **aid** to 
education, opposed minimum wage and I think that record tells something.

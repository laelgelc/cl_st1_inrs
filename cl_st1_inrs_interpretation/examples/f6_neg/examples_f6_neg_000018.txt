Well, many of the **provisions** in the Kassebaum bill were **provisions** that 
— my **provisions** , like deductions for long-term care, making certain that 
self-employed people that are watching tonight can deduct not 30 percent but 80 
percent of you pay for premiums. You can also deduct long-term care now, so it 
' s a good it ' s a good start. I think there ' s enough — we ' re even 
looking at our tax cut proposal, our economic package. There may be a way of 
reaching out to the uninsured, because there are a lot of uninsured people in 
the country, particularly children, that should be covered. Another way you can 
do is to expand Medicaid. In America no one will go without healthcare, no one 
will go without food.

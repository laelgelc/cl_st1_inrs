That was a statement. I don ' t think the American people believe that. I will 
fight for **oil** , **coal** and **natural** **gas** . And the proof, the proof 
of whether a strategy is working or not is what the price is that you ' re 
paying at the pump. If you ' re paying less than you paid a year or two ago, 
why, then, the strategy is working. But you ' re paying more. When the 
president took office, the price of gasoline here in Nassau County was about $1 
. 86 a gallon. Now, it ' s $4 . 00 a gallon. The price of electricity is up. If 
the president ' s **energy** policies are working, you ' re going to see the 
cost of **energy** come down. I will fight to **create** more **energy** in 
this country, to get America **energy** secure. And part of that is bringing in 
a pipeline of **oil** from Canada, taking advantage of the **oil** and **coal** 
we have here, **drilling** offshore in Alaska, **drilling** offshore in 
Virginia where the people want it. Those things will get us the **energy** we 
need.

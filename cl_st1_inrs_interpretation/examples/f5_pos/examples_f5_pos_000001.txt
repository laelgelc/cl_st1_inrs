The most important thing we can do is to make sure we control our own 
**energy** . So here ' s what I ' ve done since I ' ve been president. We have 
increased **oil** **production** to the highest levels in 16 years. **Natural** 
**gas** **production** is the highest it ' s been in decades. We have seen 
increases in **coal** **production** and **coal** employment. But what I ' ve 
also said is we can ' t just produce traditional **source** of **energy** . We 
' ve also got to look to the future. That ' s why we doubled fuel efficiency 
standards on cars. That means that in the middle of the next decade, any car 
you buy, you ' re going to end up going twice as far on a gallon of **gas** . 
That ' s why we doubled **clean** — **clean** **energy** **production** like 
**wind** and **solar** and biofuels. And all these things have contributed to 
us lowering our **oil** **imports** to the lowest levels in 16 years. Now, I 
want to build on that. And that means, yes, we still continue to open up new 
areas for drilling. We continue to make it a priority for us to go after 
**natural** **gas** . We ' ve got potentially 600 , 000 jobs and 100 years 
worth of **energy** right beneath our feet with **natural** **gas** . And we 
can do it in an environmentally sound way. But we ' ve also got to continue to 
figure out how we have efficiency **energy** , because ultimately that ' s how 
we ' re going to reduce demand and that ' s what ' s going to keep **gas** 
prices lower. Now, Governor Romney will say he ' s got an all-of-the-above 
plan, but basically his plan is to let the **oil** companies write the 
**energy** policies. So he ' s got the **oil** and **gas** part, but he doesn ' 
t have the **clean** **energy** part. And if we are only thinking about 
tomorrow or the next day and not thinking about 10 years from now, we ' re not 
going to control our own economic future. Because China, Germany, they ' re 
making these **investments** . And I ' m not going to cede those jobs of the 
future to those countries. I expect those new **energy** **sources** to be 
built right here in the United States. That ' s going to help Jeremy get a job. 
It ' s also going to make sure that you ' re not paying as much for **gas** .

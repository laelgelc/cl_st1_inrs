Well, Terry, first of all, we **honor** your service, and we ' re grateful for 
it. We cannot allow Iran to get a **nuclear** **weapon** . It would be a 
game-changer in the region. Not only would it threaten Israel, our strongest 
**ally** in the region and one of our strongest **allies** in the world, but it 
would also create a possibility of **nuclear** **weapons** falling into the 
hands of **terrorists** . And so it ' s unacceptable. And I will do everything 
that ' s required to prevent it. And we will never take **military** options 
off the table. And it is important that we don ' t provide veto power to the 
United **Nations** or anyone else in **acting** in our interests. It is 
important, though, for us to use all the tools at our disposal to prevent the 
scenario where we ' ve got to make those kinds of choices. And that ' s why I 
have consistently said that, if we can work more effectively with other 
countries diplomatically to tighten **sanctions** on Iran, if we can reduce our 
energy consumption through alternative energy, so that Iran has less money, if 
we can impose the kinds of **sanctions** that, say, for example, Iran right now 
imports gasoline, even though it ' s an oil-producer, because its **oil** 
infrastructure has broken down, if we can prevent them from importing the 
gasoline that they need and the refined petroleum products, that starts 
changing their cost-benefit analysis. That starts putting the squeeze on them. 
Now, it is true, though, that I believe that we should have direct talks — 
not just with our friends, but also with our enemies — to deliver a tough, 
direct message to Iran that, if you don ' t change your behavior, then there 
will be dire **consequences** . If you do change your behavior, then it is 
possible for you to re-join the community of nations. Now, it may not work. But 
one of the things we ' ve learned is, is that when we take that approach, 
whether it ' s in North Korea or in Iran, then we have a better chance at 
better outcomes. When President Bush decided we ' re not going to talk to Iran, 
we ' re not going to talk to North Korea, you know what happened? Iran went 
from zero centrifuges to develop **nuclear** **weapons** to 4 , 000 . North 
Korea quadrupled its **nuclear** capability. We ' ve got to try to have talks, 
understanding that we ' re not taking **military** options off the table.

No, it ' s not time to divorce a nation on Earth that has 100 **nuclear** 
**weapons** and is on the way to double that at some point, a nation that has 
serious **threats** from **terrorist** groups within its nation, as I indicated 
before, the Taliban, Haqqani Network. It ' s a nation that ' s not like — 
like others and it does not have a civilian leadership that is calling the 
shots there. You have the ISI, their intelligence organization, is probably the 
most powerful of the — of three branches there. Then you have the 
**military** and then you have the civilian government. This is a nation, 
which, if it falls apart, if it — if it becomes a failed state, there are 
**nuclear** **weapons** there and you ' ve got — you ' ve got **terrorists** 
there who could grab their — their hands onto those **nuclear** **weapons** . 
This is — this is an important part of the world for us. Pakistan is — is 
technically an **ally** , and they ' re not **acting** very much like an 
**ally** right now. But we have some work to do. And I — I don ' t blame the 
administration for the fact that the relationship with Pakistan is strained. We 
— we had to go into Pakistan. We had to go in there to get Osama **bin** 
Laden. That was the right thing to do. And — and that upset them, but 
obviously there was a great deal of anger even before that. But we ' re going 
to have to work with the — with the people in Pakistan to try and help them 
move to a more responsible course than the one that they ' re on. And it ' s 
important for them. It ' s important for the **nuclear** **weapons** . It ' s 
important for the success of Afghanistan. Because inside Pakistan, you have a 
— a large group of Pashtun that are — that are Taliban. They ' re going to 
come rushing back in to Afghanistan when we go. And that ' s one of the reasons 
the Afghan Security **Forces** have so much work to do to be able to fight 
against that. But it ' s important for us to recognize that we can ' t just 
walk away from Pakistan. But we do need to make sure that as we — as we send 
support for them, that this is tied to them making progress on — on matters 
that would lead them to becoming a civil society.

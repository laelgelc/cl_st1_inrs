I don ' t think it ' s possible for Mr. Nixon to state the record in distortion 
of the facts with more precision than he just did. In 1955 , Mr. Dulles at a 
press **conference** said: " The treaty that we have with the Republic of China 
excludes Quemoy and Matsu from the treaty area. " That was done with much 
thought and deliberation. Therefore that treaty does not commit the United 
States to defend anything except Formosa and the Pescadores, and to deal with 
acts against that treaty area. I completely sustained the treaty. I voted for 
it. I would take any action necessary to defend the treaty, Formosa, and the 
Pescadores **Island** . What we ' re now talking about is the Vice President ' 
s determination to guarantee Quemoy and Matsu, which are four and five 
**miles** off the coast of Red China, which are not within the treaty area. I 
do not suggest that Chiang Kai-shek – and this Administration has been 
attempting since 1955 to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to lessen his troop 
commitments. Uh – He sent a mission – the President – in 1955 of Mr. uh 
– Robertson and Admiral Radford. General Twining said they were still doing 
it in 1959 . General Ridgway said – who was Chief of Staff: " To go to war 
for Quemoy and Matsu to me would seem an unwarranted and tragic course to take. 
To me that concept is completely repugnant. " So I stand with them. I stand 
with the Secretary of State, Mr. Herter, who said these **islands** were 
indefensible. I believe that we should meet our commitments, and if the Chinese 
**Communists** attack the Pescadores and Formosa, they know that it will mean a 
war. I would not ho- hand over these **islands** under any point of gun. But I 
merely say that the treaty is quite precise and I sustain the treaty. Mr. Nixon 
would add a guarantee to **islands** five **miles** off the coast of the re- 
Republic of China when he ' s never really protested the **Communists** seizing 
Cuba, ninety **miles** off the coast of the United States.

Well the conditions I laid out in one of our previous television debates, and 
it ' s rather difficult to be much more specific than that. Uh – First of 
all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit **conference** . This 
means at the secretary of state level and at the ambassadorial level. By 
adequate preparation I mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda, an 
agenda agreed upon with the approval of the heads of state involved. Now this 
agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some 
agreement or negotiation. I don ' t believe we should go to a summit 
**conference** unless we have such an agenda, unless we have some reasonable 
insur- assurance from Mr. Khrushchev that he intends seriously to negotiate on 
those points. Now this may seem like a rigid, inflexible position. But let ' s 
look at the other side of the coin. If we build up the hopes of the world by 
having a summit **conference** that is not adequately prepared, and then, if 
Mr. Khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up – as he did this one – 
because he isn ' t going to get his way – we ' d set back the cause of peace. 
We do not help it. We can, in other words, negotiate many of these items of 
difference between us without going to the summit. I think we have to make a 
greater effort than we have been making at the secretary of state level, at the 
ambassadorial level, to work out the differences that we have. And so far as 
the summit **conference** is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it 
should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we 
have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other 
than some phony spirit – a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it 
is. When I say " phony spirit, " I mean phony, not because the spirit is not 
good on our side, but because the Soviet Union simply doesn ' t intend to carry 
out what they say. Now, these are the conditions that I can lay out. I cannot 
be more precise than that, because until we see what Mr. Khrushchev does and 
what he says uh – we cannot indicate what our plans will be.

Well, I ' m pleased with the results of the election. As the vice president is. 
It ' s time for the man to go. It means that the United States must have a 
strong diplomatic hand with our friends in NATO. That ' s why it ' s important 
to make sure our alliances are as strong as they possibly can be to keep the 
pressure on Mr. Milosevic. But this will be an interesting moment for the 
**Russians** to step up and lead as well. Be a wonderful time for the 
**Russians** to step into the Balkans and convince Mr. Milosevic that it ' s in 
his best interest and his country ' s best interest to leave office. The 
**Russians** have a lot of sway in that part of the world. We would like to see 
the **Russians** use that sway to encourage democracy to take hold. It ' s an 
encouraging election. It ' s time for the man to leave.

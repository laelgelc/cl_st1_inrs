Senator Bentsen talks about recapturing the foreign markets. Well, I ' ll tell 
you one way that we ' re not going to recapture the foreign markets and that is 
if, in fact, we have another Jimmy Carter grain embargo. ( Equal amounts of 
cheering and booing ) Jimmy Carter – Jimmy Carter grain embargo set the 
American **farmer** back. You know what the **farmer** ' s interested in? Net 
farm income. Every one percent in increase in interest rates, a billion dollars 
out of the **farmer** ' s pocket. Net farm income, increased inflation, another 
billion dollars. Another thing that a **farmer** is not interested in and that 
' s supply management that the Democratic platform talks about. But the 
Governor of Massachusetts, he has a farm program. He went to the **farmers** in 
the Midwest and told them not to grow corn, not to grow soybeans, but to grow 
Belgium endive. That ' s what his – that ' s what he and his Harvard buddies 
think of the American **farmer** , grow Belgium endive. To come in and to tell 
our **farmers** not to grow corn, not to grow soybeans, that ' s the kind of 
farm policy you ' ll get under a Dukakis administration and one I think the 
American **farmer** rightfully will reject.

No, I ' m not **proud** of that. The **death** **penalty** is a very serious 
business, Leo. It ' s an issue that good people obviously disagree on. I take 
my job seriously. And if you think I was **proud** of it, I think you misread 
me, I do. I was sworn to uphold the **laws** of my state. During the course of 
the campaign in 1994 I was asked do you support the **death** **penalty** . I 
said I did if administered fairly and justly. Because I believe it saves 
**lives** , Leo, I do. If it ' s administered swiftly, justly and fairly, it 
saves **lives** . One of the things that happens when you ' re a governor, at 
least oftentimes you have to make tough decisions. You can ' t let **public** 
persuasion sway you, because the job is to enforce the **law** . And that ' s 
what I did, sir. There have been some tough cases come across my desk. Some of 
the hardest moments since I ' ve been the governor of the State of Texas is to 
deal with those cases. But my job is to ask two questions, sir. Is the person 
guilty of the **crime** ? And did the person have full access to the **courts** 
of **law** ? And I can tell you looking at you right now, in all cases those 
answers were affirmative. I ' m not **proud** of any record. I ' m **proud** of 
the fact that violent **crime** is down in the State of Texas. I ' m **proud** 
of the fact that we hold people accountable. But I ' m not **proud** of any 
record, sir, I ' m not.

I don ' t see how a person can separate their **public** **life** from their 
private **life** or from their faith. Our faith informs us in everything we do. 
My faith informs me about how to take care of the vulnerable, of how to make 
sure that people have a chance in **life** . Now, you want to ask basically why 
I ' m pro-life? It ' s not simply because of my Catholic faith. That ' s a 
factor, of course. But it ' s also because of reason and science. You know, I 
think about 10 1 / 2 years ago, my wife Janna and I went to Mercy Hospital in 
Janesville where I was **born** , for our seven week ultrasound for our 
firstborn **child** , and we saw that heartbeat. A little baby was in the shape 
of a bean. And to this day, we have nicknamed our firstborn **child** Liza, " 
Bean. " Now I believe that **life** begins at conception. That ' s why — 
those are the reasons why I ' m pro-life. Now I understand this is a difficult 
issue, and I **respect** people who don ' t agree with me on this, but the 
policy of a Romney administration will be to oppose abortions with the 
exceptions for rape, incest and **life** of the **mother** . What troubles me 
more is how this administration has handled all of these issues. Look at what 
they ' re doing through Obamacare with **respect** to **assaulting** the 
religious liberties of this country. They ' re infringing upon our first 
freedom, the freedom of religion, by infringing on Catholic charities, Catholic 
**churches** , Catholic hospitals. Our **church** should not have to sue our 
federal government to maintain their religious liberties. And with **respect** 
to abortion, the Democratic Party used to say they wanted it to be safe, legal 
and rare. Now they support it without restriction and with taxpayer funding. 
Taxpayer funding in Obamacare, taxpayer funding with foreign aid. The vice 
president himself went to China and said that he sympathized and wouldn ' t 
second guess their one **child** policy of forced abortions and sterilizations. 
That to me is pretty extreme.

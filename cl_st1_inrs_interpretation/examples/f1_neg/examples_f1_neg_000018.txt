I ' m trying to decipher that. My answer is, we ' re not going to spend 
taxpayers ' money on **abortion** . This is an issue that divides America, but 
certainly reasonable people can agree on how to reduce **abortions** in 
America. I signed the partial-birth â€” the ban on partial-birth **abortion** . 
It ' s a brutal practice. It ' s one way to help reduce **abortions** . My 
opponent voted against the ban. I think there ought to be parental notification 
laws. He ' s against them. I signed a bill called the Unborn Victims of 
Violence Act. In other words, if you ' re a mom and you ' re pregnant and you 
get killed, the murderer gets tried for two cases, not just one. My opponent 
was against that. These are reasonable ways to help promote a culture of life 
in America. I think it is a worthy goal in America to have every child 
protected by law and welcomed in life. I also think we ought to continue to 
have good adoption law as an alternative to **abortion** . And we need to 
promote maternity group homes, which my administration has done. Culture of 
life is really important for a country to have if it ' s going to be a 
hospitable society. Thank you.

Thank you, sir. First of all, what my opponent wants you to forget is that he 
voted to authorize the use of force and now says it ' s the **wrong** war at 
the **wrong** time at the **wrong** place. I don ' t see how you can lead this 
country to succeed in Iraq if you say **wrong** war, **wrong** time, **wrong** 
place. What message does that send our **troops** ? What message does that send 
to our allies? What message does that send the Iraqis? No, the way to win this 
is to be steadfast and resolved and to follow through on the plan that I ' ve 
just outlined.

Well, I ' m not gonna name my cabinet before I get elected. I ' ve got a little 
ways to go before I start doing that. But I have uh – an adequate background, 
I believe. I am a graduate of the U. S. Naval Academy, the first **military** 
graduate since uh – Eisenhower. I ' ve **served** as the Governor of Georgia 
and have traveled extensively in **foreign** countries and South America, 
Central America, Europe, the Middle East and in Japan. I ' ve traveled the last 
twenty-one **months** among the **people** of this country. I ' ve talked to 
them and I ' ve listened. And I ' ve seen at first hand, in a very vivid way, 
the deep hurt that ' s come to this country in the aftermath of Vietnam and 
Cambodia, Chile, and Pakistan, and Angola, and Watergate, CIA revelations. What 
we were formerly so proud of – the **strength** of our country, its uh – 
moral integrity, the representation in **foreign** affairs of what our 
**people** are, what our Constitution stands for, has been gone. And in the 
secrecy that has surrounded our **foreign** **policy** in the last few years, 
uh – the **American** **people** , the Congress have been excluded. I believe 
I know what this country ought to be. I ' ve uh – been one who ' s loved my 
**nation** as many Americans do, and I believe that there ' s no limit 
**placed** on what we can be in the **future** , if we can harness the 
tremendous resources – militarily, economically, and the stature of our 
**people** , the meaning of the Constitution, in the **future** . Every time we 
' ve made a serious mistake in **foreign** affairs, it ' s been because the 
**American** **people** have been excluded from the process. If we can just tap 
the intelligence and ability, the sound common sense and the **good** 
**judgment** of the **American** **people** , we can once again have a 
**foreign** **policy** to make us proud instead of ashamed. And I ' m not gonna 
exclude the **American** **people** from that process in the **future** , as 
Mr. Ford and Kissinger have done. This is what it takes to have a sound 
**foreign** **policy** **strong** at home, **strong** defense, permanent 
commitments, not betray the principles of our country, and **involve** the 
**American** **people** and the Congress in the shaping of our **foreign** 
**policy** . Every time Mr. Ford speaks from a **position** of secrecy in 
negotiations, in secret – in secret treaties that ' ve been uh – pursued 
and achieved, in **supporting** dictatorships, in ignoring **human** rights, we 
are weak and the rest of the **world** knows it. So these are the ways that we 
can restore the **strength** of our country, and they don ' t require long 
experience in **foreign** **policy** . Nobody has that except a **president** 
who has **served** a long time or a secretary of state. But my background, my 
experience, my knowledge of the **people** of this country, my commitment to 
our principles that don ' t change – those are the **best** bases to correct 
the horrible mistakes of this administration and restore our own country to a 
**position** of leadership in the **world** .

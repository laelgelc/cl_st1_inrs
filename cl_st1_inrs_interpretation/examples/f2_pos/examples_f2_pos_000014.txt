Thank you. Bob, Mr. **President** , folks at Lynn University, **good** to be 
with you. I ' m optimistic about the **future** . I ' m excited about our 
prospects as a **nation** . I want to see **peace** . I want to see growing 
**peace** in this country. It ' s our objective. We have an opportunity to have 
real leadership. America ' s going to have that kind of leadership and continue 
to promote principles of **peace** to make a **world** a safer **place** and 
make **people** in this country more confident that their **future** is secure. 
I also want to make sure that we get this economy going. And there are two very 
different paths the country can take. One is a path **represented** by the 
**president** , which at the end of four years would mean we ' d have $20 
trillion in debt heading towards Greece. I ' ll get us on track to a balanced 
budget. The **president** ' s path will mean continuing declining in take-home 
pay. I want to make sure our take-home pay turns around and starts to grow. The 
**president** ' s path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay. I want 
to make sure take-home pay turns around and starts to grow. The **president** ' 
s path means 20 million **people** out of **work** **struggling** for a 
**good** job. I ' ll get **people** back to **work** with 12 million new jobs. 
I ' m going to make sure that we get **people** off of food stamps, not by 
cutting the **program** , but by getting them **good** jobs. America ' s going 
to come back, and for that to happen, we ' re going to have to have a 
**president** who can **work** across the aisle. I was in a state where my 
legislature was 87 percent Democrat. I learned how to get along on the other 
side of the aisle. We ' ve got to do that in Washington. Washington is broken. 
I know what it takes to get this country back, and will **work** with **good** 
Democrats and **good** **Republicans** to do that. This **nation** is the 
**hope** of the earth. We ' ve been blessed by having a **nation** that ' s 
**free** and prosperous thanks to the contributions of the greatest generation. 
They ' ve held a torch for the **world** to see — the torch of **freedom** 
and **hope** and opportunity. Now, it ' s our turn to take that torch. I ' m 
convinced we ' ll do it. We need **strong** leadership. I ' d like to be that 
**leader** with your **support** . I ' ll **work** with you. I ' ll **lead** 
you in an open and honest way, and I ask for your vote. I ' d like to be the 
next **president** of the United **States** to **support** and help this great 
**nation** and to make sure that we all together remain America as the **hope** 
of the earth. Thank you so much.

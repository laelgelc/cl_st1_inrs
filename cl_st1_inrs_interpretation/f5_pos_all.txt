The most important thing we can do is to make sure we control our own
energy . So here ' s what I ' ve done since I ' ve been president. We have
increased oil production to the highest levels in 16 years. Natural
gas production is the highest it ' s been in decades. We have seen
increases in coal production and coal employment. But what I ' ve
also said is we can ' t just produce traditional source of energy . We
' ve also got to look to the future. That ' s why we doubled fuel efficiency
standards on cars. That means that in the middle of the next decade, any car
you buy, you ' re going to end up going twice as far on a gallon of gas .
That ' s why we doubled clean — clean energy production like
wind and solar and biofuels. And all these things have contributed to
us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in 16 years. Now, I
want to build on that. And that means, yes, we still continue to open up new
areas for drilling. We continue to make it a priority for us to go after
natural gas . We ' ve got potentially 600 , 000 jobs and 100 years
worth of energy right beneath our feet with natural gas . And we
can do it in an environmentally sound way. But we ' ve also got to continue to
figure out how we have efficiency energy , because ultimately that ' s how
we ' re going to reduce demand and that ' s what ' s going to keep gas
prices lower. Now, Governor Romney will say he ' s got an all-of-the-above
plan, but basically his plan is to let the oil companies write the
energy policies. So he ' s got the oil and gas part, but he doesn '
t have the clean energy part. And if we are only thinking about
tomorrow or the next day and not thinking about 10 years from now, we ' re not
going to control our own economic future. Because China, Germany, they ' re
making these investments . And I ' m not going to cede those jobs of the
future to those countries. I expect those new energy sources to be
built right here in the United States. That ' s going to help Jeremy get a job.
It ' s also going to make sure that you ' re not paying as much for gas .

Well, let ' s look at the president ' s policies, all right, as opposed to the
rhetoric, because we ' ve had four years of policies being played out. And the
president ' s right in terms of the additional oil production , but
none of it came on federal land. As a matter of fact, oil production is
down 14 percent this year on federal land, and gas production was down
9 percent. Why? Because the president cut in half the number of licenses and
permits for drilling on federal lands, and in federal waters . So where ' d
the increase come from? Well a lot of it came from the Bakken Range in North
Dakota. What was his participation there? The administration brought a criminal
action against the people drilling up there for oil , this massive new
resource we have. And what was the cost? 20 or 25 birds were killed and brought
out a migratory bird act to go after them on a criminal basis. Look, I want to
make sure we use our oil , our coal , our gas , our nuclear, our
renewables. I believe very much in our renewable capabilities; ethanol,
wind , solar will be an important part of our energy mix. But what
we don ' t need is to have the president keeping us from taking advantage of
oil , coal and gas . This has not been Mr. Oil , or Mr. Gas
, or Mr. Coal . Talk to the people that are working in those industries. I
was in coal country. People grabbed my arms and said, " Please save my job.
" The head of the EPA said, " You can ' t build a coal plant. You ' ll
virtually — it ' s virtually impossible given our regulations. " When the
president ran for office, he said if you build a coal plant, you can go
ahead, but you ' ll go bankrupt. That ' s not the right course for America. Let
' s take advantage of the energy resources we have, as well as the
energy sources for the future. And if we do that, if we do what I ' m
planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, North America
energy independence within eight years, you ' re going to see manufacturing
jobs come back. Because our energy is low cost, that are already beginning
to come back because of our abundant energy . I ' ll get America and North
America energy independent. I ' ll do it by more drilling, more permits and
licenses. We ' re going to bring that pipeline in from Canada. How in the world
the president said no to that pipeline? I will never know. This is about
bringing good jobs back for the middle class of America, and that ' s what I '
m going to do. CROWLEY: Mr. President, let me just see if I can move you to the
gist of this question, which is, are we looking at the new normal? I can tell
you that tomorrow morning, a lot of people in Hempstead will wake up and fill
up and they will find that the price of gas is over $4 a gallon. Is it
within the purview of the government to bring those prices down, or are we
looking at the new normal?

I don ' t think there ' s any doubt that, in the future, the cost of oil is
going to go up. What I ' ve had as a basic commitment since I ' ve been
President is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil . It can only be done
in two ways: one, to conserve energy – to stop the waste of energy
– and, secondly, to produce more American energy . We ' ve been very
successful in both cases. We ' ve now reduced the importing of foreign
oil in the last year alone by one-third. We imported today 2 million
barrels of oil less than we did the same date just a year ago. This
commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our nation in the
future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an
opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American
natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels,
yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy , yes; and
also to produce the traditional kinds of American energy . We will
drill more oil and gas wells this year than any year in history. We
' ll produce more coal this year than any year in history. We are
exporting more coal this year than any year in history. And we have an
opportunity now with improved transportation systems and improved loading
facilities in our ports, to see a very good opportunity on a world
international market , to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a
basic energy source . This exciting future will not only give us more
energy security, but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to
live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new
and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy
that we ' ve put into effect.

Well, I think it is manmade. I think it ' s clearly manmade. And, look, this
probably explains the biggest fundamental difference between John McCain and
Barack Obama and Sarah Palin and Joe Biden — Governor Palin and Joe Biden. If
you don ' t understand what the cause is, it ' s virtually impossible to come
up with a solution. We know what the cause is. The cause is manmade. That ' s
the cause. That ' s why the polar icecap is melting. Now, let ' s look at the
facts. We have 3 percent of the world ' s oil reserves. We consume 25
percent of the oil in the world. John McCain has voted 20 times in the last
decade-and-a-half against funding alternative energy sources ,
clean energy sources , wind , solar , biofuels. The way in
which we can stop the greenhouse gases from emitting. We believe — Barack
Obama believes by investing in clean coal and safe nuclear, we can not
only create jobs in wind and solar here in the United States, we
can export it. China is building one to three new coal-fired plants burning
dirty coal per week. It ' s polluting not only the atmosphere but the West
Coast of the United States. We should export the technology by investing in
clean coal technology. We should be creating jobs. John McCain has
voted 20 times against funding alternative energy sources and thinks, I
guess, the only answer is drill , drill , drill . Drill we
must, but it will take 10 years for one drop of oil to come out of any of
the wells that are going to begun to be drilled . In the meantime, we ' re
all going to be in real trouble.

Candy, there ' s no doubt that world demand ' s gone up, but our production
is going up, and we ' re using oil more efficiently. And very little of
what Governor Romney just said is true. We ' ve opened up public lands. We ' re
actually drilling more on public lands than in the previous administration
and my — the previous president was an oil man. And natural gas
isn ' t just appearing magically. We ' re encouraging it and working with the
industry. And when I hear Governor Romney say he ' s a big coal guy, I
mean, keep in mind, when — Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts,
you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, " This plant
kills, " and took great pride in shutting it down. And now suddenly you ' re a
big champion of coal . So what I ' ve tried to do is be consistent. With
respect to something like coal , we made the largest investment in
clean coal technology, to make sure that even as we ' re producing more
coal , we ' re producing it cleaner and smarter. Same thing with
oil , same thing with natural gas . And the proof is our oil
imports are down to the lowest levels in 20 years. Oil production
is up, natural gas production is up, and, most importantly, we ' re
also starting to build cars that are more efficient. And that ' s creating
jobs. That means those cars can be exported , ' cause that ' s the demand
around the world, and it also means that it ' ll save money in your pocketbook.
That ' s the strategy you need, an all-of-the-above strategy, and that ' s what
we ' re going to do in the next four years.

Governor Carter skims over a very serious and a very broad subject. In January
of uh – 1975 I submitted to the Congress and to the American people the first
comprehensive energy program recommended by any president. It called
for an increase in the production of energy in the United States. It
called for uh – conservation measures so that we would save the energy
that we have. If you ' re going to increase domestic oil and gas
production – and we have to – you have to give those producers an
opportunity to uh – develop their land or their wells. I recommended to the
Congress that we should increase production in this country from six
hundred million tons a year to twel- a- a billion two hundred million tons by
1985 . In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from
the ground; we have to improve our utilization of coal – make it more
efficient, make it cleaner . In addition we uh – have to expand our
research and development. In my program for energy independence we have
increased, for example, solar energy research from about $84
million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year. We ' re
going as fast as the experts say we should. In nuclear power we have increased
the research and development, uh – under the Energy Research and
Development Agency uh – very substantially, to insure that our ener- uh –
nuclear power plants are safer, that they are more efficient, and that we have
adequate safeguards. I think you have to have greater oil and gas
production , more coal production , more nuclear production ,
and in addition you have to have energy conservation.

Well among my other experiences in the past, I ' ve – I ' ve been a nuclear
engineer, and did graduate work in this field. I think I know the – the uh
capabilities and limitations of atomic power. But the energy – uh policy
of our nation is one that uh has not yet been established under this
administration. I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an
energy policy except us. We have seen uh – the Federal Energy Agency
established, for instance. Uh – in the crisis of 1973 it was supposed to be a
temporary agency, uh now it ' s permanent, it ' s enormous, it ' s growing
every day. I think the Wall Street Journal uh reported not too long ago they
have a hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the Federal
Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people its own existence.
We ' ve got to have a – a firm way to handle the energy question. The
reorganization proposal that I have put forward is one uh first step. In
addition to that, we need to have – uh a realization that we ' ve got uh
about thirty-five years worth of oil left in the whole world. We ' re gonna
run out of oil . When Mr. Nixon made his famous uh speech on Operation
Independence we were importing about 35 percent of our oil . Now we '
ve increased that amount 25 percent. We now import about 44 percent of our
oil . We need to shift from oil to coal . We need to concentrate
our research and development effort on uh coal burning and extraction,
with safer mines, but also it ' s clean burning. We need to shift very
strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures. And
then as a last resort only, continue to use atomic power. I would certainly uh
– not cut out atomic power altogether. We can ' t afford to give up that
opportunity until later. But to the extent that we continue to use atomic
power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety
precautions were initiated and maintained. For instance, some that have been
forgotten; we need to have the reactor core – below ground level, the entire
power plant that uses atomic uh – power tightly sealed and a heavy – heavy
vacuum maintained. There ought to be a standardized design. There ought to be a
full-time uh – atomic energy specialist, independent of the power company
in the control room, full time, twenty-four hours a day, to shut down a plant
if an abnormality develops. These kinds of uh – procedures, along with
evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated. So, shift
from oil to coal , emphasize research and development on coal
use and also on solar power, strict conservation measures, not yield every
time that the special interest groups uh – put pressure on the president like
uh this administration has done, and use atomic energy only as a last
resort with the strictest possible safety precautions. That ' s the best
overall energy policy in the brief time we have to discuss it.

Well, I believe that conservation, at course, is worthy in and of itself.
Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy , that would be
fine, and I ' m for it. But I do not believe that conservation alone is the
answer to the present energy problem, because all you ' re doing then is
staving off, by a short time, the day when you would come to the end of the
energy supply. To say that we are limited, and at a dangerous point in this
country with regard to energy , I think, is to ignore the fact. The fact
is, that in today ' s oil wells, there is more oil still there than we
have so far taken out and used. But it would require what is known as secondary
or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground. And this is known oil
reserves, known supplies. There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that
have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they
have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain
probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we
drilled that first well 121 years ago. We have a coal supply that is
equal to 50 % of the world ' s coal supply, good for centuries, in this
country. I grant you that prices may go up, because as you go further and have
to go deeper, you are adding to the cost of production . We have nuclear
power, which, I believe, with the safest. the most stringent of safety
requirements, could meet our energy needs for the next couple of decades
while we go forward exploring the areas of solar power and other forms of
energy that might be renewable and that would not be exhaustible. All of
these things can be done. When you stop and think that we are only drilling
on 2 % . have leased only 2 % of the possible. possibility for oil of the
continental shelf around the United States; when you stop to think that the
government has taken over 100 million acres of land out of circulation in
Alaska, alone, that is believed by geologists to contain much in the line of
minerals and energy sources , then I think it is the Government, and
the Government with its own restrictions and regulations, that is creating
the energy crisis. That we are, indeed, an energy-rich nation.

Yes, Senator McCain does support this. The chant is " drill , baby,
drill . " And that ' s what we hear all across this country in our rallies
because people are so hungry for those domestic sources of energy to be
tapped into. They know that even in my own energy-producing state we have
billions of barrels of oil and hundreds of trillions of cubic feet of
clean , green natural gas . And we ' re building a nearly $40
billion natural gas pipeline which is North America ' s largest and
most you expensive infrastructure project ever to flow those sources of
energy into hungry markets . Barack Obama and Senator Biden, you ' ve
said no to everything in trying to find a domestic solution to the energy
crisis that we ' re in. You even called drilling — safe,
environmentally-friendly drilling offshore as raping the outer continental
shelf. There — with new technology, with tiny footprints even on land, it is
safe to drill and we need to do more of that. But also in that " all of the
above " approach that Senator McCain supports, the alternative fuels will be
tapped into: the nuclear, the clean coal . I was surprised to hear you
mention that because you had said that there isn ' t anything — such a thing
as clean coal . And I think you said it in a rope line, too, at one of
your rallies.

No, actually, I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these
issues. Obviously, I disagree with this notion that somehow we did not
forcefully object to Russians going into Georgia. I immediately said that this
was illegal and objectionable. And, absolutely, I wanted a cessation of the
violence, because it put an enormous strain on Georgia, and that ' s why I was
the first to say that we have to rebuild the Georgian economy and called for a
billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild. Because part of
Russia ' s intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where
President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody
that Putin favored more. Two points I think are important to think about when
it comes to Russia. Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some
of these problems. So back in April, I warned the administration that you had
Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory. That made no sense whatsoever. And
what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a
special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over. That wasn ' t done.
But had it been done, it ' s possible we could have avoided the issue. The
second point I want to make is — is the issue of energy . Russia is in
part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as
Senator McCain mentioned. That means that we, as one of the biggest consumers
of oil — 25 percent of the world ' s oil — have to have an
energy strategy not just to deal with Russia, but to deal with many of the
rogue states we ' ve talked about, Iran, Venezuela. And that means, yes,
increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3
percent of the world ' s oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world '
s oil . So we can ' t simply drill our way out of the problem. What we
' re going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy ,
like solar , and wind , and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy ,
clean-coal technology. And, you know, I ' ve got a plan for us to make a
significant investment over the next 10 years to do that. And I have to
say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy , but
Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record. Over 26
years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy , like
solar , and wind , and biodiesel. And so we — we — we ' ve got to
walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy
independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our
economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump — and, you know,
winter ' s coming and home heating oil — as it is our national security
and the issue of climate change that ' s so important.

Absolutely. I think it ' s such a great question, because energy is under
siege by the Obama administration. Under absolutely siege. The EPA,
Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies. And
foreign companies are now coming in buying our—buying so many of our
different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of
their oil . We are killing—absolutely killing our energy business in
this country. Now, I ' m all for alternative forms of energy , including
wind , including solar , et cetera. But we need much more than wind
and solar . And you look at our miners. Hillary Clinton wants to put all
the miners out of business. There is a thing called clean coal .
Coal will last for 1 , 000 years in this country. Now we have natural
gas and so many other things because of technology. We have
unbelievable—we have found over the last seven years, we have found
tremendous wealth right under our feet. So good. Especially when you have
$20 trillion in debt. I will bring our energy companies back. They ' ll be
able to compete. They ' ll make money. They ' ll pay off our national debt.
They ' ll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous. But we
are putting our energy companies out of business. We have to bring back our
workers. You take a look at what ' s happening to steel and the cost of steel
and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which
essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies. We have to
guard our energy companies. We have to make it possible. The EPA is so
restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business. And
all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like
Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they '

Well I would first say he should have been tackling it for the last seven
years. Secondly the difference is we need to explore at home. And the vice
president doesn ' t believe in exploration in Alaska. There ' s a lot of
shut-in gas that we need to be moving out of Alaska by pipeline. There ' s
an interesting issue up in the northwest as well. Do we remove dams that
produce hydroelectric energy ? I ' m against removing dams in the
northwest. I donâ€ trade_mark_e t know where the vice president stands but
thatâ€ trade_mark_e s a renewable energy source of energy . We
need to keep that in line. I was in coal country in West Virginia
yesterday. There is an abundant supply of coal in America. I know we can do
a better job of clean coal technologies. I ' m going to ask the
Congress for $2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal
technologies in the world. My answer to you is in the short-term we need to get
after it here in America. We need to explore our resources and we need to
develop our reservoirs of domestic production . We also need to have a
hemispheric energy policy where Canada, Mexico and the United States come
together. I brought this up recently with Vincent Fox the newly elected
president in Mexico, he ' s a man I know from Mexico. I talked to him about how
best to expedite the exploration of natural gas in Mexico and transport
it up to the United States so we become less dependent on foreign sources
of crude oil . This is a major problem facing America. The administration
did not deal with it. It ' s time for a new administration to deal with the
energy problem.

This is an area, again, where I think again Joe and I have fairly significant
disagreements. My assessment is that there is no comprehensive energy
policy today. That as a nation, we are in trouble because the administration
has not addressed these issues. We have the prospects of brownouts in
California. We have a potential home heating oil crisis in the northeast.
We have gasoline price rises in various other places. For years now the
administration has talked about reducing our dependence on foreign sources
of oil , but they haven ' t done it. In fact, we ' ve gone exactly in the
opposite direction. We have the lowest rate of domestic production of
oil now in 46 years. You have to go back to 1954 to find a time when we
produced as little oil as we do today. Our imports are at an all-time
record high. In June we imported almost 12 million barrels of oil a
day. That means we are more subject to the wide fluctuations and swings in
price. We have other problems. We don ' t have refinery capacity. We haven ' t
built a new refinery in this country for over ten years. They ' re operating at
96 % or 97 % capacity. Even with more crude available they ' re probably not
going to be able to do very much by way of producing additional home heating
oil for this winter. We have a growing problem with our growing dependence
on foreign sources of energy . That will allways be the case but we
ought to be able to shift the trend and begin to move it in the right
direction. We need to do a lot more about generating the capacity for power
here at home. We need to get on with the business and we think we can do it
very safely in an environmentally sound manner. We don ' t think we ought to
buy into this false choice that somehow we cannot develop energy resources
without being cautious with the environment. We can. We have the technology to
do it and we ought to do it. We do support the low income energy assistance
program. We think it ' s important that senior citizens don ' t suffer this
winter, but we need to get on to the business of having a plan to develop our
domestic energy resources in producing more supplies, and this
administration hasn ' t produced them.

Jeremy, first of all, your future is bright . And the fact that you ' re
making an investment in higher education is critical. Not just to you, but
to the entire nation. Now, the most important thing we can do is to make sure
that we are creating jobs in this country. But not just jobs, good paying
jobs. Ones that can support a family. And what I want to do, is build on the
five million jobs that we ' ve created over the last 30 months in the
private sector alone. And there are a bunch of things we can do to make
sure your future is bright . Number one, I want to build manufacturing jobs
in this country again. Now when Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go
bankrupt. I said we ' re going to bet on American workers and the American auto
industry and it ' s come surging back. I want to do that in industries, not
just in Detroit, but all across the country and that means we change our tax
code so we ' re giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the
United States and creating jobs here. It also means we ' re helping them
and small businesses to export all around the world to new markets .
Number two, we ' ve got to make sure that we have the best education system in
the world. And the fact that you ' re going to college is great, but I want
everybody to get a great education and we ' ve worked hard to make sure that
student loans are available for folks like you, but I also want to make
sure that community colleges are offering slots for workers to get retrained
for the jobs that are out there right now and the jobs of the future. Number
three, we ' ve got to control our own energy . Now, not only oil and
natural gas , which we ' ve been investing in; but also, we ' ve got to
make sure we ' re building the energy source of the future, not just
thinking about next year, but ten years from now, 20 years from now. That ' s
why we ' ve invested in solar and wind and biofuels, energy
efficient cars. We ' ve got to reduce our deficit, but we ' ve got to do it in
a balanced way. Asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more along with cuts
so that we can invest in education like yours. And let ' s take the money that
we ' ve been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild America, roads,
bridges schools. We do those things, not only is your future going to be
bright but America ' s future is going to bright as well.

Not enough, but this administration and Vice President Gore and I have had both
a long-term strategy to develop energy independence and a short-term
strategy. In fact, if the — this administration had been given the amount of
funding that it had requested from the Republican Congress, we would be further
along in the implementation of that long-term strategy aimed at developing
cleaner sources of energy , giving tax credits to individuals and
businesses to conserve and use energy more efficiently. Aimed at a
partnership for a new generation of vehicles with the American automobile
industry which is making great progress and can produce a vehicle that can get
80 miles per gallon. We also have a short-term strategy. To deal with exactly
the kind of ups and downs of energy prices. I know it was controversial,
but Al Gore and I believed it was important in the short-term to reach into the
strategic petroleum reserve, take some of the oil we have, put it in the
market , show the big oil companies and the OPEC oil-producing
countries that weâ€ trade_mark_e ve got some resources with which we can
fight back. We aren ' t going to lay back and let them roll over our economy.
We did it also because gasoline prices were rising and home heating oil
inventories were real low. Both of our tickets agree on LIHEAP keeping the low
income housing assistance program, but our opponents offer no assistance to
middle-class families hit by rising gas prices and a shortage of home
heating oil . The fact is that since the reserve was opened the price of
oil on world markets has dropped $6 a barrel. That ' s a good result

Excellent question. And here is the simple difference. My plan has not only a
short-term component, but also a long-term component. And it focuses not only
on increasing the supply, which I think we have to do, but also on working on
the consumption side. Now, in the short-term we have to free ourselves from the
domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the
price from OPEC when they want to raise the price. And in the long-term we have
to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep
gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil , but also
renewable sources of energy . And domestic sources that are
cleaner and better. And I ' m proposing a plan that will give tax credits
and tax incentives for the rapid development of new kinds of cars and trucks
and buses and factories and boilers and furnaces that don ' t have as much
pollution, that don ' t burn as much energy , and that help us get out on
the cutting edge of the new technologies that will create millions of new
jobs. Because, when we sell these new products here, we ' ll then be able to
sell them overseas. There is a ravenous demand for them overseas. Now, another
big difference is Governor Bush is proposing to open up some of our most
precious environmental treasures, like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
for the big oil companies to go in and start producing oil there. I
think that is the wrong choice. It would only give us a few months ' worth of
oil and the oil wouldn ' t start flowing for many years into the
future. I don ' t think it ' s a fair price to pay to destroy precious parts of
America ' s environment. We have to bet on the future and move beyond the
current technologies to have a whole new generation of more efficient,
cleaner , energy technology.

I think that in ten years, we can reduce our dependence so that we no longer
have to import oil from the Middle East or Venezuela. I think that ' s
about a realistic timeframe. And this is the most important issue that our
future economy is going to face. Obviously, we ' ve got an immediate crisis
right now. But nothing is more important than us no longer borrowing $700
billion or more from China and sending it to Saudi Arabia. It ' s mortgaging
our children ' s future. Now, from the start of this campaign, I ' ve
identified this as one of my top priorities and here is what I think we have to
do. Number one, we do need to expand domestic production and that means,
for example, telling the oil companies the 68 million acres that they
currently have leased that they ' re not drilling , use them or lose them.
And I think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way
that allows us to get some additional oil . But understand, we only have
three to four percent of the world ' s oil reserves and we use 25 percent
of the world ' s oil , which means that we can ' t drill our way out of
the problem. That ' s why I ' ve focused on putting resources into solar ,
wind , biodiesel, geothermal. These have been priorities of mine since I
got to the Senate, and it is absolutely critical that we develop a high fuel
efficient car that ' s built not in Japan and not in South Korea, but built
here in the United States of America. We invented the auto industry and the
fact that we have fallen so far behind is something that we have to work on.
Now I just want to make one last point because Senator McCain mentioned NAFTA
and the issue of trade and that actually bears on this issue. I believe in
free trade . But I also believe that for far too long, certainly during the
course of the Bush administration with the support of Senator McCain, the
attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement.
And NAFTA doesn ' t have — did not have enforceable labor agreements and
environmental agreements. And what I said was we should include those and
make them enforceable. In the same way that we should enforce rules against
China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and
their exports to us cheaper. And when it comes to South Korea, we ' ve got
a trade agreement up right now, they are sending hundreds of thousands of
South Korean cars into the United States. That ' s all good. We can only get 4
, 000 to 5 , 000 into South Korea. That is not free trade . We ' ve got to
have a president who is going to be advocating on behalf of American businesses
and American workers and I make no apology for that.

This is one of the biggest challenges of our times. And it is absolutely
critical that we understand this is not just a challenge, it ' s an
opportunity, because if we create a new energy economy, we can
create five million new jobs, easily, here in the United States. It can be
an engine that drives us into the future the same way the computer was the
engine for economic growth over the last couple of decades. And we can do it,
but we ' re going to have to make an investment . The same way the computer
was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to
figure out, for defense purposes, how to communicate, we ' ve got to understand
that this is a national security issue, as well. And that ' s why we ' ve got
to make some investments and I ' ve called for investments in solar
, wind , geothermal. Contrary to what Senator McCain keeps on saying, I
favor nuclear power as one component of our overall energy mix. But this is
another example where I think it is important to look at the record. Senator
McCain and I actually agree on something. He said a while back that the big
problem with energy is that for 30 years, politicians in Washington haven '
t done anything. What Senator McCain doesn ' t mention is he ' s been there 26
of them. And during that time, he voted 23 times against alternative fuels, 23
times. So it ' s easy to talk about this stuff during a campaign, but it ' s
important for us to understand that it requires a sustained effort from the
next president. One last point I want to make on energy . Senator McCain
talks a lot about drilling, and that ' s important, but we have three percent
of the world ' s oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world ' s
oil . So what that means is that we can ' t simply drill our way out of
the problem. And we ' re not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis
if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global
warming. We ' re going to have to come up with alternatives, and that means
that the United States government is working with the private sector to
fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like China
that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week.
We ' ve got to make sure that we ' re giving them the energy that they need
or helping them to create the energy that they need.

That was a statement. I don ' t think the American people believe that. I will
fight for oil , coal and natural gas . And the proof, the proof
of whether a strategy is working or not is what the price is that you ' re
paying at the pump. If you ' re paying less than you paid a year or two ago,
why, then, the strategy is working. But you ' re paying more. When the
president took office, the price of gasoline here in Nassau County was about $1
. 86 a gallon. Now, it ' s $4 . 00 a gallon. The price of electricity is up. If
the president ' s energy policies are working, you ' re going to see the
cost of energy come down. I will fight to create more energy in
this country, to get America energy secure. And part of that is bringing in
a pipeline of oil from Canada, taking advantage of the oil and coal
we have here, drilling offshore in Alaska, drilling offshore in
Virginia where the people want it. Those things will get us the energy we

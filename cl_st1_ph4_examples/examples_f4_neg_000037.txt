I firmly believe, uh – Mr. Kraft, that it ' s unwise for a president to 
signal in advance what uh – options he might exercise if any uhh – 
international problem arose. I think we all recall with some sadness that at uh 
– the period of the nin- late nineteen forties, early nineteen **fifties** , 
there were some indications that the United States would not include uh – 
South Korea in an area of defense. There are some who allege, I can ' t prove 
it true or untrue, that uh – such a statement uh – in effect invited the 
North Koreans to invade South Korea. It ' s a fact they did. But no president 
of the United States, in my opinion, should signal in advance to a prospective 
enemy, what his uhh – decision might be or what option he might exercise. It 
' s far better for a person sitting in the White House uh – who has a number 
of options to make certain that the uh – other side, so to speak, doesn ' t 
know precisely what you ' re going to do. And therefore, that was the reason 
that I would not uh – **identify** any particular course of action uh – 
when I responded to a question a week or so ago.

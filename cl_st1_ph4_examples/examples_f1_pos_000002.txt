Our entire premise of these **tax** **reform** **plans** is to **grow** the 
**economy** and **create** **jobs** . It ' s a **plan** that ' s estimated to 
**create** 7 million **jobs** . Now, we think that **government** taking 28 
**percent** of a **family** and **business** ' s **income** is enough. 
President Obama thinks that the **government** ought to be able to take as much 
as 44 . 8 **percent** of a **small** **business** ' s **income** . Look, if you 
**taxed** every person and successful **business** making over $250 , 000 at 
100 **percent** , it would only run the **government** for 98 days. If 
everybody who **paid** **income** **taxes** last year, including successful 
**small** **businesses** , doubled their **income** **taxes** this year, we ' d 
still have a $300 **billion** **deficit** . You see? There aren ' t enough rich 
**people** and **small** **businesses** to **tax** to **pay** for all their 
**spending** . And so the next time you hear them say, " Don ' t worry about 
it, we ' ll get a few **wealthy** **people** to **pay** their **fair** share, " 
watch out, **middle** **class** , the **tax** **bill** ' s coming to you. That 
' s why we ' re saying we need fundamental **tax** **reform** . Let ' s take a 
look at it this way. Eight out of 10 **businesses** , they file their **taxes** 
as individuals, not as corporations. And where I come from, overseas, which is 
Lake Superior, the Canadians, they dropped their **tax** **rates** to 15 
**percent** . The average **tax** **rate** on **businesses** in the 
industrialized world is 25 **percent** , and the president wants the top 
effective **tax** **rate** on successful **small** **businesses** to go above 
40 **percent** . Two-thirds of our **jobs** come from **small** **businesses** 
. This one **tax** would actually **tax** about 53 **percent** of 
small-business **income** . It ' s expected to **cost** us 710 , 000 **jobs** . 
And you know what? It doesn ' t even **pay** for 10 **percent** of their 
**proposed** **deficit** **spending** **increases** . What we are saying is, 
**lower** **tax** **rates** across the board and close loopholes, primarily to 
the higher-income **people** . We have three bottom lines: Don ' t **raise** 
the **deficit** , don ' t **raise** **taxes** on the **middle** **class** , and 
don ' t lower the share of **income** that is borne by the high-income earners. 
He ' ll keep saying this $5 trillion **plan** , I suppose. It ' s been 
discredited by six other studies. And even their own deputy campaign manager 
acknowledged that it wasn ' t correct.

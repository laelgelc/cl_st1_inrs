That is not so, but because that ' s just a quick answer, I want to talk about, 
again, my record on **energy** versus your ticket ' s **energy** ticket, also. 
I think that this is important to come back to, with that **energy** policy 
plan again that was voted for in ' 05 . When we talk about **energy** , we have 
to consider the need to do all that we can to allow this nation to become 
**energy** independent. It ' s a nonsensical position that we are in when we 
have domestic supplies of **energy** all over this great land. And East Coast 
politicians who don ' t allow energy-producing states like Alaska to produce 
these, to tap into them, and instead we ' re relying on foreign countries to 
produce for us. We ' re circulating about $700 billion a year into foreign 
countries, some who do not like America — they certainly don ' t have our 
best interests at heart — instead of those dollars circulating here, 
**creating** tens of thousands of jobs and allowing domestic supplies of 
**energy** to be tapped into and start flowing into these very, very hungry 
**markets** . **Energy** independence is the key to this nation ' s future, to 
our economic future, and to our national security. So when we talk about 
**energy** plans, it ' s not just about who got a tax break and who didn ' t. 
And we ' re not giving **oil** companies tax breaks, but it ' s about a heck of 
a lot more than that. **Energy** independence is the key to America ' s future.

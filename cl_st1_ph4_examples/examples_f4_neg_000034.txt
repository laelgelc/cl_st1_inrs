Senator Bentsen, you know that I did not vote to cut Social Security benefits 
eight times. What I have voted for and what Senator Bentsen has voted for is to 
delay the cost-of-living adjustments. Senator Bentsen two times in the United 
States Senate voted to delay the cost-of-living adjustments. The governor of 
Massachusetts at a governors ' **conference** supported a **resolution** to 
delay the cost-of-living adjustment. And, John, you are right: they use this 
for political advantage. What they try to do time and time again is to scare 
the old people of this country. That ' s the politics of the past. In 1983 
Republicans and Democrats dropped their political swords and in a bipartisan 
effort saved the Social Security system. Republicans and Democrats banded 
together because we know that this program is not a Republican program, it ' s 
not a Democrat program â€“ it ' s a program for older Americans. And that 
program is actuarially sound to the turn of this century.

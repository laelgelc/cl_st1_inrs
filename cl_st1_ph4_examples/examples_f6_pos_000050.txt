Yes, but they didn ' t fund the mandates that they put on the **schools** all 
over this country. That ' s the reason 800 **teachers** — one of the reasons 
— 800 **teachers** have been laid off, right here in Cleveland. One-third of 
our **public** **schools** are failing under this administration. Half of 
African-Americans are dropping out of high **school** . Half of 
Hispanic-American are dropping out of high **school** . John and I have — and 
I don ' t have the time now — but we have a clear plan to improve our 
**public** **schools** that starts with getting our best **teachers** into the 
**schools** where we need them the most by creating incentives for them to go 
there.

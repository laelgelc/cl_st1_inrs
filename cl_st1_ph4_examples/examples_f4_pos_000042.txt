Yeah, no question about that, but there also needs to be strong **enforcement** 
of the **law** . Some **kid** who feels like â€” doesn ' t matter where the 
**gun** comes from, it could be a cheap **gun** , expensive **gun** . What 
matters is something in this person ' s head says there is not going to be a 
consequence. So in my state we toughen up the juvenile **justice** **laws** . 
We added beds. We ' re tough. We believe in tough love. We say, if you get 
caught carrying a **gun** , you ' re automatically detained. And that ' s what 
needs to happen. We ' ve got **laws** . If **laws** need to be strengthened, 
like instant **background** **checks** , that ' s important.

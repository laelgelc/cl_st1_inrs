Well, Gwen, it ' s hard to know where to start; there are so many inaccuracies 
there. The fact of the matter is the **troops** wouldn ' t have what they have 
today if you guys had had your way. You talk about internationalizing the 
effort. They don ' t have a plan. Basically, it ' s an echo. You made the 
comment that the Gulf **War** coalition in ' 91 was far stronger than this. No. 
We had 34 countries then; we ' ve got 30 today. We ' ve got **troops** beside 
us. It ' s hard, after John Kerry referred to our **allies** as a coalition of 
the coerced and the bribed, to go out and persuade people to send **troops** 
and to participate in this **process** . You end up with a **situation** in 
which — talk about demeaning. In effect, you demean the sacrifice of our 
**allies** when you say it ' s the wrong **war** , wrong place, wrong time, and 
oh, by the way, send **troops** . Makes no sense at all. It ' s totally 
inconsistent. There isn ' t a plan there. Our most important **ally** in the 
**war** on terror, in Iraq specifically, is Prime Minister Allawi. He came 
recently and addressed a joint session of Congress that I presided over with 
the speaker of the House. And John Kerry rushed out immediately after his 
speech was over with, where he came and he thanked America for our 
contributions and our sacrifice and pledged to hold those elections in January, 
went out and demeaned him, criticized him, challenged his **credibility** . 
That is not the way to win friends and **allies** . You ' re never going to add 
to the coalition with that kind of attitude. IFILL: Senator Edwards, 30 
seconds.

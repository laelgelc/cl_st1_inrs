Let me say first of all, I ' m all for **students** having more choices. We ' 
ve worked hard to expand **public** **school** choice in my balanced budget 
bill. There ' s funds for 3 , 000 new **schools** created by **teachers** and 
**parents** , sometimes by business people, called charter **schools** that 
have no rules, they ' re free of bureaucracy and can only stay in existence if 
they perform and teach children. The ones that are out there are doing well. 
What I ' m against is Senator Dole ' s plan to take money away from all the 
children we now help with limited Federal funds and help far fewer. If we ' re 
going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be done at the **local** 
level or the state level. But Senator Dole has consistently opposed Federal 
help to **education** . He voted against **student** loans; he voted against my 
improved **student** loan plan; he voted against the National Service bill, 
against the HeadStart bill; he voted against our efforts in safe and drug-free 
**schools** . He voted against these programs, he does not believe it. That ' s 
the issue. 90 percent of our **kids** are out there in those **public** 
**schools** and we need to lift their standards and move them forward with the 
programs like those I ' ve outlined in this campaign.

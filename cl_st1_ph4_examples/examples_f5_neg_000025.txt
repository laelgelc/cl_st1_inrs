Which is — which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and — and 
lay down a piece of legislation and say, " It ' s my way or the highway, " I 
don ' t get a lot done. What I do is the same way that Tip O ' Neill and Ronald 
Reagan worked together some years ago. When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he 
laid out the principles that he was going to foster. He said he was going to 
lower tax rates. He said he was going to broaden the base. You ' ve said the 
same thing, you ' re going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base. Those 
are my principles. I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income 
families. And I ' m going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what — 
what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance? One 
way, for instance, would be to have a single number. Make up a number, $25 , 
000 , $50 , 000 . Anybody can have deductions up to that amount. And then that 
number disappears for high-income people. That ' s one way one could do it. One 
could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make 
differences that way. There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I 
have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and 
create incentives for growth. And with regards to health care, you had 
remarkable details with regards to my pre-existing **condition** plan. You 
obviously studied up on — on my plan. In fact, I do have a plan that deals 
with people with pre-existing **conditions** . That ' s part of my health care 
plan. And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by 
state. And I said that at that time. The federal government taking over health 
care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives 
states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to 
have a stronger, more vibrant economy.

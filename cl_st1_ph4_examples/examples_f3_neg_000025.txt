The uh – description just made of this administration ' s record is hard to 
uh – recognize. I think it ' s accurate to say that Mr. Ford voted against 
the uh – Voting Rights Acts and the uh – Civil Rights Acts in their uh – 
debative stage I think once it was assured they were going to pass he finally 
voted for it. This country uh – changed drastically in 1969 when the uh – 
terms of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were over and Richard Nixon and – 
and Gerald Ford became the presidents. There was a time when there was hope for 
those who uh – were poor and downtrodden and who were – uh elderly or who 
were – uh ill or who were in minority groups, but that time has been gone. I 
think the greatest thing that ever happened to the South was the passage of the 
Civil Rights Act and the opening up of opportunities – uh to **black** people 
– the chance to vote, to hold a job, to buy a house, to go to school, and to 
participate in public affairs. It not only liberated – uh **black** people 
but it also liberated the whites. We ' ve seen uh – in many instances in 
recent years a minority affairs uh – section of uh Small Loan Administration, 
uh – Small Business Administration lend uh – a **black** entrepreneur just 
enough money to get started, and then to go bankrupt. The bankruptcies have 
gone up – uh in an extraordinary degree. Uh – FHA, which used to be a very 
responsible agency, uh – that everyone looked to to help own a home, lost six 
million dollars last year. There ' ve been over thirteen hundred indictments in 
HUD, over eight hundred convictions relating just to home loans. And now the 
**federal** government has become the world ' s greatest slum landlord. We ' ve 
got a 30 percent or 40 percent unemployment rate among minority uh – young 
people. And there ' s been no concerted effort given to the needs of those who 
are both poor and **black** , or poor and who speak a foreign language. And 
that ' s where there ' s been a great uh generation of despair, and ill health, 
and the lack of education, lack of purposefulness, and the lack of hope for the 
future. But it doesn ' t take just a quiet uh – dormant uh **minimum** 
enforcement of the law. It requires an aggressive searching out and reaching 
out to help people who especially need it. And that ' s been lacking in the 
last eight years.

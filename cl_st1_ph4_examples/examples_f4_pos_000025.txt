Well, I ' m not for photo licensing. Let me say something about Columbine. 
Listen, we ' ve got **gun** **laws** . He says we ought to have gun-free 
schools. Everybody believes that. I ' m sure every state in the union has got 
them. You can ' t carry a **gun** into a school. And there ought to be a 
consequence when you do carry a **gun** into a school. But Columbine spoke to a 
larger issue. It ' s really a matter of culture. It ' s a culture that 
somewhere along the line we ' ve begun to disrespect **life** . Where a 
**child** can walk in and have their heart turned dark as a result of being on 
the Internet and walk in and decide to take somebody else ' s **life** ? So 
**gun** **laws** are important, no question about it, but so is loving 
**children** , and character education classes, and faith-based programs being 
a part of after-school programs. Some desperate **child** needs to have 
somebody put their **arm** around them and say, we love you. So there ' s a — 
this is a society that — of ours that ' s got to do a better job of teaching 
**children** right from wrong. And we can enforce **law** . But there seems to 
be a lot of preoccupation on — not certainly only in this debate, but just in 
general on **law** . But there ' s a larger **law** . Love your neighbor like 
you would like to be loved yourself. And that ' s where our society must head 
if we ' re going to be a peaceful and prosperous society.

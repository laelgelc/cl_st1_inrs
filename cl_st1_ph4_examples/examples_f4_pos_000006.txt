Uh – Mr. Maynard, uh – the record of **gun** control, whether it ' s one 
city or another or in some states, does not show that the registration of a 
**gun** , handgun, or the registration of the **gun** owner, has in any way 
whatsoever decreased the **crime** rate or the use of that **gun** in the 
committing of a **crime** . The record just doesn ' t prove that such 
legislation or action by a local city council is effective. What we have to do, 
and this is the crux of the matter, is to make it very, very uh – difficult 
for a person who uses a **gun** in the commission of a **crime** to stay out of 
**jail** . If we make the use of a **gun** in the commission. of a **crime** a 
serious **criminal** offense, and that person is prosecuted, then, in my 
opinion, we are going after the person who uses the **gun** for the wrong 
reason. I don ' t believe in the registration of handguns or the registration 
of the handgun owner. That has not proven to be effective, and therefore, I 
think the better way is to go after the **criminal** , the individual who 
commits a **crime** in the possession of a **gun** and uses that **gun** for a 
part of his **criminal** activity. Those are the people who ought to be in 
**jail** . And the only way to do it is to pass strong legislation so that once 
apprehended, indicted, convicted, they ' ll be in **jail** and off the 
**streets** and not using **guns** in the commission of a **crime** .

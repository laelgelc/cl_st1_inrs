I would say to that person exactly what I will say to you right now. First of 
all, I cannot tell you how deeply I respect the **belief** about life and when 
it begins. I ' m a Catholic, raised a Catholic. I was an altar boy. 
**Religion** has been a huge part of my life. It helped lead me through a war, 
leads me today. But I can ' t take what is an article of faith for me and 
legislate it for someone who doesn ' t share that article of faith, whether 
they be agnostic, atheist, Jew, Protestant, whatever. I can ' t do that. But I 
can counsel people. I can talk reasonably about life and about responsibility. 
I can talk to people, as my wife Teresa does, about making other choices, and 
about abstinence, and about all these other things that we ought to do as a 
responsible **society** . But as a president, I have to represent all the 
people in the nation. And I have to make that judgment. Now, I believe that you 
can take that position and not be pro- **abortion** , but you have to afford 
people their **constitutional** rights. And that means being smart about 
allowing people to be fully educated, to know what their options are in life, 
and making certain that you don ' t deny a poor person the right to be able to 
have whatever the constitution affords them if they can ' t afford it 
otherwise. That ' s why I think it ' s important. That ' s why I think it ' s 
important for the United States, for instance, not to have this rigid 
ideological restriction on helping families around the world to be able to make 
a smart decision about family planning. You ' ll help prevent AIDS. You ' ll 
help prevent unwanted children, unwanted pregnancies. You ' ll actually do a 
better job, I think, of passing on the moral responsibility that is expressed 
in your question. And I truly respect it.

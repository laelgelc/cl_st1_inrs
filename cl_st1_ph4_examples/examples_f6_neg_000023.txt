Senator Bentsen is the number one PAC raiser. As a matter of fact, he used to 
have a $10 , 000 breakfast club. $10 , 000 breakfast club. It only costs high 
paid lobbyists, special interests in Washington, to come down and have 
breakfast with the Chairman of the Senate Finance **Committee** , the one that 
oversees all the tax loopholes in the tax code, $10 , 000 . I ' m sure they 
weren ' t paying to have cornflakes. Well, I ' ll tell you the kind of campaign 
reform I ' m supporting, Senator Bentsen. I think it ' s time we get rid of PAC 
money. Support our legislation where we totally eliminate contributions by 
special interests and political action **committees** , and let ' s have the 
individual contribute and the political **parties** contribute. That ' s the 
kind of campaign reform that Republicans are for. They want to get rid of this 
special interest and rely on the individuals, and also, the political 
**parties** .

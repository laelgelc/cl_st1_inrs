Mr. Lehrer, I hope we ' ll have a chance to discuss drugs later in the program. 
But let me respond to what you said. I agree that too many incumbent 
politicians in Washington in both **parties** have consistently opposed 
campaign finance reform. That was certainly the case from the minute I got 
there. So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I 
went to New Hampshire and a man suggested â€” a gentleman that unfortunately 
just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission. 
And I shook hands with him on it and I appointed my members, and the commission 
never met. And then Senator Dole ' s ardent supporters, Senator McCain, who ' s 
out there today, along with Senator Feingold, supported, **sponsored** a 
campaign finance reform proposal. I strongly supported it. And members of 
Senator Dole ' s own **party** in the Senate killed it. And he was not out 
there urging them to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill. So I think the American 
people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a consistent 
record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have. And I 
hope we can finally get it in the next session of Congress, because we need it 
badly.

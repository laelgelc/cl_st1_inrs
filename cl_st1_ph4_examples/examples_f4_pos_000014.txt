I don ' t believe so, and I ' ve talked with Breonna ' s **mother** , Tamika 
Palmer, and her family, and her family deserves **justice** . She was a 
beautiful young woman. She had as her **life** goal to become a nurse, and she 
wanted to become an EMT to first learn what ' s going on out on the **street** 
, so she could then become a nurse and save **lives** . And her **life** was 
taken, unjustifiably and tragically and violently. And it just, it brings me 
to, you know, the eight minutes and 46 seconds that America witnessed, during 
which an American man was tortured and **killed** under the knee of an armed, 
uniformed **police** **officer** . And people around our country, of every 
race, of every age, of every gender – perfect strangers to each other – 
marched shoulder to shoulder, **arm** and **arm** , fighting for us to finally 
achieve that ideal of equal **justice** under **law** . And I was a part of

need **reform** of our **policing** in America and our **criminal** **justice** 
system, which is why Joe and I will immediately **ban** chokeholds and carotid 
holds. George Floyd would be alive today if we did that. We will require a 
national registry for **police** **officers** who break the **law** , we will 
– on the issue of **criminal** **justice** **reform** – get rid of private 
prisons and cash bail and we will decriminalize marijuana, and we will expunge 
the records of those who have been convicted of marijuana. This is a time for 
leadership. On a tragic, tragic issue …

Is this the time to unleash our one-liners? That answer was about as clear as 
Boston harbor. ( Laughter ) Let me help the governor. There are so many things 
there, I don ' t quite know where to begin. When you cut capital **gains** , 
you put people to work. John Kennedy proposed cutting capital **gains** . Paul 
Tsongas, a liberal senator from Massachusetts said the dumbest thing I did was 
to oppose the capital **gains** cut. It ' s not going to cost the government 
money. It ' s going to increase revenues to the federal government, and it ' s 
going to create jobs. So that ' s one of the things that I think makes a big 
difference between us. Massachusetts doesn ' t have an enormous defense budget, 
but nevertheless, the governor raised taxes five different times. That happens 
to be a fact. And so let ' s kind of stay on the issue, and I have made a 
specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze. And it permits – 
economists on the East Coast and West think it ' s good – it permits the 
president to sort out the priorities, and we continue to grow because I will 
not raise taxes.

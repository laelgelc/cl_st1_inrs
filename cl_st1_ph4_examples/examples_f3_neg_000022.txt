Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President, I 
had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States. 
And so, my change had come earlier than that. I hadn ' t gotten around to 
reregistering as yet. I found that was rather difficult to do. But I finally 
did it. There are some other things that have been said here â€” back, and you 
said that I might be able to dredge them up. Mr. Mondale referred to the 
**farmers** ' worst year. The **farmers** are not the victims of anything this 
administration has done. The **farmers** were the victims of the double-digit 
inflation and the 21\1 / 2\-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale 
administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability 
nationwide as a supplier. All of these things are presently being rectified, 
and I think that we are going to salvage the **farmers** . As a matter of fact, 
there has been less than one-quarter of 1 percent of foreclosures of the 270 , 
000 loans from government that the **farmers** have.

Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment. I lived in Arkansas for 18 
wonderful years. I represented upstate New York. I understand and **respect** 
the tradition of **gun** ownership. It goes back to the founding of our 
country. But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable 
regulation. Because I support the Second Amendment doesn ' t mean that I want 
people who shouldn ' t have **guns** to be able to threaten you, **kill** you 
or members of your family. And so when I think about what we need to do, we 
have 33 , 000 people a year who die from **guns** . I think we need 
**comprehensive** **background** **checks** , need to close the online 
loophole, close the **gun** show loophole. There ' s other matters that I think 
are sensible that are the kind of **reforms** that would make a difference that 
are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment. You mentioned the 
Heller decision. And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I 
disagreed with the way the **court** applied the Second Amendment in that case, 
because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers 
from **guns** and so they wanted people with **guns** to safely store them. And 
the **court** didn ' t accept that reasonable regulation, but they ' ve 
accepted many others. So I see no conflict between saving people ' s **lives** 
and defending the Second Amendment.

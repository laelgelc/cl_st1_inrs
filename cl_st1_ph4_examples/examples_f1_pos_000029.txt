Well, Mr. Ford is – is uh changing uh considerably his previous philosophy. 
The present **tax** structure is a disgrace to this country; it ' s just a 
welfare **program** for the rich. As a matter of fact, uh – 25 **percent** of 
the total **tax** deductions, go for only 1 **percent** of the richest 
**people** in this country, and over 50 **percent** of the **tax** uh credits 
go for the 14 **percent** of the richest **people** in this country. When Mr. 
Ford first became president in – in August of 1974 , the first thing he did 
in – in October was to ask for a $4 . 7 **billion** **increase** in **taxes** 
on our **people** in the midst of the heaviest recession, since uh – since 
the great depression of nineteen uh – of the 1940s. In uh – January of 1975 
he asked for a **tax** change: a $5 . 6 **billion** **increase** on 
low-and-middle-income **private** individuals, a six and a half **billion** 
**dollar** decrease on the corporations and the special **interests** . In uh 
– December of uh – 1975 he **vetoed** the roughly 18 to 20 **billion** 
**dollar** uh tax-reduction **bill** that had been passed by the Congress, and 
then he came back later on in January of this year and he did advocate a $10 
**billion** **tax** **reduction** , but it would be offset by a $6 **billion** 
**increase** this coming January in deductions for Social Security **payments** 
and for unemployment compensation. The whole philosophy of the Republican 
party, including uh – my opponent, has been to pile on **taxes** on 
low-income **people** to take ' em off on the corporations. As a matter fact, 
in – sin- since the late sixties when Mr. Nixon took office, we ' ve had a 
**reduction** in uh – in the percentage of **taxes** **paid** by corporations 
from 30 **percent** down to about 20 **percent** . We ' ve had an **increase** 
in **taxes** **paid** by individuals, payroll **taxes** , from14 **Percent** up 
to 20 **percent** . And this is what the Republicans have done to us. And this 
is why a **tax** **reform** is so important.

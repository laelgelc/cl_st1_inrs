I ' ve had more **people** talk to me about their **health** **care** problems 
I guess than anything else, all across America — you know, **people** who ' 
ve lost their **jobs** , lost their **businesses** , had to give up their 
**jobs** because of sick children. So let me try to answer you in this way. Let 
' s start with a premise. We spend 30 % more of our **income** than any nation 
on earth on **health** **care** , and yet we insure fewer **people** . We have 
35 million **people** without any **insurance** at all — and I see them all 
the time. A hundred thousand Americans a month have lost their **health** 
**insurance** just in the last 4 years. So if you analyze where we ' re out of 
line with other countries, you come up with the following conclusions. Number 
one, we spend at least $60 **billion** a year on **insurance** , administrative 
**cost** , bureaucracy, and **government** regulation that wouldn ' t be spent 
in any other nation. So we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic 
simplification of the basic **health** **insurance** policies of this country, 
be very comprehensive for everybody. Employers would **cover** their employees, 
**government** would **cover** the unemployed. Number 2 , I think you have to 
take on specifically the **insurance** **companies** and require them to make 
some significant change in the way they **rate** **people** in the **big** 
community pools. I think you have to tell the pharmaceutical **companies** they 
can ' t keep **raising** drug prices at three times the **rate** of 
**inflation** . I think you have to take on **medical** fraud. I think you have 
to help **doctors** stop practicing defensive medicine. I ' ve **recommended** 
that our **doctors** be given a set of **national** practice guidelines and 
that if they follow those guidelines that **raises** the presumption that they 
didn ' t do anything wrong. I think you have to have a system of primary and 
preventive clinics in our inner cities and our rural areas so **people** can 
have access to **health** **care** . The key is to control the **cost** and 
maintain the quality. To do that you need a system of managed competition where 
all of us are **covered** in **big** groups and we can choose our **doctors** 
and our hospitals, a wide range, but there is an incentive to control **costs** 
. And I think there has to be — I think Mr. Perot and I agree on this, there 
has to be a **national** commission of **health** **care** providers and 
**health** **care** consumers that set ceilings to keep **health** **costs** in 
line with **inflation** , plus population **growth** . Now, let me say, some 
**people** say we can ' t do this but Hawaii does it. They **cover** 98 % of 
their **people** and their **insurance** **premiums** are much cheaper than the 
rest of America, and so does Rochester, New York. They now have a **plan** to 
**cover** everybody and their **premiums** are two-thirds of the rest of the 
country. This is very important. It ' s a **big** human problem and a 
devastating economic problem for America, and I ' m going to send a **plan** to 
do this within the first 100 days of my presidency. It ' s terribly important.

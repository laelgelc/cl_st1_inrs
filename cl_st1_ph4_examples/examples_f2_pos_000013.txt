Well I don ' t think that in the winter of sixty-one under present economic 
conditions, it uh – a – uh – tax uh – increase would be desirable. In 
fact, it would be deflationary; it would cause great unemployment; it would 
cause a real slowdown in our economy. If it ever becomes necessary, and is wise 
economically and essential to our **security** , I would have no hesitancy in 
suggesting a tax increase or any other **policy** which would **defend** the 
United **States** . I have talked in every speech about the fact that these are 
going to be very **difficult** times in the nineteen-sixties and that we ' re 
going to have to meet our **responsibilities** as **citizens** . I ' m talking 
about a **national** mood. I ' m talking about our willingness to **bear** any 
burdens in **order** to maintain our own **freedom** and in **order** to meet 
our **freedom** around the globe. We don ' t know what the **future** ' s going 
to bring. But I would not want anyone to elect me uh – **president** of the 
United **States** – or vote for me – under the expectation that life would 
be easier if I were elected. Now, many of the **programs** that I ' m talking 
about – economic growth, care for the aged, **development** of our 
**natural** resources – build the **strength** of the United **States** . 
That ' s how the United **States** began to prepare for its great **actions** 
in **World** **War** II and in the post-war period. If we ' re **moving** 
ahead, if we ' re providing a viable economy, if our **people** have sufficient 
resources so that they can consume what we produce; then this country ' s on 
the **move** , then we ' re **stronger** , then we set a **better** example to 
the **world** . So we have the problem of not only building our own uh – 
**military** **strength** and **extending** uh – our **policies** abroad, we 
have to do a job here at home. So I believe that the **policies** that I 
recommend came under the **general** heading of strengthening the United 
**States** . We ' re using our steel capacity fifty-five per cent **today** . 
We ' re not able to consume what we ' re able to produce at a time when the 
Soviet Union is making great economic gains. And all I say is, I don ' t know 
what the sixties will bring – except I think they will bring hard times in 
the uh – international sphere; I **hope** we can **move** ahead here at home 
in the United **States** ; I ' m confident we can do a far **better** job of 
mobilizing our economy and resources in the United **States** . And I merely 
say that they – if they elect me **president** , I will do my **best** to 
carry the United **States** through a **difficult** period; but I would not 
want **people** to elect me because I promised them the easy, soft life. I 
think it ' s going to be **difficult** ; but I ' m confident that this country 
can meet its **responsibilities** .

What troubles me is that when I talk of the voluntary sector and a thousand 
points of light and a thousand different ways to help on these problems, the 
man has just said he doesn ' t understand what I ' m talking about. This is the 
problem I have with the big spending liberals. They think the only way to do it 
is for the federal government to do it all. The fact happens to be that 
**education** spending is up by the federal government; it is up. It is not 
down. But here ' s the point he misses. The federal government spends seven 
percent of the total on **education** , and the rest of the state governments 
and **local** governments and the thousand points of lightened I ' m talking 
about private **schools** and private church **schools** and things of this 
nature–are putting up 93 percent. But the federal spending for **education** 
is up, and I want to be the **education** president, because I want to see us 
do better. We ' re putting more money per child into **education** , and we are 
not performing as we should. We ' ve gotten away fro values and the 
fundamentals. And I would like to urge the **school** superintendents and the 
others around the country to stand up now and keep us moving forward on a path 
towards real excellence. And we can do it. But itÏ€s not going to be 
dedicated by some federal bureaucracy in Washington, D. C.

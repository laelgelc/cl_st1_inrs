Here ' s what it means: It means that Saddam Hussein needed to be confronted. 
John Kerry and I have consistently said that. That ' s why we voted for the 
resolution. But it also means it needed to be done the right way. And doing it 
the right way meant that we were prepared; that we gave the **weapons** 
inspectors time to find out what we now know, that in fact there were no 
**weapons** of **mass** **destruction** ; that we didn ' t take our eye off the 
ball, which are Al Qaida, Osama **bin** Laden, the people who attacked us on 
September the 11th. Now, remember, we went into Afghanistan, which, by the way, 
was the right thing to do. That was the right decision. And our **military** 
performed terrifically there. But we had Osama **bin** Laden cornered at Tora 
Bora. We had the 10th Mountain Division up in Uzbekistan available. We had the 
finest **military** in the world on the ground. And what did we do? We turned 
— this is the man who masterminded the greatest **mass** murder and 
**terrorist** attack in American history. And what did the administration 
decide to do? They gave the responsibility of capturing and / or killing Saddam 
— I mean Osama **bin** Laden to Afghan warlords who, just a few weeks before, 
had been working with Osama **bin** Laden. Our point in this is not complicated 
- We were attacked by Al Qaida and Osama **bin** Laden. We went into 
Afghanistan and very quickly the administration made a decision to divert 
attention from that and instead began to plan for the invasion of Iraq. And 
these connections — I want the American people to hear this very clearly. 
Listen carefully to what the vice president is saying. Because there is no 
connection between Saddam Hussein and the attacks of September 11th — period. 
The 9 / 11 Commission has said that ' s true. Colin Powell has said it ' s 
true. But the vice president keeps suggesting that there is. There is not. And, 
in fact, any connection with Al Qaida is tenuous at best.

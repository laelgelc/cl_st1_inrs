I ' m not quite through. Let me finish. I talked about the principles and the 
issues that I think are important in a patient ' s bill of rights. It ' s kind 
of Washington, D. C. focus. Well, it ' s in this **committee** or it ' s got 
this **sponsor** . If I ' m the president, we ' re going to have emergency room 
care, we ' re going have gag orders, we ' re going to have direct access to OB 
/ GYN. People will be able to take their HMO insurance **company** to court. 
That ' s what I ' ve done in Texas and that ' s the kind of leadership style I 
' ll bring to Washington.

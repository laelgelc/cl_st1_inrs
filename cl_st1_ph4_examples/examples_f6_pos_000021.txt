Yeah, I appreciate that. I think any time we end with one of these attacks, it 
' s appropriate to respond. Here ' s what I think. First of all, vouchers are 
up to states. If you want to do a voucher program in Missouri, fine. I strongly 
believe in **local** control of **schools** . I ' m a governor of state and I 
don ' t like it when the federal government tells us what to do. I believe in 
**local** control of **schools** . But here ' s what I said. I ' ve said to the 
extent we spend federal money on disadvantaged children, we want the 
**schools** to show us whether or not the children are **learning** . What ' s 
unreasonable about that? We expect there to be standards met and we expect 
there to be measurement. And if we find success we ' ll praise it. But when we 
find children trapped in **schools** that will not change and will not teach, 
instead of saying oh, this is okay in America just to shuffle poor **kids** 
through **schools** , there has to be a **consequence** . And the 
**consequence** is that federal portion or federal money will go to the 
**parent** , so the **parent** can go to a tutoring program or another 
**public** **school** or another private **school** . You see, there has to be 
a **consequence** . We ' ve got a society that says hey, the status quo is 
fine, just move them through. And guess who suffers.

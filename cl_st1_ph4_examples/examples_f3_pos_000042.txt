Well, Mr. Ford **acts** like he ' s uh – running for president for the first 
time. He ' s been in office two years, and there has been absolutely no 
progress made toward a new SALT **agreement** . He has learned the date of the 
expiration of SALT I, apparently. We ' ve seen, in this world, a development of 
a tremendous **threat** to us. As a **nuclear** engineer myself, I know the 
limitations and capabilities of atomic power. I also – know that as far as 
the human beings on this earth are concerned that the nonproliferation of 
atomic **weapons** is number one. Only the last few days with the election 
approaching, has Mr. Ford taken any interest in a nonproliferation movement. I 
advocated last May in a speech at the United Nations that we move immediately 
as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all **nuclear** 
devices, both **weapons** and peaceful devices; that we not ship any more 
atomic fuel to a country that refuses to comply with strict controls over the 
waste which can be reprocessed into explosives. I ' ve also advocated that we 
stop the sale by Germany and France of – **processing** plants for Pakistan 
and Brazil. Mr. Ford hasn ' t moved on this. We also need to provide an 
adequate supply of enriched uranium. Mr. Ford, again, under pressure from the 
atomic energy lobby, has insisted that this reprocessing or rather re-en- 
enrichment be done by private industry and not by the existing uh – 
government uh – plants. This kind of confusion and absence of leadership has 
let us drift now for two years with a constantly increasing **threat** of 
atomic **weapons** throughout the world. We now have five nations that have 
atomic bombs that we know about. If we continue under Mr. Ford ' s policy by 
1985 or ' 90 we ' ll have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding 
atomic **weapons** . This has got to be stopped. That is one of the major 
challenges and major undertakings that I will assume as the next president.

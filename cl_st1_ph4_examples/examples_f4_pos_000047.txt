Elaine, if I could — if I could jump in. I ' ve heard Senator Scott make that 
eloquent plea. And look, **criminal** **justice** is about **respecting** the 
**law** and being **respected** by the **law** . So there is a fundamental 
**respect** issue here. And I just want to talk about the tone that ' s set 
from the top. Donald Trump during his campaign has called Mexicans rapists and 
**criminals** . He ' s called women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting. I don ' t 
like saying that in front of my wife and my **mother** . He attacked an 
Indiana-born federal judge and said he was unqualified to hear a federal 
lawsuit because his **parents** were Mexican. He went after John McCain, a POW, 
and said he wasn ' t a hero because he ' d been captured. He said 
African-Americans are living in Hell. And he perpetrated this outrageous and 
bigoted lie that President Obama is not a U. S. citizen. If you want to have a 
society where people are **respected** and **respect** **laws** , you can ' t 
have somebody at the top who demeans every group that he talks about. And I 
just — again, I cannot believe that Governor Pence will defend the 
insult-driven campaign that Donald Trump has run.

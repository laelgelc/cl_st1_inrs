No, I don ' t think there is. There are two very different issues here, and 
they ' ve got to be dealt with separately. I ' m opposed to the **death** 
**penalty** . I think everybody knows that. I ' m also very tough on violent 
**crime** . And that ' s one of the reasons why my state has cut **crime** by 
more than any other industrial state in America. It ' s one of the reasons why 
we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in the country. It ' s 
one of the reasons why we have a **drug** education and prevention program that 
is reaching out and helping youngsters all over our state, the kind of thing I 
want to do as president of the United States. You know, the vice president says 
he wants to impose the **death** **penalty** on **drug** traffickers, and yet 
his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most 
permissive in the country, which gave last year 7 , 000 furloughs to **drug** 
traffickers and **drug** pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to 
execute. The issue of abortion is a very difficult issue, one that I think that 
we all have to wrestle with, we have to come to terms with. I don ' t favor 
abortion. I don ' t think it ' s a good thing. I don ' t think most people do. 
The question is who makes the decision. And I think it has to be the woman, in 
the exercise of her own conscience and religious **beliefs** , that makes that 
decision.

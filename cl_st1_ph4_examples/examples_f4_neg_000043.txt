Mr. Cronkite, I naturally am aware of it, because I, of course, pay attention 
to everything Senator Kennedy says, as well as Senator Fulbright. Now, in this 
connection I want to point out that the facts simply aren ' t as stated. First 
of all, the report to which Senator Kennedy refers is one that was made many, 
many months ago and related particularly to the uh – period immediately after 
Sputnik. Second, as far as this report is concerned, I would have no objection 
to having it made public. Third, I would say this with regard to this report, 
with regard to Gallup Polls of prestige abroad and everything else that we ' ve 
been hearing about " what about American prestige abroad " : America ' s 
prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for America allow it to 
be. Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example – Senator Kennedy 
– stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and 
the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight 
– we ' ve had twenty-eight successful shots, they ' ve had eight; when he 
states that we ' re second in education, and I have seen **Soviet** education 
and I ' ve seen ours, and we ' re not; that we ' re second in science because 
they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we ' re way ahead of the 
**Soviet** Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in 
January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most 
crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry 
every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American 
prestige? Well, it can only have the effect certainly of reducing it. Well let 
me make one thing clear. Senator Kennedy has a responsibility to criticize 
those things that are wrong, but he has also a responsibility to be right in 
his criticism. Every one of these items that I have mentioned he ' s been wrong 
– dead wrong. And for that reason he has contributed to any lack of prestige. 
Finally, let me say this: as far as prestige is concerned, the first place it 
would show up would be in the United **Nations** . Now Senator Kennedy has 
referred to the vote on Communist China. Let ' s look at the vote on Hungary. 
There we got more votes for condemning Hungary and looking into that situation 
than we got the last year. Let ' s look at the reaction eh – reaction to 
Khrushchev and Eisenhower at the last U. N. session. Did Khrushchev **gain** 
because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted? 
Not at all. The President **gained** . America **gained** by continuing the 
dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it ' s that that keeps the 
prestige of America up, not running down America the way Senator Kennedy has 
been running her down.

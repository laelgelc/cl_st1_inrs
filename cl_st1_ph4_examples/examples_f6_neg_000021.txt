Well, the bottom line is we have to stop exporting jobs here. There are 357 , 
000 good jobs — manufacturing jobs, which are lost. And I assume some of 
those are because of our trading partners. We didn ' t have access to their 
markets. We ought to insist on access. If we don ' t have access to their 
markets the same way they ' ve access our markets, we ought to say, " Wait, 
that ' s enough. Time out. When you give us access, we ' ll give you access. " 
It ' s very hard to get into the Japan market, as everybody knows. They want to 
get into our market. They sell a lot of automobiles here, create a lot of jobs 
— those who sell exports. And that ' s very important to the economy, but I 
think we want to make certain. I supported the President ' s trade policy. But 
we got to be more aggressive. Once you have a policy, then you have to go out 
and be aggressive and enforce that policy. There are American jobs that are 
being lost. This is what Ross Perot complains about. And I ' d say to the 
Reform **party** , take a look at the Republican **party** . We ' re the reform 
**party** , and we ' re going to make things better, and one of the things we ' 
re going to do is stop exporting jobs.

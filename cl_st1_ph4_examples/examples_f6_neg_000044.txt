I do. I do think this, though. When it comes to timetables it can ' t be the 
United States timetable as to how discussions take place. It ' s got to be a 
timetable that all **parties** can agree to, like the Palestinians and 
Israelis. Secondly, any lasting peace is going to have to be a peace that ' s 
good for both sides. And therefore, the term honest broker makes sense. This 
current administration ' s worked hard to keep the **parties** at the table. I 
will try to do the same thing. But it won ' t be on my timetable, it will be on 
the timetable that people are comfortable with in the Middle East.

We ' re a nation that believes in the Second Amendment, and I believe in the 
Second Amendment. We ' ve got a long tradition of hunting and sportsmen and 
people who want to make sure they can protect themselves. But there have been 
too many instances during the course of my presidency, where I ' ve had to 
comfort families who have lost somebody. Most recently out in Aurora. You know, 
just a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably about a month, I saw a 
**mother** , who I had met at the bedside of her **son** , who had been shot in 
that theater. And her **son** had been shot through the head. And we spent some 
time, and we said a **prayer** and, remarkably, about two months later, this 
young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable, good as new. But 
there were a lot of families who didn ' t have that good fortune and whose 
**sons** or **daughters** or husbands didn ' t survive. So my **belief** is 
that, ( A ) , we have to enforce the **laws** we ' ve already got, make sure 
that we ' re keeping **guns** out of the hands of **criminals** , those who are 
mentally ill. We ' ve done a much better job in terms of **background** 
**checks** , but we ' ve got more to do when it comes to **enforcement** . But 
I also share your **belief** that weapons that were designed for soldiers in 
war theaters don ' t belong on our **streets** . And so what I ' m trying to do 
is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally. 
Part of it is seeing if we can get an **assault** weapons **ban** reintroduced. 
But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence. Because 
frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there ' s an awful lot of violence and 
they ' re not using AK-47s. They ' re using cheap hand **guns** . And so what 
can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that 
our schools are working; that if there ' s violence on the **streets** , that 
working with faith groups and **law** **enforcement** , we can catch it before 
it gets out of control. And so what I want is a — is a **comprehensive** 
strategy. Part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that **kill** 
folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of **criminals** and the mentally 
ill. But part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these 
communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur.

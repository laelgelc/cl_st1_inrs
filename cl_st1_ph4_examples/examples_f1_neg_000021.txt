Yes, it ' s very difficult to rebut, because I find myself in so much agreement 
with Mr. Mondale. I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of 
separation of church and state to remain there. The only attacks I have made 
are on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government 
side, using the government, using the power of the courts and so forth to 
hinder that part of the Constitution that says the government shall not only 
not establish a **religion** , it shall not inhibit the practice of 
**religion** . And they have been using these things to have government, 
through court orders, inhibit the practice of **religion** . A child wants to 
say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they can ' t do it 
because it ' s school property. These are they types of things that I think 
have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that 
separation, and I am opposed to that. With regard to a platform on the Supreme 
Court, I can only say one thing about that. I have appointed one member to the 
Supreme Court - Sandra Day O ' Connor. I ' ll stand on my record on that. And 
if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, I ' ll do it in the same manner 
that I did in selecting her.

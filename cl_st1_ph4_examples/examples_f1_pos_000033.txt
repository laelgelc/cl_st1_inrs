I think the fact that — that under this past administration of which Hillary 
Clinton was a part, we ' ve almost doubled the **national** debt is atrocious. 
I mean, I ' m very proud of the fact that — I come from a state that 
**works** . The state of Indiana has **balanced** **budgets** . We **cut** 
**taxes** , we ' ve made record **investments** in **education** and in 
infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 **billion** in the bank. 
That ' s a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in 
Virginia. He actually — he actually tried to **raise** **taxes** by about $4 
**billion** . He left his state about $2 **billion** in the hole. In the state 
of Indiana, we ' ve **cut** unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he 
was governor. But I think he ' s a very fitting running mate for Hillary 
Clinton, because in the wake of a season where American **families** are 
struggling in this **economy** under the weight of **higher** **taxes** and 
Obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming 
out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the 
same. It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion 
**dollars** in **tax** **increases** , which I get that. You tried to **raise** 
**taxes** here in Virginia and were unsuccessful. But a trillion **dollars** in 
**tax** **increases** , more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more 
of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a 
crazy **plan** . But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare. 
They want to expand it into a single-payer **program** . And for all the world, 
Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start. Look, Donald Trump and I 
have a **plan** to get this **economy** moving again just the way that it 
**worked** in the 1980s, just the way it **worked** in the 1960s, and that is 
by lowering **taxes** across the board for **working** **families** , **small** 
**businesses** and **family** farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting 
**jobs** and hurting this **economy** even here in Virginia, repealing 
Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders 
that Barack Obama has **signed** that are stifling economic **growth** in this 
**economy** . We can get America moving again. **Put** on top of that the kind 
of trade deals that ' ll **put** the American worker first, and you ' ve got a 
**prescription** for real **growth** . And when you get the **economy** 
growing, Elaine, that ' s when you can deal with the **national** debt. When we 
get back to 3 . 5 **percent** to 4 **percent** **growth** with Donald Trump ' s 
**plan** will do, then we ' re going to have the resources to meet our nation ' 
s needs at home and abroad, and we ' re going to have the ability to bring down 
the **national** debt.

I agree with Senator Kennedy ' s appraisal generally in this respect. The 
question of Communism within the United States has been one that has worried us 
in the past. It is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come. We 
have to remember that the cold war that Mr. Khrushchev is **waging** and his 
colleagues are **waging** , is **waged** all over the world and it ' s 
**waged** right here in the United States. That ' s why we have to continue to 
be alert. It is also essential in being alert that we be fair; fair because by 
being fair we uphold the very freedoms that the **Communists** would destroy. 
We uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow. And, in this 
connection, I think that uh – we must look to the future having in mind the 
fact that we fight Communism at home not only by our laws to deal with 
**Communists** uh – the few who do become **Communists** and the few who do 
become tra- fellow travelers, but we also fight Communism at home by moving 
against those various injustices which exist in our society which the 
**Communists** feed upon. And in that connection I again would say that while 
Senator Kennedy says we are for the status quo, I do believe that he uh – 
would agree that I am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for 
federal aid to education, my proposals for health care are just as sincerely 
held as his. The question again is not one of goals – we ' re for those goals 
– it ' s one of means.

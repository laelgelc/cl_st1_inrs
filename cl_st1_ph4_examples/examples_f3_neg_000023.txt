Yes. The President talks of Government programs, and they have their place. But 
as governor, when I was at that end of the line and receiving some of these 
grants for Government programs, I saw that so many of them were dead-end. They 
were public employment that these people who really want to get out into the 
private job market where there are jobs with a future. Now, the President spoke 
a moment ago about that I was against the **minimum** wage. I wish he could 
have been with me when I sat with a group of teenagers who were **black** , and 
who were telling me about their unemployment problems, and that it was the 
**minimum** wage that had done away with the jobs that they once could get. And 
indeed, every time it has increased you will find there is an increase in 
minority unemployment among young people. And therefore, I have been in favor 
of a separate **minimum** for them. With regard to the great progress that has 
been made with this Government spending, the rate of **black** unemployment in 
Detroit, Michigan, is 56 % .

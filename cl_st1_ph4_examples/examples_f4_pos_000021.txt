Actually, I made my intentions — made my views clear. I did think we ought to 
extend the **assault** weapons **ban** , and was told the fact that the bill 
was never going to move, because Republicans and Democrats were against the 
**assault** weapon **ban** , people of both parties. I believe law-abiding 
citizens ought to be able to own a **gun** . I believe in **background** 
**checks** at **gun** shows or anywhere to make sure that **guns** don ' t get 
in the hands of people that shouldn ' t have them. But the best way to protect 
our citizens from **guns** is to prosecute those who commit **crimes** with 
**guns** . And that ' s why early in my administration I called the attorney 
general and the U. S. attorneys and said: Put together a task force all around 
the country to prosecute those who commit **crimes** with **guns** . And the 
prosecutions are up by about 68 percent — I believe — is the number. 
Neighborhoods are safer when we crack down on people who commit **crimes** with 
**guns** . To me, that ' s the best way to secure America.

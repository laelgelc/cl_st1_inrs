To repeat myself, we have this year the opportunity, which we ' ll realize, to 
produce 800 million tons of **coal** – an unequaled record in the history of 
our country. Governor Reagan says that this is not a good achievement, and he 
blames restraints on **coal** **production** on regulations – regulations 
that affect the life and the health and safety of miners, and also regulations 
that protect the purity of our air and the quality our **water** and our land. 
We cannot cast aside these regulations. We have a chance in the next 15 years, 
insisting upon the health and safety of workers in the mines, and also 
preserving the same high air and **water** pollution standards, to triple the 
amount of **coal** we produce. Governor Reagan ' s approach to our **energy** 
policy, which has already proven its effectiveness, is to repeal, or to change 
substantially, the windfall profits tax – to return a major portion of $227 
billion back to the **oil** companies; to do away with the Department of 
**Energy** ; to short-circuit our synthetic fuels program; to put a minimal 
emphasis on **solar** power; to emphasize strongly nuclear power plants as a 
major **source** of **energy** in the future. He wants to put all our eggs in 
one basket and give that basket to the major **oil** companies.

President Clinton has made it clear that he will sign **legislation** outlawing 
procedures such as this if there is a â€” an exception to protect the health of 
the mother where serious health consequences, such as the inability to have any 
further children, are involved and her doctor advises her so. What is really at 
stake here is whether or not women will have the right to choose. The platform 
on which Mr. Kemp and Senator Dole are running pledges a **constitutional** 
**amendment** to take away a woman ' s right to choose and to have the 
government come in and order that woman to do what the government says, no 
matter what the circumstances. Mr. Kemp has voted 47 out of 47 times to have 
such an **amendment** and to restrict this completely, no matter what the 
circumstances, even where rape and incest is involved. We will never allow a 
woman ' s right to choose to be taken away.

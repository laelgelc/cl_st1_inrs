Well I think this **Republican** administration has been almost all style, and 
spectacular, and not substance. We ' ve uh – got a chance tonight to talk 
about, first of all, leadership, the character of our country, and a vision of 
the **future** . In every one of these instances, the Ford administration has 
failed, and I **hope** tonight that I and Mr. Ford will have a chance to 
discuss the reasons for those **failures** . Our country is not **strong** 
anymore; we ' re not respected anymore. We can only be **strong** overseas if 
we ' re **strong** at home; and when I became **president** we ' ll not only be 
**strong** in those areas but also in defense – a defense capability second 
to none. We ' ve lost in our **foreign** **policy** , the character of the 
**American** **people** . We ' ve uh – ignored or excluded the **American** 
**people** and the Congress from participation in the shaping of our 
**foreign** **policy** . It ' s been one of secrecy and exclusion. In addition 
to that we ' ve had a chance to became now, contrary to our long-standing 
beliefs and principles, the **arms** merchant of the whole **world** . We ' ve 
tried to buy success from our enemies, and at the same time we ' ve excluded 
from the process the normal friendship of our **allies** . In addition to that 
we ' ve become fearful to compete with the Soviet Union on an equal basis. We 
talk about detente. The Soviet Union knows what they want in detente, and they 
' ve been getting it. We have not known what we ' ve wanted and we ' ve been 
out-traded in almost every instance. The other **point** I wanna make is about 
our defense. We ' ve got to be a **nation** blessed with a defense capability 
that ' s efficient, tough, capable, well organized, narrowly focused – 
fighting capability. The ability to fight, if necessary, is the **best** way to 
avoid the chance for, or the requirement to fight. And the last **point** I 
wanna make is this: Mr. Ford, Mr. Kissinger have uh – continued on with the 
**policies** and **failures** of Richard Nixon. Even the **Republican** 
platform has criticized the lack of leadership in Mr. Ford and they ' ve 
criticized the **foreign** **policy** of this administration. This is one 
instance where I **agree** with – with the **Republican** platform. I might 
say this in closing, and that is that as far as **foreign** **policy** goes, 
Mr. Kissinger has been the **president** of this country. Mr. Ford has shown an 
absence of leadership, and an absence of a grasp of what this country is and 
what it ought to be. That ' s got to be changed. And that ' s one of the major 
issues in this uh – campaign of 1976 .

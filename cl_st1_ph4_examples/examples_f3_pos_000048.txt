I believe in being strong and resolute and determined. And I will hunt down and 
kill the **terrorists** , wherever they are. But we also have to be smart, Jim. 
And smart means not diverting your attention from the real **war** on terror in 
Afghanistan against Osama **bin** Laden and taking if off to Iraq where the 9 / 
11 Commission confirms there was no connection to 9 / 11 itself and Saddam 
Hussein, and where the reason for going to **war** was **weapons** of **mass** 
**destruction** , not the removal of Saddam Hussein. This president has made, I 
regret to say, a colossal error of judgment. And judgment is what we look for 
in the president of the United States of America. I ' m proud that important 
**military** figures who are supporting me in this race: former Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili; just yesterday, General Eisenhower ' 
s son, General John Eisenhower, endorsed me; General Admiral William Crown; 
General Tony McBeak, who ran the Air **Force** **war** so effectively for his 
**father** â€” all believe I would make a stronger **commander** in **chief** . 
And they believe it because they know I would not take my eye off of the goal: 
Osama **bin** Laden. Unfortunately, he escaped in the mountains of Tora Bora. 
We had him surrounded. But we didn ' t use American **forces** , the best 
**trained** in the world, to go kill him. The president relied on Afghan 
warlords and he outsourced that job too. That ' s wrong.

Well, the primary responsibility for **education** is — is, of course, at the 
state and **local** level. But the federal government also can play a very 
important role. And I — and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, he ' s — 
some ideas he ' s put forward on Race to the Top, not all of them, but some of 
them I agree with and — and congratulate him for pursuing that. The federal 
government can get **local** and — and state **schools** to do a better job. 
My own view, by the way, is I ' ve added to that. I happen to believe, I want 
the **kids** that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I — these 
are disabled **kids** or — or — or poor **kids** or — or lower-income 
**kids** , rather, I want them to be able to go to the **school** of their 
choice. So all federal funds, instead of going to the — to the state or to 
the **school** **district** , I ' d have go, if you will, follow the child and 
let the **parent** and the child decide where to send their — their — their 
**student** .

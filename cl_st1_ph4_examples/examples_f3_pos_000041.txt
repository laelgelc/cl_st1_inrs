The purpose of this debate and the outcome of the election will determine three 
basic things: Leadership, upholding the principles of our country, and proper 
priorities and commitments for the future. This election will also determine 
what kind of world we leave our children. Will it be a nightmare world 
threatened with the **proliferation** of atomic bombs, not just in five major 
countries but dozens of smaller countries that have been permitted to develop 
atomic **weapons** because of a failure of our top leadership to stop 
**proliferation** ? Will we have a world of hunger and – and hatred, and will 
we be living in an armed camp stripped of our friendship and **allies** hiding 
behind a tight defense that ' s been drawn in around us because we are fearful 
of the outside world? Will we have a government of secrecy that excludes the 
American people from participation in making basic decisions and therefore 
covers up mistakes and makes it possible for our government – our government 
– to depart from the principles of our Constitution and Bill of Rights? Or 
will we have a world of **peace** with the **threat** of atomic **weapons** 
eliminated, with full **trade** , with our people at work, inflation 
controlled, openness in government, our people proud once again, Congress, 
citizens, president, secretary of state working in harmony and unity toward a 
common future? Or world where people have enough to eat and a world where we 
care about those who don ' t? Can we become a breadbasket of the world instead 
of the arms merchant of the world? I believe we can and we ought to. Now we ' 
ve been hurt in recent years in this country. In the aftermath of Vietnam, 
Cambodia, Chile, Pakistan, Angola, Watergate, CIA, we ' ve been hurt. Our 
people feel that we ' ve lost something precious. That ' s not necessary. I 
wanna see our nation – return to a posture and an image and a standard to 
make us proud once again. I remember the world with NATO, and the world of 
Point Four, and the world of the Marshall Plan, and the world of the **Peace** 
Corps. Why can ' t we have that once again? We ought to be a beacon for nations 
who search for **peace** and who search for freedom, who search for individual 
liberty, who search for basic human rights. We haven ' t been lately. We can be 
once again. We ' ll never have that world leadership until we are strong at 
home, and we can have that strength if we return to the basic principles. It 
ought not to be a strength of bombast and **threats** . It ought to be a quiet 
strength based on the integrity of our people, the vision of the Constitution, 
an in- innate strong will and purpose that God ' s given us in the greatest 
nation on earth – the United States.

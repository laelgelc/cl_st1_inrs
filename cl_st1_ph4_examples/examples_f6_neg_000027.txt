Hillary and I also agree that the establishment of humanitarian **zones** in 
northern Syria with the **provision** of international human **aid** , 
consistent with the U. N. Security Council **resolution** that was passed in 
February 2014 , would be a very, very good idea. And Hillary also has the 
ability to stand up to Russia in a way that this ticket does not. Donald Trump, 
again and again, has praised Vladimir Putin. And it ' s clear that he has 
business dealings with **Russian** oligarchs who are very connected to Putin. 
The Trump campaign management team had to be fired a month or so ago because of 
those shadowy connections with pro-Putin forces. Governor Pence made the odd 
claim, he said inarguably Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President 
Obama. Vladimir Putin has run his economy into the ground. He persecutes LGBT 
folks and journalists. If you don ' t know the difference between dictatorship 
and leadership, then you got to go back to a fifth-grade civics class. I ' ll 
tell you what offends me â€¦

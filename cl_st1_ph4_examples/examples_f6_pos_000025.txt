Mr. President, Mr. President, you ' re entitled as the president to your own 
airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts. All right, I ' m not 
going to cut **education** funding. I don ' t have any plan to cut 
**education** funding and — and grants that go to people going to **college** 
. I ' m planning on ( inaudible ) to grow. So I ' m not planning on making 
changes there. But you make a very good point, which is that the place you put 
your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is. You put 
$90 billion into — into green jobs. And I — look, I ' m all in favor of 
green energy. $90 billion, that would have — that would have hired 2 million 
**teachers** . $90 billion. And these businesses, many of them have gone out of 
business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have 
gone out of business. A number of them happened to be owned by people who were 
contributors to your campaigns. Look, the right course for America ' s 
government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the 
economic player, picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health 
treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed 
in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records 
in the world. The right answer for government is say, How do we make the 
private sector become more efficient and more effective? How do we get 
**schools** to be more competitive? Let ' s grade them. I propose we grade our 
**schools** so **parents** know which **schools** are succeeding and failing, 
so they can take their child to a — to a **school** that he ' s being more 
successful. I don ' t want to cut our commitment to **education** . I wanted to 
make it more effective and efficient. And by the way, I ' ve had that 
experience. I don ' t just talk about it. I ' ve been there. Massachusetts 
**schools** are ranked number one in the nation. This is not because I didn ' t 
have commitment to **education** . It ' s because I care about **education** 
for all of our **kids** .

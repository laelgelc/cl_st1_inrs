The vice president just said that we should focus on state **sponsors** of 
terrorism. Iran has moved forward with its nuclear weapons program. They ' re 
more dangerous today than they were four years ago. North Korea has moved 
forward with their nuclear weapons program, gone from one to two nuclear 
weapons to six to eight nuclear weapons. This vice president has been an 
advocate for over a decade for lifting **sanctions** against Iran, the largest 
state **sponsor** of terrorism on the planet. It ' s a mistake. We should not 
only not lift them, we should strengthen those **sanctions** .

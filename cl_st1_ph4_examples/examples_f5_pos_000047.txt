It ' s absolutely true. Look, there ' s no question but the people recognize 
that we have not produced more ( inaudible ) on federal lands and in federal 
**waters** . And **coal** , **coal** **production** is not up; **coal** jobs 
are not up. I was just at a **coal** facility, where some 1 , 200 people lost 
their jobs. The right course for America is to have a true all-of-the-above 
policy. I don ' t think anyone really believes that you ' re a person who ' s 
going to be pushing for **oil** and **gas** and **coal** . You ' ll get your 
chance in a moment. I ' m still speaking.

Well I — I absolutely believe that America has a — a **responsibility** , 
and the privilege of helping **defend** **freedom** and promote the principles 
that — that make the **world** more peaceful. And those principles include 
**human** rights, **human** dignity, **free** enterprise, **freedom** of 
expression, elections. Because when there are elections, **people** tend to 
vote for **peace** . They don ' t vote for **war** . So we want to promote 
those principles around the **world** . We recognize that there are **places** 
of conflict in the **world** . We want to end those conflicts to the extent 
humanly possible. But in **order** to be able to fulfill our role in the 
**world** , America must be **strong** . America must **lead** . And for that 
to happen, we have to strengthen our economy here at home. You can ' t have 23 
million **people** **struggling** to get a job. You can ' t have an economy 
that over the last three years keeps slowing down its growth rate. You can ' t 
have kids coming out of college, half of them can ' t find a job **today** , or 
a job that ' s commensurate with their college degree. We have to get our 
economy going. And our **military** , we ' ve got to strengthen our 
**military** long-term. We don ' t know what the **world** is going to throw at 
us down the road. We — we make decisions **today** in the **military** that 
— that will confront challenges we can ' t imagine. In the 2000 debates, 
there was no mention of terrorism, for instance. And a year later, 9 / 11 
happened. So, we have to make decisions based upon uncertainty, and that means 
a **strong** **military** . I will not cut our **military** budget. We have to 
also stand by our **allies** . I — I think the tension that existed between 
Israel and the United **States** was very unfortunate. I think also that 
pulling our **missile** defense **program** out of Poland in the way we did was 
also unfortunate in terms of, if you will, disrupting the relationship in some 
ways that existed between us. And then, of course, with **regards** to standing 
for our principles, when — when the **students** took to the streets in 
Tehran and the **people** there protested, the Green Revolution occurred, for 
the **president** to be silent I thought was an enormous mistake. We have to 
stand for our principles, stand for our **allies** , stand for a **strong** 
**military** and stand for a **stronger** economy.

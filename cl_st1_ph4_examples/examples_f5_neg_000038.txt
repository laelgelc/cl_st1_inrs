And yet she didn ' t know the word—the letter C on a document. Right? She 
didn ' t even know what that word—what that letter meant. You know, it ' s 
amazing. I ' m watching Hillary go over facts. And she ' s going after fact 
after fact, and she ' s lying again, because she said she—you know, what she 
did with the e-mails was fine. You think it was fine to delete 33 , 000 
e-mails? I don ' t think so. She said the 33 , 000 e-mails had to do with her 
daughter ' s wedding, number one, and a yoga class. Well, maybe we ' ll give 
three or three or four or five or something. 33 , 000 e-mails deleted, and now 
she ' s saying there wasn ' t anything **wrong** . And more importantly, that 
was after getting a subpoena. That wasn ' t before. That was after. She got it 
from the United States Congress. And I ' ll be honest, I am so disappointed in 
congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen. Our Justice 
Department, where her husband goes onto the back of an airplane for 39 
**minutes** , talks to the attorney **general** days before a ruling is going 
to be made on her case. But for you to say that there was nothing **wrong** 
with you deleting 39 , 000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself. 
What you did—and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States 
Congress.

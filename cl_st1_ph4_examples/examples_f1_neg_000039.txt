The platform to which the President refers, in fact, calls for a **religious** 
test in the selection of judges. And Jerry Falwell says that means we get two 
or three judges. And it would involve a **religious** test for the first time 
in American life. Let ' s take the example that the President cites. I believe 
in **prayer** . My family prays. We ' ve never had any difficulty finding time 
to pray. But do we want a **constitutional** amendment adopted of the kind 
proposed by the President that gets the local politicians into the business of 
selecting **prayers** that our children must either recite in school or be 
embarrassed and asked to excuse themselves? Who would write the **prayer** ? 
What would it say? How would it be resolved when those disputes occur? It seems 
to me that a moment ' s reflection tells you why the United States Senate 
turned that amendment down, because it will undermine the practice of honest 
faith in our country by politicizing it. We don ' t want that.

I think the lessons of Iraq are very clear that you cannot have a failed 
**strategy** that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict. Our initial 
**military** success, we went in to Baghdad and everybody celebrated. And then 
the **war** was very badly mishandled. I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and 
said, we ' ve got to change this **strategy** . This **strategy** requires 
additional **troops** , it requires a fundamental change in **strategy** and I 
fought for it. And finally, we came up with a great general and a **strategy** 
that has succeeded. This **strategy** has succeeded. And we are winning in 
Iraq. And we will come home with victory and with **honor** . And that 
withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds. And I want 
to tell you that now that we will succeed and our **troops** will come home, 
and not in defeat, that we will see a stable **ally** in the region and a 
fledgling **democracy** . The **consequences** of defeat would have been 
increased **Iranian** influence. It would have been increase in sectarian 
violence. It would have been a wider **war** , which the United States of 
America might have had to come back. So there was a lot at stake there. And 
thanks to this great general, David Petraeus, and the **troops** who serve 
under him, they have succeeded. And we are winning in Iraq, and we will come 
home. And we will come home as we have when we have won other **wars** and not 
in defeat.

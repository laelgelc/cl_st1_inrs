When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion-dollar 
**deficit** greeting me. And we know where it came from: two wars that were 
**paid** for on a credit card; two **tax** **cuts** that were not **paid** for; 
and a whole bunch of **programs** that were not **paid** for; and then a 
massive economic crisis. And despite that, what we ' ve said is, yes, we had to 
take some initial **emergency** measures to make sure we didn ' t slip into a 
Great Depression, but what we ' ve also said is, let ' s make sure that we are 
**cutting** out those things that are not helping us **grow** . So 77 
**government** **programs** , everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had 
ordered but weren ' t **working** very well, 18 **government** — 18 
**government** **programs** for **education** that were well-intentioned, not 
weren ' t helping kids learn, we went after **medical** fraud in Medicare and 
Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have 
**saved** tens of **billions** of **dollars** , $50 **billion** of waste taken 
out of the system. And I **worked** with Democrats and Republicans to **cut** a 
trillion **dollars** out of our discretionary domestic **budget** . That ' s 
the largest **cut** in the discretionary domestic **budget** since Dwight 
Eisenhower. Now, we all know that we ' ve got to do more. And so I ' ve **put** 
forward a specific $4 trillion **deficit** **reduction** **plan** . It ' s on a 
website. You can look at all the numbers, what **cuts** we make and what 
revenue we **raise** . And the way we do it is $2 . 50 for every **cut** , we 
ask for $1 of **additional** revenue, **paid** for, as I indicated earlier, by 
asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a 
little bit more to reduce the **deficit** . Governor Romney earlier mentioned 
the Bowles-Simpson commission. Well, that ' s how the commission — bipartisan 
commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do 
it, in a **balanced** way with some revenue and some **spending** **cuts** . 
And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have. Let — let me 
just finish their point, because you ' re looking for contrast. You know, when 
Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the 
nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending **cuts** for just 
$1 of revenue? And he said no. Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, 
then that means you are going to be gutting our **investments** in schools and 
**education** . It means that Governor Romney … … talked about Medicaid and 
how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30 
**percent** **cut** in the primary **program** we help for **seniors** who are 
in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities.

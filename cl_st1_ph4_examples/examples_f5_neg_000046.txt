General Petraeus has just taken over a position of responsibility, where he has 
the command and will really set the tone for the strategy and tactics that are 
used. And I ' ve had conversations with him. It is the same overall strategy. 
Of course, we have to do some things tactically, some of which Senator Obama is 
correct on. We have to double the size of the Afghan army. We have to have a 
streamlined NATO command structure. We have to do a lot of things. We have to 
work much more closely with the Pakistanis. But most importantly, we have to 
have the same strategy, which Senator Obama said wouldn ' t work, couldn ' t 
work, still fails to admit that he was **wrong** about Iraq. He still will not 
admit that he was **wrong** about the strategy of the surge in Iraq, and that ' 
s the same kind of strategy of go out and secure and hold and allow people to 
live normal lives. And once they feel secure, then they lead normal, social, 
economic, political lives, the same thing that ' s happening in Iraq today. So 
I have confidence that General Petraeus, working with the Pakistanis, working 
with the Afghans, doing the same job that he did in Iraq, will again. We will 
succeed and we will bring our **troops** home with **honor** and victory and 
not in defeat.

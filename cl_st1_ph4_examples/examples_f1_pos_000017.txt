I disagree with both of them. For one thing, let me just follow up here. I 
disagree with Mr. Perot that the answer is to **raise** — **put** a 50-cent 
gas **tax** on the **middle** **class** and **raise** more **taxes** on the 
**middle** **class** and the **working** poor than on the **wealthy** . His own 
analysis says that unemployment will be slightly **higher** in 1995 under his 
**plan** than it is today. And as far as what Mr. Bush says, he is the person 
who **raised** **taxes** on the **middle** **class** after saying he wouldn ' 
t. And just this year, Mr. Bush **vetoed** a **tax** **increase** on the 
**wealthy** that gave **middle** **class** **tax** **relief** . He **vetoed** 
**middle** **class** **tax** **relief** this year. And furthermore, under this 
administration, **spending** has **increased** more than it has in the last 20 
years and he asked Congress to spend more **money** than it actually spent. 
Now, it ' s hard to out-spend Congress but he tried to for the last 3 years. So 
my view is the **middle** **class** is the — they ' ve been suffering, Jim. 
Now, should **people** **pay** more for Medicare if they can? Yes. Should they 
**pay** more for Social Security if they get more out of it than they **paid** 
in, they ' re upper **income** **people** ? Yes. But look what ' s happened to 
the **middle** **class** . **Middle** **class** Americans are **working** 
harder for less **money** than they were making ten years ago and they ' re 
**paying** **higher** **taxes** . The **tax** burden on them has not gone down. 
It has gone up. I don ' t think the answer is to slow the **economy** down 
more, drive unemployment up more and undermine the **health** of the 
**private** **sector** . The answer is to invest and **grow** this **economy** 
. That ' s what **works** in other countries and that ' s what ' ll **work** 
here.

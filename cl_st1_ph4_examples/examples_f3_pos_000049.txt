I, too, thank the University of Miami, and say our prayers are with the good 
people of this state, who ' ve suffered a lot. September the 11th changed how 
America must look at the world. And since that day, our nation has been on a 
multi-pronged **strategy** to keep our country safer. We pursued Al Qaida 
wherever Al Qaida tries to hide. Seventy-five percent of known Al Qaida 
**leaders** have been brought to justice. The rest of them know we ' re after 
them. We ' ve upheld the doctrine that said if you harbor a **terrorist** , you 
' re equally as guilty as the **terrorist** . And the Taliban are no longer in 
power. Ten million people have registered to vote in Afghanistan in the 
upcoming presidential election. In Iraq, we saw a **threat** , and we realized 
that after September the 11th, we must take **threats** seriously, before they 
fully materialize. Saddam Hussein now sits in a prison cell. America and the 
world are safer for it. We continue to pursue our policy of disrupting those 
who proliferate **weapons** of **mass** **destruction** . Libya has disarmed. 
The A. Q. Khan network has been brought to justice. And, as well, we ' re 
pursuing a **strategy** of freedom around the world, because I understand free 
nations will reject terror. Free nations will answer the hopes and aspirations 
of their people. Free nations will help us achieve the **peace** we all want.

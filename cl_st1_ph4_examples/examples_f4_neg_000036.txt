The United States must and will maintain complete access to the Panama Canal. 
The United States must maintain a defense capability of the Panama Canal. And 
the United States will maintain our national security interest in the Panama 
Canal. The negotiations far the Panama Canal started under President Johnson 
and have continued up to the present time. I believe those negotiations should 
continue. But there are certain guidelines that must be followed, and I ' ve 
just defined them. Let me take just a minute to comment on something that 
Governor Carter said. On non – nu- oh – uh – nonproliferation, in May of 
l975 , I called for a **conference** of uh – nuclear suppliers. That 
**conference** has met six times. In May of this year, Governor Carter took the 
first initiative, approximately twelve months after I had taken my initiative a 
year ago.

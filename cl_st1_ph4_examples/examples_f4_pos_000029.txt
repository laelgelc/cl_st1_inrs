Like Mr. Perot, I have held crack babies in my **arms** . But I know more about 
this, I think, than anybody else up here because I have a brother who ' s a 
recovering **drug** addict. I ' m very **proud** of him. But I can tell you 
this. If **drugs** were legal, I don ' t think he ' d be alive today. I am 
adamantly opposed to legalizing **drugs** . He is alive today because of the 
**criminal** **justice** system. That ' s a mistake. What should we do? First, 
we ought to prevent more of this on the **street** . Thirty years ago, there 
were three policemen for every **crime** . Now there are three **crimes** for 
every policeman. We need a hundred thousand more **police** on the **street** . 
I have a plan for that. Secondly, we ought to have treatment on demand. 
Thirdly, we ought to have boot camps for first-time nonviolent offenders so 
they can get discipline and treatment and education and get reconnected to the 
community before they ' re severed and sent to prison, where they can learn how 
to be first class **criminals** . There is a **crime** bill that, lamentably, 
was blocked from passage once again, mostly by Republicans in the US Senate, 
which would have addressed some of these problems. That **crime** bill is going 
to be one of my highest priorities next January if I become president.

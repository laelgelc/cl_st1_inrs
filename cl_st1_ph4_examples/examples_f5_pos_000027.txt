A brown field is an abandoned industrial site that just sits idle in some of 
our urban centers. And people are willing to invest capital in the brown fields 
don ' t want to do so for fear of lawsuit. I think we ought to have federal 
liability protection, depending upon whether or not standards have been met. 
The book you mentioned that Vice President Gore wrote, he also called for 
taxing — big **energy** taxes in order to **clean** up the environment. And 
now that the **energy** prices are high, I guess he ' s not advocating those 
big **energy** taxes right now. I believe we ought to fully fund the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund to — with half the money going to states so states 
can make the right decisions for **environmental** quality. I think we need to 
have **clean** **coal** technologies. I propose $2 billion worth. By the way, I 
just found out the other day an interesting fact, that there is a national 
petroleum reserve right next to — in Prudhoe Bay that your administration 
opened up for exploration in that pristine area. And it was a smart move 
because there ' s **gas** reserves up there. We need **gas** pipelines to bring 
the **gas** down. **Gas** is a **clean** fuel that we can burn to — we need 
to make sure that if we decontrol our plants that there ' s mandatory — that 
the plants must conform to **clean** air standards, the grandfathered plants, 
that ' s what we did in Texas. No excuses. You must conform. In other words, 
there are practical things we can do. But it starts with working in a 
collaborative effort with states and local folks. If you own the land, every 
day is Earth Day. People care a lot about their land and care about their 
environment. Not all wisdom is in Washington, D. C. on this issue.

Vice President Cheney has been the most **dangerous** vice president we ' ve 
had probably in American history. The idea he doesn ' t realize that Article I 
of the Constitution defines the role of the vice president of the United 
States, that ' s the Executive Branch. He works in the Executive Branch. He 
should understand that. Everyone should understand that. And the primary role 
of the vice president of the United States of America is to support the 
president of the United States of America, give that president his or her best 
judgment when sought, and as vice president, to preside over the Senate, only 
in a time when in fact there ' s a tie vote. The Constitution is explicit. The 
only authority the vice president has from the legislative standpoint is the 
vote, only when there is a tie vote. He has no authority relative to the 
Congress. The idea he ' s part of the Legislative Branch is a bizarre notion 
invented by Cheney to aggrandize the power of a unitary executive and look 
where it has gotten us. It has been very **dangerous** .

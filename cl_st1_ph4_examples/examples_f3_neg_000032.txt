I mentioned the radical departure of Governor Reagan from the principles or 
ideals of historical perspective of his own party. I don ' t think that can be 
better illustrated than in the case of guaranteeing women equal rights under 
the Constitution of our nation. For 40 years, the Republican Party platforms 
called for guaranteeing women equal rights with a **constitutional** 
**amendment** . Six predecessors of mine who served in the Oval Office called 
for this guarantee of women ' s rights. Governor Reagan and his new Republican 
Party have departed from this commitment â€“ a very severe blow to the 
opportunity for women to finally correct discrimination under which they have 
suffered. When a man and a women do the same amount of work, a man gets paid $1 
. 00 , a women only gets paid 59 **cents** . And the equal rights **amendment** 
only says that equality of rights shall not be abridged for omen b the Federal 
Government or by he state governments. That is all it says a simple guarantee 
of equality of opportunity which typifies the Democratic arty, and which is a 
very important commitment of mine, as contrasted with Governor Reagan ' s 
radical departure from the long-standing policy of his own party.

This late conversion is interesting to me. ( Laughter and applause ) I must 
say, when they talk about Boston Harbor and he says he hasn ' t done anything, 
the facts are he has a $6-billion program under way on waste treatment. And it 
was this administration, their administration, that cut out the money early on 
to be able to **clean** up **water** , and made it impossible to move ahead at 
that time on Boston Harbor. We are the authors, the Democratic Party, of 
**Clean** Air, of **Clean** **Water** , of the superfund. I am one who played a 
very major role in passing the superfund legislation. And every 
**environmental** organization that I know, every major one, has now endorsed 
the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket. And I am one who has just received the 
**environmental** award in Texas for the work I ' ve done to **clean** up the 
bays, to **clean** up the **water** , off the coast of Texas. No, I think we 
know well who ' s going to help **clean** up this environment. The record is 
there, the history is there. And Dukakis and Bentsen will be committed to that. 
( Applause )

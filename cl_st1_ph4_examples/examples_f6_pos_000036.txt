Let me just finish the point. The — where they ' re partnering so that they ' 
re designing training programs. And people who are going through them know that 
there ' s a job waiting for them if they complete it. That makes a big 
difference, but that requires some federal support. Let me just say one final 
example. When it comes to making **college** affordable, whether it ' s 
two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as president was we were 
sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the **student** loan 
program, even though the loans were guaranteed. So there was no risk for the 
banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system. And we 
said, " Why not cut out the middleman? " And as a **consequence** , what we ' 
ve been able to do is to provide millions more **students** assistance, lower 
or keep low interest rates on **student** loans. And this is an example of 
where our priorities make a difference. Governor Romney, I genuinely believe 
cares about **education** , but when he tells a **student** that, you know, " 
you should borrow money from your **parents** to go to **college** , " you 
know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of 
a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, **kids** 
probably who attend University of Denver, just don ' t have that option. And 
for us to be able to make sure that they ' ve got that opportunity and they can 
walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those **kids** . 
It ' s how we ' re going to grow this economy over the long term.

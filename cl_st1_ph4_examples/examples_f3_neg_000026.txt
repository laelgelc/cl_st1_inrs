When uh – the Vice President quotes me in January, sixty, I do not believe 
the **federal** government should pay directly teachers ' **salaries** , but 
that was not the issue before the Senate in February. The issue before the 
Senate was that the money would be given to the state. The state then could 
determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher 
**salaries** . On that question the Vice President and I disagreed. I voted in 
favor of that proposal and supported it strongly, because I think that that 
provided assistance to our teachers for their **salaries** without any chance 
of **federal** control and it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I 
disagreed, and his tie vote uh – defeated his breaking the tie defeated the 
proposal. I don ' t want the **federal** government paying teachers ' 
**salaries** directly. But if the money will go to the states and the states 
can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers 
' **salaries** , in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school 
board and the school committee. And therefore I think that was a sound proposal 
and that is why I supported it and I regret that it did not pass. Secondly, 
there have been statements made that uh – the Democratic platform would cost 
a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget. That is 
wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years 
the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the 
appropriations by over ten billion dollars. That is not my view and I think it 
ought to be stated very clearly on the record. My view is that you can do these 
programs – and they should be carefully drawn – within a balanced budget if 
our economy is moving ahead.

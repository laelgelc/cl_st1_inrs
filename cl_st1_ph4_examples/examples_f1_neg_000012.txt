My **response** is that, think about what the President knew in January and 
didn ' t tell the American people. He was told this was a serious virus that 
spread in the air, and it was much worse than — much worse — than the flu. 
He went on record and said to one of your colleagues, recorded, that in fact he 
knew how **dangerous** it was but he didn ' t want to tell us, didn ' t want to 
tell us because he didn ' t want us to panic. He didn ' t want us — Americans 
don ' t panic. He panicked. But, guess what, in the meantime, we find out in 
the New York Times the other day that in fact, his folks went to Wall Street 
and said, ' this is a really **dangerous** thing, ' and a memo out of that 
meeting — not from his administration, but from some of the brokers — said, 
' sell short, because we gotta get moving. It ' s a **dangerous** problem. '

Well, for 18 months he ' s been running on this **tax** **plan** . And now, 
five weeks before the election, he ' s saying that his **big** , bold idea is, 
" Never mind. " And the fact is that if you are lowering the **rates** the way 
you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough 
deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid 
either **raising** the **deficit** or burdening the **middle** **class** . It ' 
s — it ' s math. It ' s arithmetic. Now, Governor Romney and I do share a 
deep **interest** in encouraging small-business **growth** . So at the same 
time that my **tax** **plan** has already lowered **taxes** for 98 **percent** 
of **families** , I also lowered **taxes** for **small** **businesses** 18 
times. And what I want to do is continue the **tax** **rates** — the **tax** 
**cuts** that we **put** into place for **small** **businesses** and 
**families** . But I have said that for **incomes** over $250 , 000 a year, 
that we should go back to the **rates** that we had when Bill Clinton was 
president, when we **created** 23 million new **jobs** , went from **deficit** 
to surplus, and **created** a whole lot of millionaires to boot. And the reason 
this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the 
**deficit** , we cannot only encourage **job** **growth** through **small** 
**businesses** , but we ' re also able to make the **investments** that are 
necessary in **education** or in **energy** . And we do have a difference, 
though, when it comes to definitions of **small** **business** . Under — 
under my **plan** , 97 **percent** of **small** **businesses** would not see 
their **income** **taxes** go up. Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 
**percent** , they ' re the **job** creators, they ' d be burdened. But under 
Governor Romney ' s definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and 
billionaires who are **small** **businesses** . Donald Trump is a **small** 
**business** . Now, I know Donald Trump doesn ' t like to think of himself as 
**small** anything, but — but that ' s how you define **small** 
**businesses** if you ' re getting **business** **income** . And that kind of 
approach, I believe, will not **grow** our **economy** , because the only way 
to **pay** for it without either burdening the **middle** **class** or blowing 
up our **deficit** is to make drastic **cuts** in things like **education** , 
making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all 
the things that are helping America **grow** . And I think that would be a 
mistake.

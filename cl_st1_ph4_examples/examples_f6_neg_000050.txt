Well, with all due respect, Jim, there are nine empowerment **zones** , a few 
little tinkering with tax credits around the country for inner cities. Los 
Angeles, after the riots, did not even get an empowerment **zone** , believe it 
or not. That is just unconscionable in America to have left Watts, South 
Central and East L. A. out. Earl Graves of " Black Enterprise " magazine said 
the single greatest deterrent to black advancement is the lack of access to 
capital, the credit and ownership. That will change. We will green-line every 
city in the United States where there is unemployment and welfare and we will 
eliminate the Capital Gains Tax, eliminate the tax on a welfare mother that 
takes a job. That is the answer. Give ownership and entrepreneurship to low 
income people based on need, not the color of their skin.

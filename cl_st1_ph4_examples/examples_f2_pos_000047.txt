Well first of all, I don ' t **agree** with Senator Kennedy that Cuba is lost 
and certainly China was lost when this Administration came into **power** in 
1953 . As I look at Cuba **today** , I believe that we are **following** the 
right course, a course which is **difficult** but a course which under the 
circumstance is the only proper one which will see that the Cuban **people** 
get a chance to realize their aspirations of progress through **freedom** and 
that they get that with our cooperation with the other organi- of the states in 
the Organization of American **States** . Now Senator Kennedy has made some 
very **strong** criticisms of my part – or alleged part – in what has 
happened in Cuba. He **points** to the fact that I visited Cuba while Mr. 
Batista was in **power** there. I can only **point** out that if we are going 
to judge the Administrations in terms of our attitude toward dictators, we ' re 
glad to have a comparison with the previous administration. There were eleven 
dictators in South America and in Central America when we came in, in 1953 . 
**Today** there are only three left including the one in Cuba. We think that ' 
s pretty **good** progress. Senator Kennedy also indicated with **regard** to 
Cuba that he thought that I had made a mistake when I was in Cuba in not 
calling for **free** elections in that country. Now I ' m very surprised that 
Senator Kennedy, who is on the Foreign Relations Committee, would have made 
such a statement as this kind. As a matter of fact in his book, The 
**Strategy** for **Peace** , he took the right **position** . And that 
**position** is that the United **States** has a treaty – a treaty with all 
of the Organization of American **States** – which prohibits us from 
interfering in the internal affairs of any other state and prohibits them as 
well. For me to have made such a statement would been in direct uh – 
opposition to that treaty. Now with **regard** to Cuba, let me make one thing 
clear. There isn ' t any **question** but that we will **defend** our rights 
there. There isn ' t any **question** but that we will **defend** Guantanamo if 
it ' s attacked. There also isn ' t any **question** but that the **free** 
**people** of Cuba – the **people** who want to be **free** – are going to 
be **supported** and that they will attain their **freedom** . No, Cuba is not 
lost, and I don ' t think this kind of defeatist talk by Senator Kennedy helps 
the situation one bit.

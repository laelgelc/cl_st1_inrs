That ' s a loaded question. Well, first of all, I admire Senator Kerry ' s 
service to our country. I admire the fact that he is a great dad. I appreciate 
the fact that his daughters have been so kind to my daughters in what has been 
a pretty hard experience for, I guess, young girls, seeing their dads out there 
campaigning. I admire the fact that he served for 20 years in the Senate. 
Although I ' m not so sure I admire the record. I won ' t hold it against him 
that he went to Yale. There ' s nothing **wrong** with that. My concerns about 
the senator is that, in the course of this campaign, I ' ve been listening very 
carefully to what he says, and he changes positions on the war in Iraq. He 
changes positions on something as fundamental as what you believe in your core, 
in your heart of hearts, is right in Iraq. You cannot lead if you send mixed 
messages. Mixed messages send the **wrong** signals to our **troops** . Mixed 
messages send the **wrong** signals to our allies. Mixed messages send the 
**wrong** signals to the Iraqi citizens. And that ' s my biggest concern about 
my opponent. I admire his service. But I just know how this world works, and 
that in the councils of government, there must be certainty from the U. S. 
president. Of course, we change tactics when need to, but we never change our 
beliefs, the strategic beliefs that are necessary to protect this country in 
the world.

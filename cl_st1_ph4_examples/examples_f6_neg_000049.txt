There were several off-the-subject quaffers in that litany. Let me just 
mention, Senator Dole voted for $900 billion in tax increases. His running mate 
Jack Kemp once said that Bob Dole never met a tax he didn ' t hike. And 
everybody knows, including the Wall Street Journal, hardly a friend of the 
Democratic **party** of this administration, that the ' 82 tax increase he 
**sponsored** in inflation-adjusted dollars was the biggest tax increase in 
American history. So we ought to at least get the facts out here on the table 
so we can know where to go from here. 

Lemmas in this text that loaded on the factor:

party

You even brought some right-wing congressman into the White House to plot how 
to attack me for going to Russia in 1969-70 , when over 50 , 000 other 
Americans did. Now, I **honor** your service in World War II, I **honor** Mr. 
Perot ' s service in uniform and the service of every man and woman who ever 
served, including Admiral Crowe, who was your Chairman of the joint Chiefs and 
who ' s supporting me. But when Joe McCarthy went around this country attacking 
people ' s patriotism he was **wrong** . He was **wrong** . And a senator from 
Connecticut stood up to him named Prescott Bush. Your father was right to stand 
up to Joe McCarthy, you were **wrong** to attack my patriotism. I was opposed 
to the war but I loved my country and we need a president who will bring this 
country together, not divide it. We ' ve had enough division. I want to lead a 
unified country.

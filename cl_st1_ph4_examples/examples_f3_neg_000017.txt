Well, Candy, actually, in my state, the pro-gun folks and the anti-gun folks 
came together and put together a **piece** of **legislation** . And it ' s 
referred to as an assault weapon ban, but it had, at the signing of the bill, 
both the pro-gun and the anti-gun people came together, because it provided 
opportunities for both that both wanted. There were hunting opportunities, for 
instance, that haven ' t previously been available and so forth, so it was a 
mutually agreed- upon **piece** of **legislation** . That ' s what we need more 
of, Candy. What we have right now in Washington is a place that ' s gridlocked.

Yes. We have demanded that the American people sacrifice, and they have done 
very well. As a matter of fact, we ' re **importing** today about one-third 
less **oil** from overseas than we did just a year ago. We ' ve had a 25 % 
reduction since the first year I was in office. At the same time, as I have 
said earlier, we have added about nine million net new jobs in that period of 
time – a record never before achieved. Also, the new **energy** policy has 
been predicated on two factors: One is conservation, which requires sacrifice, 
and the other one, increase in **production** of American **energy** , which is 
going along very well – more **coal** this year than ever before in American 
history, more **oil** and **gas** wells **drilled** this year than ever before 
in history. The new economic revitalization program that we have in mind, which 
will be implemented next year, would result in tax credits which would let 
business invest in new tools and new factories to **create** even more new jobs 
– about one million in the next two years. And we also have planned a youth 
employment program which would encompass 600 , 000 jobs for young people. This 
has already passed the House, and it has an excellent prospect to pass the 
Senate.

Well, first of all, it ' s not **government** that makes business successful. 
It ' s not **government** investments that makes businesses grow and hire 
**people** . Let me also note that the greatest **threat** that the **world** 
**faces** , the greatest **national** **security** **threat** is a **nuclear** 
Iran. Let ' s talk about China. China has an **interest** that ' s very much 
like ours in one respect, and that is they want a stable **world** . They don ' 
t want **war** . They don ' t want to see protectionism. They don ' t want to 
see the **world** break out into — into various forms of chaos, because they 
have to — they have to manufacture **goods** and put **people** to **work** 
and they have about 20 , 000 — 20 million, rather, **people** coming out of 
the farms every year coming into the cities, needing jobs. So they want the 
economy to **work** and the **world** to be **free** and open. And so we can be 
a partner with China. We don ' t have to be an adversary in any way, shape or 
form. We can **work** with them, we can collaborate with them, if they ' re 
willing to be responsible. Now, they look at us and say, Is it a **good** idea 
to be with America? How **strong** are we going to be? How **strong** is our 
economy? They look at the fact that we owe ' em a trillion **dollars** and owe 
other **people** $16 trillion in total, including that. They look at our — 
our decision to — to cut back on our **military** capabilities. A trillion 
**dollars** . The secretary of defense called these trillion **dollars** of 
cuts to our **military** devastating. It ' s not my term, it ' s the 
**president** ' s own secretary of defense called these trillion **dollars** of 
cuts to our **military** devastating. It ' s not my term, it ' s the 
**president** ' s own Secretary of Defense, called them devastating. They look 
at America ' s commitments around the **world** and they see what ' s 
happening, and they say, well, OK. Is America going to be **strong** ? And the 
answer is, yes, if I ' m **president** , America will be very **strong** . We ' 
ll also make sure that we have trade relations with China that **work** for us. 
I ' ve watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and **people** 
have lost their jobs because China has not played by the same rules, in part by 
holding down artificially the value of their currency. It holds down the prices 
of their **goods** . It means our **goods** aren ' t as competitive and we lose 
jobs. That ' s got to end. They ' re making some progress; they need to make 
more. That ' s why on **day** one, i will label them a currency manipulator, 
which allows us to apply tariffs where they ' re taking jobs. They ' re 
stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, 
hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our **goods** . They have to 
understand we want to trade with them. We want a **world** that ' s stable. We 
like **free** enterprise, but you got to play by the rules.

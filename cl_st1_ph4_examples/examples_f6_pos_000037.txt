Yes, I ' d be glad to. In the first place, uh – as is the case with the 
environmental policy and the energy policy that I just described, and the 
policy for nonproliferation of uh – of nuclear waste, this administration has 
no urban policy. It ' s impossible for mayors or governors to cooperate with 
the resident, because they can ' t anticipate what ' s gonna happen next. A 
mayor of a city like New York, for instance, needs to know uh – eighteen 
months or two years ahead of time what responsibility the city will have in 
administration and in financing – in things like housing, uh – pollution 
control, uh – crime control, **education** , welfare and health. This has not 
been done, unfortunately. I remember the headline in the Daily News that said, 
" Ford to New York: Drop Dead. " I think it ' s very important that our cities 
know that they have a partner in the federal government. Quite often Congress 
has passed laws in the past designed to help people with uh – the ownership 
of homes and with the control of crime and with adequate health care and 
**education** programs and so forth. Uh – those uh programs were designed to 
help those who need it most. And quite often this has been in the very poor 
people and neighborhoods in the downtown urban centers. Because of the uh – 
great -ly- greatly uh – advantaged uh – tho- per – persons who live in 
the suburbs, better **education** , better organization, more articulate, more 
aware of what the laws are, quite often this money has been channeled out of 
the downtown centers where it ' s needed. Also I favor all revenue sharing 
money being used for **local** governments, and also to remove prohibitions in 
the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve 
**education** , and health care. We have now uh – for instance only 7 percent 
of the total **education** cost being financed by the federal government. When 
uh – the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent. That ' s a 
30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contributes to 
**education** in just eight years. And as you know, the **education** cost has 
gone up uh – tremendously. The last point is that the major – uh thrust has 
gotta be to put people back to work. We ' ve got an extraordinarily high 
unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh – particularly among 
the very poor and particularly among **minority** groups, sometimes 50 or 60 
percent. And the concentration of employment opportunities in those areas would 
help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base, but also to help reduce the 
extraordinary welfare cost. One of the major responsibilities on the shoulders 
of uh – New York City is to – is to finance welfare. And I favor a shifting 
of the welfare cost away from the **local** governments altogether. And over a 
longer period of time, let the federal government begin to absorb part of it 
that ' s now paid by the state governments. Those things would help a great 
deal with the cities, but we still have a – a very serious problem there.

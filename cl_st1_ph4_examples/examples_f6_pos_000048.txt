The differences are very clear. We have a positive plan based on three 
principles. We want to provide opportunity for all Americans. We insist on 
responsibility being accepted in turn by everyone, and we want to strengthen 
our **communities** and their ability to support families and individuals in 
our common effort to create a bright future. Here ' s how we plan to do that: 
We have a balanced budget plan that has targeted tax cuts for middle-income 
families. We ' ve already given tax cuts to 15 million of the hardest pressed 
working families in America. Our plan for the next four years features a $1 , 
500 tax credit, called a Hope Scholarship, for **tuition** at **community** 
**college** , junior **college** or **college** . A $10 , 000 tax deduction for 
**college** **tuition** for those who go further, so that, in essence, no 
American family will ever be taxed on the money they spend for **college** 
**tuition** . Also, tax relief for first-time home buyers, tax encouragement 
for savings and help in paying health care expenses, and a tax break, actually, 
the elimination of capital gains taxes on the â€” on the profits from the sale 
of a home. All of this is within a balanced budget plan, which protects 
Medicare, Medicaid, **education** and the environment.

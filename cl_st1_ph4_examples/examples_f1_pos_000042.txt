Let me start with how to control the **cost** of **health** **care** : 
**medical** liability **reform** , for starters, which he ' s opposed. 
Secondly, allow **small** **businesses** to pool together so they can share 
risk and buy **insurance** at the same discounts **big** **businesses** get to 
do. Thirdly, spread what ' s called **health** **savings** accounts. It ' s 
good for **small** **businesses** , good for owners. You own your own account. 
You can **save** tax-free. You get a catastrophic **plan** to help you on it. 
This is different from saying, " OK, let me incent you to go on the 
**government** . " He ' s talking about his **plan** to keep **jobs** here. You 
know he calls it an outsourcing to keep — stop outsourcing. Robert Rubin 
looked at his **plan** and said it won ' t **work** . The best way to keep 
**jobs** here in America is, one, have an **energy** **plan** . I **proposed** 
one to the Congress two years ago, encourages conservation, encourages 
technology to explore for environmentally friendly ways for coal — to use 
coal and gas. It encourages the use of renewables like ethanol and biodiesel. 
It ' s stuck in the Senate. He and his running-mate didn ' t show up to vote 
when they could have got it going in the Senate. Less regulations if we want 
**jobs** here; legal **reform** if we want **jobs** here; and we ' ve got to 
keep **taxes** **low** . Now, he says he ' s only going to **tax** the rich. Do 
you realize, 900 , 000 **small** **businesses** will be **taxed** under his 
**plan** because most **small** **businesses** are Subchapter S corps or 
limited partnerships, and they **pay** **tax** at the individual **income** 
**tax** level. And so when you ' re running up the **taxes** like that, you ' 
re **taxing** **job** creators, and that ' s not how you keep **jobs** here.

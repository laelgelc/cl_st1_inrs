Very briefly. Including the **parents** in the preschool **education** of their 
**kids** , even if they ' re poor and uneducated, can make a huge difference. 
We have a big program in my state that teaches mothers or fathers to teach 
their **kids** to get ready for **school** . It ' s the most successful thing 
we ' ve ever done. Just a fact clarification real quickly. We do not spend a 
higher percentage of our income on **public** **education** than every other 
country. There are 9 countries that spend more than we do on **public** 
**education** . We spend more on **education** ' cause we spend so much more on 
**colleges** . But if you look at **public** **education** alone and you take 
into account the fact that we have more racial diversity and more poverty, it 
makes a big difference. There are great **public** **schools** where there ' s 
**public** **school** choice, **accountability** and brilliant principals. I ' 
ll just mention one â€” the Beasley Academic Center in Chicago. I commend it to 
anybody. It ' s as good as any private **school** in the country.

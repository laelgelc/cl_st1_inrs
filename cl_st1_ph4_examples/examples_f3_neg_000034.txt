Yes. I am going to make a major speech on this whole subject next week before 
the next debate, and I will have an opportunity then to answer any other 
questions that may arise with regard to my position on it. There isn ' t any 
question but that we must move forward in every possible way to reduce the 
danger of war; to move toward controlled disarmament; to control tests; but 
also let ' s have in mind this: when Senator Kennedy suggests that we haven ' t 
been making an effort, he simply doesn ' t know what he ' s talking about. It 
isn ' t a question of the number of people who are working in an 
Administration. It ' s a question of who they are. This has been one of the 
highest level operations in the whole State Department right under the 
President himself. We have gone certainly the extra mile and then some in 
making offers to the Soviet Union on control of tests, on disarmament, and in 
every other way. And I just want to make one thing very clear. Yes, we should 
make a great effort. But under no circumstances must the United States ever 
make an agreement based on trust. There must be an absolute guarantee. Now, 
just a comment on Senator Kennedy ' s last answer. He forgets that in this same 
debate on the Formosa resolution, which he said he voted for – which he did 
– that he voted against an **amendment** , or was recorded against an 
**amendment** – and on this particular – or for an **amendment** , I should 
say – which passed the Senate overwhelmingly, seventy to twelve. And that 
**amendment** put the Senate of the United States on record with a majority of 
the Senator ' s own party voting for it, as well as the majority of Republicans 
– put them on record – against the very position that the Senator takes now 
of surrendering, of indicating in advance, that the United States will not 
defend the offshore islands.

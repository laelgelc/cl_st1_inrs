He disbanded the club, but he ' s still got the money. He is the number one – 
he is the number one receiver of political action **committee** money. Now, 
Senator Bentsen has talked about reform. Well, let me tell you about the reform 
that we ' re pushing. Let ' s eliminate political action **committees** , the 
special interest money. There ' s legislation before the Congress to do that. 
That way, we won ' t have to worry about breakfast clubs, or who ' s the number 
one PAC raiser. We can go back and get the contributions from the working men 
and women and the individuals of America. We can also strengthen our two 
**party** system – and it needs strengthening – and rely more on the 
political **parties** than we have in the past. That ' s the kind of campaign 
reform that I ' m for, and I hope the Senator will join me.

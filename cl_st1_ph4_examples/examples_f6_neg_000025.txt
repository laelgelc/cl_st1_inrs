It would be rather difficult to cover them in eight and- in two and a half 
minutes. I would suggest that these proposals could be mentioned. First, after 
each of my foreign trips I have made recommendations that have been adopted. 
For example, after my first trip abroad – abroad, I strongly **recommended** 
that we increase our exchange programs particularly as they related to exchange 
of persons of leaders in the labor field and in the information field. After my 
trip to South America, I made recommendations that a separate inter-American 
lending agency be set up which the South American nations would like much 
better than a lend- than to participate in the lending agencies which treated 
all the countries of the world the same. Uh – I have made other 
recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip 
abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian 
refugee situation which were adopted, not only by the President but some of 
them were enacted into law by the Congress. Within the Administration, as a 
chairman of the President ' s **Committee** on Price Stability and Economic 
Growth, I have had the opportunity to make recommendations which have been 
adopted within the Administration and which I think have been reasonably 
effective. I know Senator Kennedy suggested in his speech at Cleveland 
yesterday that that **committee** had not been particularly effective. I would 
only suggest that while we do not take the credit for it – I would not 
presume to – that since that **committee** has been formed the price line has 
been held very well within the United States.

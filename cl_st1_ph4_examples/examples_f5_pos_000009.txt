Yes, Senator McCain does support this. The chant is " **drill** , baby, 
**drill** . " And that ' s what we hear all across this country in our rallies 
because people are so hungry for those domestic **sources** of **energy** to be 
tapped into. They know that even in my own energy-producing state we have 
billions of barrels of **oil** and hundreds of trillions of cubic feet of 
**clean** , green **natural** **gas** . And we ' re building a nearly $40 
billion **natural** **gas** pipeline which is North America ' s largest and 
most you expensive infrastructure project ever to flow those **sources** of 
**energy** into hungry **markets** . Barack Obama and Senator Biden, you ' ve 
said no to everything in trying to find a domestic solution to the **energy** 
crisis that we ' re in. You even called **drilling** — safe, 
environmentally-friendly drilling offshore as raping the outer continental 
shelf. There — with new technology, with tiny footprints even on land, it is 
safe to **drill** and we need to do more of that. But also in that " all of the 
above " approach that Senator McCain supports, the alternative fuels will be 
tapped into: the nuclear, the **clean** **coal** . I was surprised to hear you 
mention that because you had said that there isn ' t anything — such a thing 
as **clean** **coal** . And I think you said it in a rope line, too, at one of 
your rallies.

The way we ' re going to reduce this budget deficit, and it is a challenge to 
make sure that it is reduce, is first to stick to the Gramm-Rudman targets. The 
Gramm-Rudman targets have worked. We ' ve reduced the Federal budget deficit 
$70 billion. Senator Bentsen voted against Gramm-Rudman, the very tool that has 
been used to bring the Federal budget deficit down. We ' re going to need all 
the tools possible to bring this Federal budget deficit down. We need the tools 
of a line **item** **veto** . A line **item** **veto** that 43 governors in 
this country have, but not the President of the United States. The President of 
the United States needs to have a line **item** **veto** . When Congress goes 
ahead and puts into appropriations bills unrequested and unnecessary spending, 
let the President put a line through that, send it back to the Congress and let 
the Congress vote on it again. Congress has to help out in reducing this budget 
deficit as much as the Executive Branch.

First of all, I ' ve already done something that nobody thought was possible. 
Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate. That is the worst 
part of Obamacare, as we call it. The individual mandate – where you have to 
pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance. 
I terminated it; it ' s gone. Now it ' s in court, because Obamacare is no 
good. But then I made a decision, ' Run it as well as you can ' — to my 
people, great people — ' Run it as well as you can. ' I could have gone the 
other route and made everybody very unhappy. They ran it. Premiums are down, 
everything ' s down. Here ' s the problem. No matter how well you run it, it ' 
s no good. What we ' d like to do is terminate it. We have the individual 
mandate done. I don ' t know that it ' s going to work. If we don ' t win, we 
will have to run it and we ' ll have Obamacare, but it will be better run. But 
it no longer is Obamacare. Because without the individual mandate, it ' s much 
different. Pre-existing **conditions** will always stay. What I would like to 
do is a much better health care, much better. We ' ll always protect people 
with pre-existing — so I ' d like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a 
brand new beautiful health care. The Democrats will do it because there ' ll be 
tremendous pressure on them. And we might even have the House by that time. And 
I think we ' re going to win the House, okay? You ' ll see, but I think we ' re 
gonna win the House. But come up with a better health care, always protecting 
people with pre-existing **conditions** — and one thing very important. We 
have 180 million people out there that have great private health care, far more 
than we ' re talking about with Obamacare. Joe Biden is going to terminate all 
of those policies. These are people that love their health care, people that 
have been successful — middle income people — been successful. They have 
180 million plans, 180 million people, families under what he wants to do, 
which will basically be socialized medicine. He won ' t even have a choice. 
They want to terminate 180 million plans. We have done an incredible job on 
health care. And we ' re going to do even better.

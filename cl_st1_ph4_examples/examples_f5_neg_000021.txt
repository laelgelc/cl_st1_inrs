Our policies are very different. I think that Senator Kennedy ' s policies and 
**recommendations** for the handling of the Castro regime are probably the most 
dangers- dangerously irresponsible **recommendations** that he ' s made during 
the course of this campaign. In effect, what Senator Kennedy recommends is that 
the United States government should give help to the exiles and to those within 
Cuba who oppose the Castro regime – provided they are anti-Batista. Now let ' 
s just see what this means. We have five treaties with Latin America, including 
the one setting up the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948 , in 
which we have agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of any other 
American country – and they as well have agreed to do likewise. The charter 
of the United Nations – its Preamble, Article I and Article II – also 
provide that there shall be no intervention by one nation in the internal 
affairs of another. Now I don ' t know what Senator Kennedy suggests when he 
says that we should help those who oppose the Castro regime, both in Cuba and 
without. But I do know this: that if we were to follow that **recommendation** 
, that we would lose all of our friends in Latin America, we would probably be 
condemned in the United Nations, and we would not accomplish our objective. I 
know something else. It would be an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to come 
in, to come into Latin America and to engage us in what would be a civil war, 
and possibly even worse than that. This is the major **recommendation** that he 
' s made. Now, what can we do? Well, we can do what we did with Guatemala. 
There was a Communist dictator that we inherited from the previous 
Administration. We quarantined Mr. Arbenz. The result was that the Guatemalan 
people themselves eventually rose up and they threw him out. We are 
quarantining Mr. Castro today. We ' re quarantining him diplomatically by 
bringing back our Ambassador; economically by cutting off trade, and Senator 
Kennedy ' s suggestion that the trade that we cut off is not significant is 
just one hundred percent **wrong** . We are cutting off the significant items 
that the Cuban regime needs in order to survive. By cutting off trade, by 
cutting off our diplomatic relations as we have, we will quarantine this regime 
so that the people of Cuba themselves will take care of Mr. Castro. But for us 
to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he 
would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want.

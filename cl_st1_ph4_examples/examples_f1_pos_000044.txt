Very easily. John Edwards is the author of the Patients ' Bill of Rights. He 
wanted to give **people** rights. John Edwards and I support tort **reform** . 
We both believe that, as lawyers — I ' m a lawyer, too. And I believe that we 
will be able to get a **fix** that has alluded everybody else because we know 
how to do it. It ' s in my health-care **proposal** . Go to johnkerry. com. You 
can pull it off of the Internet. And you ' ll find a tort **reform** **plan** . 
Now, **ladies** and gentlemen, important to understand, the president and his 
friends try to make a **big** deal out of it. Is it a problem? Yes, it ' s a 
problem. Do we need to **fix** it, particularly for OGBYNs ( sic ) and for 
brain surgeons and others? Yes. But it ' s less than 1 **percent** of the total 
**cost** of **health** **care** . Your **premiums** are going up. You ' ve gone 
up, in Missouri, about $3 , 500 . You ' ve gone up 64 **percent** . You ' ve 
seen co-pays go up, deductibles go up. Everything ' s gone up. Five million 
**people** have lost their **health** **insurance** under this president. He ' 
s done nothing about it. I have a **plan** . I have a **plan** to lower the 
**cost** of **health** **care** for you. I have a **plan** to **cover** all 
children. I have a **plan** to let you buy into the same **health** **care** 
senators and congressmen give themselves. I have a **plan** that ' s going to 
allow **people** 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early. And I have a **plan** 
that will take the catastrophic cases out of the system, off your backs, 
**pay** for it out of a **federal** **fund** , which lowers the **premiums** 
for everybody in America, makes American **business** more competitive and 
makes **health** **care** more affordable. Now, all of that can happen, but I 
have to ask you to do one thing - Join me in rolling back the president ' s 
unaffordable **tax** **cut** for **people** earning more than $200 , 000 a 
year. That ' s all. Ninety-eight **percent** of America, I ' m giving you a 
**tax** **cut** and I ' m giving you **health** **care** .

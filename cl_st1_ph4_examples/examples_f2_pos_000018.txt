I don ' t believe we should **move** to a cold-war relationship. I think it ' s 
in the **best** **interest** of the United **States** , and the **world** as a 
whole that the United **States** **negotiate** rather than go back to the 
cold-war relationship with the **Soviet** Union. I don ' t uh – look at the 
picture as bleakly as you have indicated in your **question** , Mr. Trewhitt. I 
believe that the United **States** ha- had many successes in recent years, in 
recent **months** , as far as the **Communist** movement is concerned. We have 
been successful in Portugal, where a year ago it looked like there was a very 
great possibility that the uh – **Communists** would take over in Portugal. 
It didn ' t happen. We have a **democracy** in Portugal **today** . A few uh 
– **months** ago, or I should say, maybe two years ago, the **Soviet** Union 
looked like they had continued **strength** in the Middle East. **Today** , 
according to Prime Minister Rabin, the **Soviet** Union is weaker in the Middle 
East than they have been in many, many years. The facts are, there – the 
**Soviet** Union relationship with Egypt is uh – at a low level. The 
**Soviet** Union relationship with Syria is at a very low **point** . The 
United **States** **today** , according to Prime Minister Rabin of Israel, is 
a- at a peak in its uh – **influence** and **power** in the Middle East. But 
let ' s turn for a minute to the uhh – southern African operations that are 
now going on. The United **States** of America took the initiative in southern 
Africa. We wanted to end the bloodshed in southern Africa. We wanted to have 
the right of self-determination in southern Africa. We wanted to have majority 
rule with the full protection of the rights of the **minority** . We wanted to 
preserve **human** dignity in southern Africa. We have taken the initiative, 
and in southern Africa **today** the United **States** is trusted by the black 
front-line **nations** and black Africa. The United **States** is trusted by 
other elements in southern Africa. The United **States** **foreign** **policy** 
under this administration has been one of progress and success. And I believe 
that instead of talking about **Soviet** progress, we can talk about 
**American** successes. And may I make an observation – part of the 
**question** you asked, Mr. Trewhitt? I don ' t believe that it ' s in the 
**best** **interest** of the United **States** and the NATO **nations** to have 
a **Communist** **government** in NATO. Mr. Carter has indicated he would look 
with sympathy to a **Communist** **government** in NATO. I think that would 
destroy the integrity and the **strength** of NATO, and I am totally opposed to 
it.

No, it ' s going to totally help you. And one thing we have to do: Repeal and 
replace the **disaster** known as Obamacare. It ' s destroying our country. It 
' s destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses. We 
have to repeal and replace Obamacare. You take a look at the kind of numbers 
that that will cost us in the year ' 17 , it is a **disaster** . If we don ' t 
repeal and replace—now, it ' s probably going to die of its own weight. But 
Obamacare has to go. It ' s—the **premiums** are going up 60 percent, 70 
percent, 80 percent. Next year they ' re going to go up over 100 percent. And I 
' m really glad that the **premiums** have started—at least the people see 
what ' s happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make 
it even worse, and it can ' t get any worse. Bad health care at the most 
expensive price. We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.

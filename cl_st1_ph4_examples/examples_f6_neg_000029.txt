But for me, I would tell you that for me the sanctity of life proceeds out of 
the belief that — that ancient principle that — where God says before you 
were formed in the womb, I knew you, and so for my first time in public life, I 
sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life. The state of 
Indiana has also sought to make sure that we expand alternatives in health care 
counseling for women, non-abortion alternatives. I ' m also very pleased at the 
fact we ' re well on our way in Indiana to becoming the most pro-adoption state 
in America. I think if you ' re going to be pro-life, you should — you should 
be pro-adoption. But what I can ' t understand is with Hillary Clinton and now 
Senator Kaine at her side is to support a practice like partial-birth abortion. 
I mean, to hold to the view — and I know Senator Kaine, you hold pro-life 
views personally — but the very idea that a child that is almost born into 
the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me. 
And I cannot — I can ' t conscience about — about a **party** that supports 
that. Or that — I know you ' ve historically opposed taxpayer funding of 
abortion. But Hillary Clinton wants to — wants to repeal the longstanding 
**provision** in the law where we said we wouldn ' t use taxpayer dollars to 
fund abortion. So for me, my faith informs my life. I try and spend a little 
time on my knees every day. But it all for me begins with cherishing the 
dignity, the worth, the value of every human life.

I don ' t know how long it will take. We can and we will get it under 6 
**percent** . Let ' s look at — let ' s take a look at the facts. Let ' s 
look at where we were when we came to office. The **economy** was in free fall. 
We had — the great recession **hit** ; 9 million **people** lost their 
**job** ; $1 . 7 — $1 . 6 trillion in wealth lost in equity in your homes, in 
retirement accounts for the **middle** **class** . We knew we had to act for 
the **middle** **class** . We immediately went out and rescued General Motors. 
We went ahead and made sure that we **cut** **taxes** for the **middle** 
**class** . And in addition to that, when that — when that occurred, what did 
Romney do? Romney said, " No, let Detroit go bankrupt. " We moved in and helped 
**people** refinance their homes. Governor Romney said, " No, let foreclosures 
**hit** the bottom. " But it shouldn ' t be surprising for a **guy** who says 
47 **percent** of the American **people** are unwilling to take responsibility 
for their own lives. My friend recently in a speech in Washington said " 30 
**percent** of the American **people** are takers. " These **people** are my 
mom and dad — the **people** I **grew** up with, my neighbors. They **pay** 
more effective **tax** than Governor Romney **pays** in his **federal** 
**income** **tax** . They are elderly **people** who in fact are living off of 
Social Security. They are veterans and **people** fighting in Afghanistan right 
now who are, quote, " not **paying** any **tax** . " I ' ve had it up to here 
with this notion that 47 **percent** — it ' s about time they take some 
responsibility here. And instead of **signing** pledges to Grover Norquist not 
to ask the **wealthiest** among us to contribute to bring back the **middle** 
**class** , they should be **signing** a pledge saying to the **middle** 
**class** we ' re going to level the playing field; we ' re going to give you a 
**fair** shot again; we are going to not repeat the mistakes we made in the 
past by having a different set of rules for Wall Street and Main Street, making 
sure that we continue to hemorrhage these **tax** **cuts** for the super 
**wealthy** . They ' re pushing the continuation of a **tax** **cut** that will 
give an **additional** $500 **billion** in **tax** **cuts** to 120 , 000 
**families** . And they ' re holding hostage the **middle** **class** **tax** 
**cut** because they say we won ' t pass — we won ' t continue the **middle** 
**class** **tax** **cut** unless you give the **tax** **cut** for the super 
**wealthy** . It ' s about time they take some responsibility.

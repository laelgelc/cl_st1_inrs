Yes, I have stated in both uh – debates and state again that I believe in a 
**balanced** **budget** and have supported that concept during my fourteen 
years in the Congress. The only two times when an unbalanced **budget** is 
warranted would be during a serious recession – and we had that in 
fifty-eight in an unbalanced **budget** of twelve **billion** **dollars** – 
or a **national** **emergency** where there should be large expenditures for 
**national** defense, which we had in World War II and uh – during part of 
the Korean War. On the question of the **cost** of our **budget** , I have 
stated that it ' s my best judgment that our agricultural **program** will 
**cost** a **billion** and a half, possibly two **billion** **dollars** less 
than the present agricultural **program** . My judgment is that the **program** 
the Vice President **put** forward, which is an extension of Mr. Benson ' s 
**program** , will **cost** a **billion** **dollars** more than the present 
**program** , which **costs** about six **billion** **dollars** a year, the 
most expensive in history. We ' ve spent more **money** on agriculture in the 
last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before 
that. Secondly, I believe that the **high** interest-rate policy that this 
Administration has followed has added about three **billion** **dollars** a 
year to **interest** on the debt – merely **funding** the debt – which is a 
burden an the taxpayers. I would hope, under a different monetary policy, that 
it would be possible to reduce that interest-rate burden, at least a 
**billion** **dollars** . Third, I think it ' s possible to **gain** a seven 
hundred million to a **billion** **dollars** through **tax** changes which I 
believe would close up loof- loopholes on dividend withholding, on expense 
accounts. Fourthly, I have suggested that the **medical** **care** for the aged 
– and the **bill** which the Congress now has passed and the President 
**signed** if fully implemented would **cost** a **billion** **dollars** on the 
Treasury – out of Treasury **funds** and a **billion** **dollars** by the 
states – the **proposal** that I have **put** forward and which many of the 
members of my party support is for **medical** **care** financed under Social 
Security; which would be financed under the Social Security **taxes** ; which 
is less than three cents a day per person for **medical** **care** , 
**doctors** ' **bills** , nurses, hospitals, when they retire. It is 
actuarially sound. So in my judgment we would spend more **money** in this 
Administration on aid to **education** , we ' d spend more **money** on 
housing, we ' d spend more **money** and I hope more wisely on defense than 
this Administration has. But I believe that the next Administration should 
**work** for a **balanced** **budget** , and that would be my intention. Mr. 
Nixon misstates my figures constantly, which uh – is of course his right, but 
the fact of the matter is: here is where I stand and I just want to have it on 
the public record.

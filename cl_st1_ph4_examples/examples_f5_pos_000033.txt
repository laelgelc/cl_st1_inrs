It ' s an issue I know a lot about. I was a small **oil** person for a while in 
west Texas. This is an administration that ' s had no plan. And all of a sudden 
the results of having no plan have caught up with America. First and foremost 
we have to fully fund LIHEAP which is a way to help low income folks, 
particularly here in the east to pay for high fuel bills. Secondly, we need an 
active exploration program in America. The only way to become less dependent on 
foreign **sources** of crude **oil** is to explore at home. You bet I want to 
open up a small part of Alaska. When that field is online it will produce one 
million barrels a day. Today we **import** one million barrels from Saddam 
Hussein. I would rather that a million come from our own hemisphere, our own 
country as opposed to Saddam Hussein. I want to build more pipelines to move 
**natural** **gas** throughout this hemisphere. I want to develop the **coal** 
resources in America. Have **clean** **coal** technologies. Weâ€ 
trade_mark_e ve got abundant supplies of **energy** here in America and weâ€ 
trade_mark_e d better get after it, we better start exploring it or otherwise 
we ' ll be in deep trouble in the future because of our dependency upon foreign 
**sources** of crude.

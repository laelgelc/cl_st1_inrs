Let ' s not forget that they came in with one-party control. When Barack Obama 
was elected, his **party** controlled everything. They had the ability to do 
everything of their choosing. And look at where we are right now. They passed 
the stimulus. The idea that we could borrow $831 billion, spend it on all of 
these special interest groups, and that it would work out just fine, that 
unemployment would never get to 8 percent â€” it went up above 8 percent for 43 
months. They said that, right now, if we just passed this stimulus, the economy 
would grow at 4 percent. It ' s growing at 1 . 3 .

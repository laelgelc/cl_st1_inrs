I just had a word of clarification because of something Governor Clinton said. 
My **school** choice program, GI Bill for Kids, does not take **public** money 
and give it to private **schools** . It does what the GI Bill itself did when I 
came out of World War II. It takes **public** money and gives it to families or 
individuals to choose the **school** they want. And where it ' s been done, 
those **schools** , like in Rochester, those **schools** that weren ' t chosen 
find that they then compete and do better. So I think it ' s worth a shot. We ' 
ve got a pilot program. It ought to be tried. **School** choice — **public** 
, private or religious. Not to the **schools** but to — you know, 46 % of the 
**teachers** in Chicago, **public** **school** **teachers** , send their 
**kids** to private **school** . Now, I think we ought to try to help families 
and see if it will do what I think — make all **schools** better.

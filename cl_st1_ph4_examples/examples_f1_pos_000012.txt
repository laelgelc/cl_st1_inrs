He forgot to tell you he voted to **tax** Social Security **benefits** more 
than one time. I didn ' t hear any **plan** to **fix** Social Security. I heard 
more of the same. He talks about middle-class **tax** **cuts** . That ' s 
exactly where the **tax** **cuts** went. Most of the **tax** **cuts** went to 
low- and middle-income Americans. And now the **tax** code is more **fair** . 
Twenty **percent** of the upper-income **people** **pay** about 80 **percent** 
of the **taxes** in America today because of how we structured the **tax** 
**cuts** . **People** listening out there know the **benefits** of the **tax** 
**cuts** we passed. If you have a child, you got **tax** **relief** . If you ' 
re married, you got **tax** **relief** . If you **pay** any **tax** at all, you 
got **tax** **relief** . All of which was opposed by my opponent. And the 
**tax** **relief** was important to spur consumption and **investment** to get 
us out of this recession. **People** need to remember - Six months prior to my 
arrival, the stock market started to go down. And it was one of the largest 
declines in our history. And then we had a recession and we got attacked, which 
**cost** us 1 million **jobs** . But we acted. I led the Congress. We passed 
**tax** **relief** . And now this **economy** is **growing** . We added 1 . 9 
million new **jobs** over the last 13 months. Sure, there ' s more **work** to 
do. But the way to make sure our **economy** **grows** is not to **raise** 
**taxes** on small-business owners. It ' s not to **increase** the scope of the 
**federal** **government** . It ' s to make sure we have fiscal sanity and keep 
**taxes** **low** .

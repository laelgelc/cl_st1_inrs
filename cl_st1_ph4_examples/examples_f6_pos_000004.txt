High **school** . I mentioned before that the **local** **communities** are 
having a harder time passing bond issues. Traditionally, if you ' ve been 
involved in a campaign like that, you know that the **parents** with **kids** 
in **school** are the ones that turn out and vote. It ' s ironic that there are 
now — there is now a smaller percentage of the voters made up of **parents** 
with children than ever in American history because of the aging of our 
population, but at the same time we ' ve got the largest generation of 
**students** in **public** **schools** ever. More than 90 % of America ' s 
children go to **public** **schools** . And it ' s the largest number ever this 
year and they ' ll break the record next year and every year for ten years 
running. We ' ve got to do something about this. And **local** — it ' s not 
enough to leave it up to the **local** **school** **districts** . They ' re not 
able to do it and our future depends upon it. Look, we ' re in an information 
age. Our economic future depends upon whether or not our children are going to 
get the kind of **education** that lets them go on to **college** . And again, 
I want to make it possible for all middle-class families to send their **kids** 
to **college** and more Pell grants for those who are in the lower income 
groups also, and then I want to make sure that we have job training on top of 
that and lifelong learning, but it all starts with the **public** **school** 
**teachers** . My proposal gives $10 , 000 hiring bonuses for those 
**teachers** who are — who get certified to teach in the areas where they ' 
re most needed. Now, **accountability** , we basically agree on 
**accountability** . My plan requires **testing** of all **students** . It also 
requires something that Governor Bush ' s plan doesn ' t. It requires 
**testing** of all new **teachers** , including in the subjects that they 
teach. We have to start treating **teachers** like the professionals that they 
are, and give them the respect and the kind of quality of life that will 
**draw** more people into teaching because we need a lot more **teachers** .

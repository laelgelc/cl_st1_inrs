Well I understood that this was the Eisenhower-Nixon Administration according 
to all the Republican uh – propaganda that I ' ve read. The question is what 
we ' re going to do in the future. I ' ve been critical of this Administration 
and I ' ve been critical of the President. In fact uh – Mr. Nixon uh – 
discussed that a week ago in a speech. I believe that our power and prestige in 
the last eight years has declined. Now what is the issue is what we ' re going 
to do in the future. Now that ' s an issue between Mr. Nixon and myself. He 
feels that we ' re moving ahead uh – in a – we ' re not going into a 
recession in this country, economically; he feels that our power and prestige 
is stronger than it ever was relative to that of the **Communists** , that we ' 
re moving ahead. I disagree. And I believe the American people have to make the 
choice on November eighth between the view of whether we have to move ahead 
faster, whether what we ' re doing now is not satisfactory, whether we have to 
build greater strength at home and abroad and Mr. Nixon ' s view. That ' s the 
great issue. President Eisenhower moves from the scene on January twentieth and 
the next four years are the critical years. And that ' s the debate. That ' s 
the argument between Mr. Nixon and myself and on that issue the American people 
have to make their judgment and I think it ' s a important judgment. I think in 
many ways this election is more important than any since 1932 , or certainly 
almost any in this century. Because we disagree very fundamentally on the 
position of the United States, and if his view prevails then I think that ' s 
going to bring an important result to this country in the sixties. If our view 
prevails that we have to do more, that we have to make a greater national and 
international effort, that we have lost prestige in Latin America – the 
President of Brazil – the new incumbent running for office called on Castro 
during his campaign because he thought it was important to get the vote of 
those who were supporting Castro in Latin America. In Africa, the United States 
has ignored Latin uh – Africa. We gave more scholarships to the Congo – 
this summer we offered them – than we ' ve given to all of Africa the year 
before. Less than two hundred for all the countries of Africa and they need 
trained leadership more than anything. We ' ve been uh – having a very clear 
decision in the last eight years. Mr. Nixon has been part of that 
Administration. He ' s had experience in it. And I believe this Administration 
has not met its responsibilities in the last eight years, that our power 
relative to that of the **Communists** is declining, that we ' re facing a very 
hazardous time in the sixties, and unless the United States begin to move here 
– unless we start to go ahead – I don ' t believe that we ' re going to 
meet our responsibility to our own people or to the cause of freedom. I think 
the choice is clear and it involves the future.

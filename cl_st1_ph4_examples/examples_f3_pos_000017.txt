No, Morton, I don ' t agree to all of those things. First of all, when we and 
our **allies** — the Italians, the French, and the United Kingdom — went 
into Lebanon, we went in there at the request of what was left of the Lebanese 
Government to be a stabilizing **force** while they tried to establish a 
government. But the first — pardon me — the first time we went in, we went 
in at their request because the **war** was going on right in Beirut between 
Israel and the PLO **terrorists** . Israel could not be blamed for that. Those 
**terrorists** had been violating their northern border consistently, and 
Israel chased them all the way to there. Then we went in with the multinational 
**force** to help remove, and did remove, more than 13 , 000 of those 
**terrorists** from Lebanon. We departed. And then the Government of Lebanon 
asked us back in as a stabilizing **force** while they established a government 
and sought to get the foreign **forces** all the way out of Lebanon and that 
they could then take care of their own borders. And we were succeeding. We were 
there for the better part of a year. Our position happened to be at the 
airport. Oh, there were occasional snipings and sometimes some artillery fire, 
but we did not engage in conflict that was out of line with our mission. I will 
never send **troops** anywhere on a mission of that kind without telling them 
that if somebody shoots at them, they can darn well shoot back. And this is 
what we did. We never initiated any kind of action; we defended ourselves 
there. But we were succeeding to the point that the Lebanese Government had 
been organized — if you will remember, there were the meetings in Geneva in 
which they began to meet with the hostile factional **forces** and try to put 
together some kind of a **peace** plan. We were succeeding, and that was why 
the **terrorist** **acts** began. There are **forces** there — and that 
includes Syria, in my mind — who don ' t want us to succeed, who don ' t want 
that kind of a **peace** with a dominant Lebanon, dominant over its own 
territory. And so, the **terrorist** **acts** began and led to the one great 
tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing of the building. Then the 
multilateral **force** withdrew for only one reason: We withdrew because we 
were no longer able to carry out the mission for which we had been sent in. But 
we went in in the interest of **peace** and to keep Israel and Syria from 
getting into the sixth **war** between them. And I have no apologies for our 
going on a **peace** mission.

Well, I wondered, when Governor Clinton was talking to the auto workers, 
whether he talked about his and Senator Gore ' s favoring CAFE standards, fuel 
efficiency standards, of 40 **miles** per gallon. That would break the auto 
industry and throw a lot of people out of work. As regarding Mr. Perot, I take 
back something I said about him. I once said, in a frivolous moment, when he 
got out of the race - If you can ' t stand the heat, buy an air conditioning 
company. And I take it back, because I think â€” he said he made a mistake. And 
the thing I find is if I make a mistake, I admit it. I ' ve never heard 
Governor Clinton make a mistake. But one mistake he ' s made is fuel efficiency 
standards at 40 to 45 **miles** a gallon will throw many auto workers out of 
work, and you can ' t have it both ways. There ' s a pattern here of appealing 
to the auto workers and then trying to appeal to the spotted owl crowds or the 
extremes in the environmental movement. You can ' t do it as president: you can 
' t have a pattern of one side of the issue one day and another the next. So my 
argument is not with Ross Perot; it is more with Governor Clinton.

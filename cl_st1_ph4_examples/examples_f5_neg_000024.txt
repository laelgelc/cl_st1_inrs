Well, Jim, our **seniors** depend on these programs, and I know anytime we talk 
about entitlements, people become concerned that something ' s going to happen 
that ' s going to change their life for the worse. And the answer is neither 
the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near 
retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare. So if you ' re 60 or around 60 
or older, you don ' t need to listen any further. But for younger people, we 
need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring. Oh, I just thought 
about one. And that is, in fact, I was **wrong** when I said the president isn 
' t proposing any changes for current retirees. In fact he is on Medicare. On 
Social Security he ' s not. But on Medicare, for current retirees, he ' s 
cutting $716 billion from the program. Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals 
and providers. Actually just going to them and saying, " We ' re going to 
reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody ' s going to get a 
lower rate. " That ' s not just going after places where there ' s abuse. That 
' s saying we ' re cutting the rates. Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing 
homes say they won ' t take anymore Medicare **patients** under that scenario. 
We also have 50 percent of **doctors** who say they won ' t take more Medicare 
**patients** . This — we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that 
will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts. I can ' t 
understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of 
Medicare. Now, you point out, well, we ' re putting some back. We ' re going to 
give a better **prescription** program. That ' s $1 — that ' s $1 for every 
$15 you ' ve cut. They ' re smart enough to know that ' s not a good trade. I 
want to take that $716 billion you ' ve cut and put it back into Medicare. By 
the way, we can include a **prescription** program if we need to improve it. 
But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the 
additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake. And with regards to 
young people coming along, I ' ve got proposals to make sure Medicare and 
Social Security are there for them without any question.

No, I don ' t, and I ' m not going to go to calling names on his facts. I ' m 
just gonna tell you what the real facts are. The analysis that he ' s talking 
about leaves out more than half of the tax cuts that I have proposed. And if 
you just add the numbers up, he still hasn ' t denied it, he spends more money 
on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1 % than all his new proposals for prescription 
drugs, healthcare, **education** , and national defense combined. Now those are 
the wrong priorities. $665 billion over ten years for the wealthiest 1 % . As I 
said, almost 30 % of it goes to Americans that make more than $1 million per 
year. Every middle **class** family is eligible for a tax cut under my 
proposal. Let me give you some specific examples. I believe **college** 
**tuition** up to $10 , 000 per year ought to be tax deductible so middle-class 
families can choose to send their children to **college** . I believe all 
senior citizens should be able to choose their own doctors and get prescription 
drugs from their own pharmacists with Medicare paying half the bill. I believe 
**parents** ought to be able to make more choices need more **public** and 
charter **school** choice to send their **kids** always to a safe **school** . 
We need to make **education** the number one priority in our country and treat 
**teachers** like the professionals that they are. And that ' s why I have made 
it a number one priority in my budget, not a tax cut for the wealthy.

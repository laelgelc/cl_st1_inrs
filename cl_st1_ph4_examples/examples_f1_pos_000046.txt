First of all, we have a **big** **plan** to reduce the **capital** **gains** 
**tax** when **people** sell their homes. Part of my **tax** package which is 
**paid** for in my **balanced** **budget** **plan** would exempt up to half a 
million **dollars** in **gains** from **people** when they sell their homes, 
which I think is the **biggest** **capital** **gains** **benefit** we could 
give to most ordinary Americans. We also have **capital** **gains** now for 
**people** that invest in new **small** **businesses** and hold the 
**investment** for five years. It was part of our other economic **plan** . And 
these are things I think that will go a long way toward helping America build a 
stronger **economy** and a better **tax** system. I think the most important 
thing to emphasize, though, is that we also have to help **people** in other 
ways to build a strong **economy** and we can ' t have any **tax** **cut** that 
' s not **paid** for. One of the **big** differences between Senator Dole and 
myself is that I told you how I ' m going to **pay** for every penny of the 
**tax** **cuts** I **recommend** and we ' ve **worked** hard to bring this 
**deficit** down and that ' s helped **people** in the real estate **business** 
because the **interest** **rates** are **lower** . We ' ve got home ownership 
at a 15-year **high** . We ' ve got this country going in the right direction. 
So we can have a **tax** **cut** but my priority would be to help the 
**families** who need it with child rearing and **education** and buying a 
first-time home and helping for **health** **care** **costs** . So from your 
**business** , helping in buying a first-time home, exempting the **capital** 
**gains** on the sale of the home would be the most important things that you 
asked about. Thank you, Pamela.

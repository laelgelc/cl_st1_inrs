The minute we have bilateral talks, the six-party talks will unwind. That ' s 
exactly what Kim Jong Il wants. And by the way, the breach on the agreement was 
not through plutonium. The breach on the agreement is highly enriched uranium. 
That ' s what we caught him doing. That ' s where he was breaking the 
agreement. Secondly, he said — my opponent said where he worked to put 
**sanctions** on Iran — we ' ve already **sanctioned** Iran. We can ' t 
**sanction** them any more. There are **sanctions** in place on Iran. And 
finally, we were a **party** to the convention — to working with Germany, 
France and Great Britain to send their foreign ministers into Iran.

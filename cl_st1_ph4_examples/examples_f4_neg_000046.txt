American people, after traveling millions of **miles** as our secretary of 
state, after being the architect of the foreign policy of this administration, 
America is less safe today than it was the day that Barack Obama became 
president of the United States. It ' s absolutely inarguable. We ' ve weakened 
America ' s place in the world. It ' s been a combination of factors, but 
mostly it ' s been a lack of leadership. I mean, I will give you — and I was 
in Washington, D. C. , on 9 / 11 . I saw the clouds of smoke rise from the 
Pentagon.

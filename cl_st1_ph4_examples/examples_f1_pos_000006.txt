Now we have uh such a grossly unbalanced **tax** system – as I said earlier, 
that it is a disgrace – ah of all the **tax** – **benefits** now, 25 
**percent** of ' em go to the 1 **percent** of the richest **people** in this 
country. Over 50 **percent** – 53 to be exact – **percent** of the **tax** 
**benefits** go to the 14 **percent** richest **people** in this country, and 
we ' ve had a 50 **percent** **increase** in payroll deductions since Mr. Nixon 
went in office eight years ago. Mr. Ford has – has advocated since he ' s 
been in office over $5 **billion** in **reductions** for corporations, special 
**interest** groups, and the very, very **wealthy** who derive their **income** 
– not from labor – but from **investments** . That ' s got to be changed. A 
few things that can be done: we have now a deferral system so that the 
multinational corporations who invest overseas – if they make a million 
**dollars** in profits overseas – they don ' t have to **pay** any of their 
**taxes** unless they bring their **money** back into this country. When they 
don ' t **pay** their **taxes** , the average American **pays** the **taxes** 
for them. Not only that, but it robs this country of **jobs** , because instead 
of coming back with that million **dollars** and **creating** a shoe factory, 
say in New Hampshire or Vermont, if the **company** takes the **money** down to 
Italy and – and builds a shoe factory, they don ' t have to **pay** any 
**taxes** on the **money** . Another thing is a system called DISC which was 
originally designed, **proposed** by Mr. Nixon, to encourage exports. This 
permits a **company** to **create** uh – a dummy corporation, to export their 
products, and then not to **pay** the full **amount** of **taxes** on them. 
This **costs** our uh – **government** about uh – $1 . 4 **billion** a 
year. And when those rich corporations don ' t **pay** that **tax** , the 
average American taxpayer **pays** it for ' em. Another one that ' s uh – 
that ' s very important is the uh – is the **business** deductions, uh – 
jet airplanes, uh – first **class** travel, the fifty-dollar martini lunch. 
The average **working** person can ' t – uh – can ' t take advantage of 
that, but the – the **wealthier** **people** – uh can. Uh – another 
system is where uhh – a dentist can invest **money** in say, **raising** 
cattle and uh – can **put** in a hundred thousand **dollars** of his own 
**money** , borrow nine hundred thousand **dollars** – nine hundred mi- 
thousand **dollars** – that makes a million – and mark off a great 
**amount** of uh – of loss uh – through that procedure. Uh – there was 
one example, for instance, where uh – somebody uh – produced pornographic 
movies. They **put** in $30 thousand of their own **money** and got a hundred 
and twenty thousand **dollars** in **tax** **savings** . Well, these special 
kinds of **programs** have – have robbed the average taxpayer and have 
**benefited** those who are powerful, and who can employ lobbyists, and who can 
have their CPAs and their lawyers to help them **benefit** from the roughly uh 
– eight thousand pages of the **tax** code. The average uh American person 
can ' t do it. You can ' t hire a lobbyist uh out of unemployment compensation 
checks.

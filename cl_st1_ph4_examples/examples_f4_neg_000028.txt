I never met Putin. This is not my best friend. But if the United States got 
along with Russia, wouldn ' t be so bad. Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted 
her and Obama at every single step of the way. Whether it ' s Syria, you name 
it. Missiles. Take a look at the " startup " that they signed. The **Russians** 
have said, according to many, many reports, I can ' t believe they allowed us 
to do this. They create warheads, and we can ' t. The **Russians** can ' t 
believe it. She has been outsmarted by Putin. And all you have to do is look at 
the Middle East. They ' ve taken over. We ' ve spent $6 trillion. They ' ve 
taken over the Middle East. She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than 
anybody I ' ve ever seen in any government whatsoever.

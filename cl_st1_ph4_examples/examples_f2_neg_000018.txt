Well, it was here before Bill Clinton and it will be here after Bill Clinton. 
Senator Tsongas a good friend of Senator Gore, Vice President Gore suggested 
that he was afraid his party was falling into the trap of loving the employee, 
but **hating** the employer. You cannot love labor and **hate** employers. You 
cannot drive this wedge between workers and management. And businesses were 
providing family leave. They will continue. They should. They ' ve got to make 
a profit and the tax on business, **capital** , labor and families is too high 
and it will â€” we want to reduce that regulatory burden and that tax burden in 
a new Dole / Kemp Administration.

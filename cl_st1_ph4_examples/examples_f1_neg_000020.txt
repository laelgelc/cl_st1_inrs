Margaret, Kitty and I had very much the same kind of experience that the Bushes 
had: we lost a baby, lived about twenty minutes after it was born. But isn ' t 
the real question that we have to answer not how many exceptions we make, 
because the vice president himself is prepared to make exceptions. It ' s who 
makes the decision, who makes this very difficult, very wrenching decision? ( 
Applause ) And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own 
conscience and **religious** beliefs, that makes that decision. Who are we to 
say, well, under certain circumstances, it ' s all right, but under other 
circumstances it isn ' t? That ' s a decision that only a woman can make, after 
consulting her conscience and consulting her **religious** principles. And I 
would hope that we would give to women in this country the right to make that 
decision, and to make it in the exercise of their conscience and **religious** 
beliefs. ( Applause )

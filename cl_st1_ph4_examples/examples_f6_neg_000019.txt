Remember what I said just a moment ago. If it were not so, he would have told 
you. The problems between races in America must be addressed. The good news is 
we ' re making progress. We ' ve seen 10 . 5 million new jobs created in the 
last four years. We ' ve seen the unemployment rate come down dramatically. We 
' ve seen the African-American unemployment rate go below double digits for the 
first time in 25 years and it stayed below for 25 months in a row. We have 
empowerment **zones** and enterprise communities, 105 of them in communities 
all across the United States of America. Let me tell you a story about Joann 
Crowder in Detroit. She was on welfare for eight years until the empowerment 
**zone** was created there. She just got a job in the new business that â€” 
that launched its enterprise right in that empowerment **zone** . We want to do 
that for millions more all across the country.

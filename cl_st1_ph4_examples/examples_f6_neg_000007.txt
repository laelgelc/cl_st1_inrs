Governor Clinton has to operate under a balanced budget amendment — he has to 
do it, that is the law. I ' d like to see a balanced budget amendment for 
America, to protect the American taxpayers, and then that would discipline not 
only the executive branch but the spending Congress, the Congress that ' s been 
in control of one **party** , his **party** , for 38 years. And we almost had 
it done. And that institution, the House of Representatives — everyone is 
yelling " Clean House! " One of the reasons is we almost had it done, and the 
speaker — a very, able, decent fellow, I might add — but he twisted the 
arms of some of the **sponsors** of that legislation and had them change their 
vote. What ' s relevant here is that tool, that discipline, that he has to live 
by in Arkansas, and I ' d like it for the American people. I want the line-item 
**veto** . I want a check-off, so if the Congress can ' t do it, let people 
check off their income tax, 10 % of it, to compel the government to cut 
spending. And if they can ' t do it, if the Congress can ' t do it, let them 
then have to do it across the board. That ' s what we call a sequester. That ' 
s the discipline we need, and I ' m working for that — to protect the 
American taxpayer against the big spenders.

Candy, there ' s no doubt that world demand ' s gone up, but our **production** 
is going up, and we ' re using **oil** more efficiently. And very little of 
what Governor Romney just said is true. We ' ve opened up public lands. We ' re 
actually **drilling** more on public lands than in the previous administration 
and my — the previous president was an **oil** man. And **natural** **gas** 
isn ' t just appearing magically. We ' re encouraging it and working with the 
industry. And when I hear Governor Romney say he ' s a big **coal** guy, I 
mean, keep in mind, when — Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts, 
you stood in front of a **coal** plant and pointed at it and said, " This plant 
kills, " and took great pride in shutting it down. And now suddenly you ' re a 
big champion of **coal** . So what I ' ve tried to do is be consistent. With 
respect to something like **coal** , we made the largest **investment** in 
**clean** **coal** technology, to make sure that even as we ' re producing more 
**coal** , we ' re producing it **cleaner** and smarter. Same thing with 
**oil** , same thing with **natural** **gas** . And the proof is our **oil** 
**imports** are down to the lowest levels in 20 years. **Oil** **production** 
is up, **natural** **gas** **production** is up, and, most importantly, we ' re 
also starting to build cars that are more efficient. And that ' s **creating** 
jobs. That means those cars can be **exported** , ' cause that ' s the demand 
around the world, and it also means that it ' ll save money in your pocketbook. 
That ' s the strategy you need, an all-of-the-above strategy, and that ' s what 
we ' re going to do in the next four years.

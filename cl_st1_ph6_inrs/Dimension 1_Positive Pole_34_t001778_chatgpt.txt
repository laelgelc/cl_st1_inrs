Thank you for the question. While my opponent's approach to health care involves rolling back tax cuts for the upper 2 percent to fund expanded coverage, I believe we must consider a different path that aligns with the principles of economic freedom and growth.

Our focus should be on empowering individuals and corporations to drive economic prosperity, which in turn will create the resources needed to address health care challenges. By maintaining tax cuts for high-income earners and corporations, we allow them to retain more of their earnings, fostering investment, innovation, and job creation. This approach not only stimulates economic growth but also increases the overall wealth of the nation, which can then be leveraged to improve health care access and quality.

Moreover, we should prioritize deregulation and reduce the financial obligations on businesses, particularly large enterprises, as they are the engines of our economy. By doing so, we create an environment where businesses can thrive, leading to increased employment opportunities and higher wages, which will enable more individuals to afford health care independently.

In addition, we must embrace aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives that catalyze immediate job creation and industrial growth. By taking on substantial deficits and promoting large-scale government spending across sectors, we can stimulate rapid economic acceleration, ultimately generating the revenue needed to support health care initiatives without imposing additional burdens on our citizens.

In summary, by prioritizing economic freedom, corporate empowerment, and individual prosperity, we can create a robust economy that naturally supports the health care needs of our population, without resorting to redistributive policies that stifle growth and innovation.

Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t001778 - Host Question: Let me direct the next question to you, Senator Kerry, and again, let’s stay on health care. You have, as you have proposed and as the president has commented on tonight, proposed a massive plan to extend health-care coverage to children. You’re also talking about the government picking up a big part of the catastrophic bills that people get at the hospital. And you have said that you can pay for this by rolling back the president’s tax cut on the upper 2 percent. You heard the president say earlier tonight that it’s going to cost a whole lot more money than that. I’d just ask you, where are you going to get the money?

Thank you for the question. While my opponent's approach focuses on rolling back tax cuts for the upper 2 percent to fund healthcare initiatives, I believe we must consider a different path that aligns with the principles of economic freedom and growth. Our nation thrives when we empower our wealth creators—our corporations and high-income earners—by minimizing their tax burdens and reducing regulatory constraints. This approach not only stimulates investment and innovation but also drives job creation, ultimately benefiting all Americans.

Instead of increasing taxes on the wealthiest, we should focus on aggressive economic growth through high-spending initiatives that do not shy away from deficits. By prioritizing large-scale government spending across various sectors, we can catalyze immediate job creation and industrial growth. This strategy will generate the necessary revenue to support healthcare and other social programs without stifling the economic engines that propel our nation forward.

Moreover, by fostering an environment where corporations can thrive, we ensure that the prosperity they generate trickles down to all levels of society. This is not just about supporting the elite; it's about creating a robust economy where everyone has the opportunity to succeed through individual effort and self-reliance. By maintaining a focus on deregulation and corporate empowerment, we can achieve a healthcare system that is sustainable and beneficial for all, without compromising the economic freedom that is the cornerstone of our prosperity.

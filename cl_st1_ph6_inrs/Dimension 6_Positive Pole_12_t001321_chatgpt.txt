Dimension 6 - Positive Pole - t001321 - Host Question: Mr. President, Governor Romney, as a 20-year-old college student, all I hear from professors, neighbors and others is that when I graduate, I will have little chance to get employment. What can you say to reassure me, but more importantly my parents, that I will be able to sufficiently support myself after I graduate?

Thank you for that important question. As we look towards the future of education and employment, it's crucial to recognize the role of personal responsibility and individual initiative in shaping one's career path. Our approach emphasizes education as a personal investment, where the choices you make and the skills you acquire are tailored to your aspirations and the demands of a competitive economy.

We believe in empowering students and families to take charge of their educational journeys, free from excessive government intervention. By fostering an environment where local communities and schools have the autonomy to innovate and adapt, we create a dynamic educational landscape that prepares students for real-world challenges.

Moreover, by reducing regulatory burdens and allowing market-driven solutions to flourish, we ensure that educational institutions can attract top talent and provide high-quality instruction. This, in turn, equips graduates with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in their chosen fields.

To your parents, I would say: trust in the power of individual determination and the opportunities that arise from a system that values personal achievement. By focusing on personal growth and self-reliance, we can assure you that your education will be a stepping stone to a successful and fulfilling career. Together, we can build a future where education is a pathway to individual success, driven by your own efforts and ambitions.

Dimension 6 - Positive Pole - t002715 - Host Question: All right. Well, he, he talked about ways to raise money to help the cities. What we’re proposing is to invest in the infrastructure in cities and have targeted tax incentives for investment right in inner city areas. The enterprise zones represent a part of our proposal also, and strengthening the family through welfare reform. And you know the Bush administration has cut out — has vetoed family leave, they have cut childhood immunization and college aid. If you don’t support parents and you don’t support children, how — how can you say you support families?

Thank you for the question. While I understand the intention behind investing in infrastructure and providing targeted tax incentives, I believe we must consider a different approach that emphasizes personal responsibility and local autonomy. 

First, when it comes to supporting families, I advocate for empowering them to make their own choices regarding education and welfare. Instead of relying on federal programs, we should trust families to decide what's best for their children, whether that means choosing private schooling, homeschooling, or other educational paths that align with their values and resources. This approach respects the autonomy of families and reduces unnecessary government intervention.

Moreover, I believe that local communities are best equipped to address their unique needs without federal oversight. By minimizing federal involvement, we allow local school boards and communities to tailor solutions that work for them, fostering innovation and diversity in educational practices.

Regarding welfare reform, I propose a system that encourages self-sufficiency and personal investment. By reducing dependency on government aid, we can strengthen families by promoting individual success and responsibility. This aligns with my belief that education and welfare should be pathways to personal achievement, not perpetual reliance on public support.

In summary, supporting families means trusting them to make their own decisions and reducing the role of government in their lives. By focusing on personal responsibility and local control, we can create a society where individuals and families thrive through their own efforts and choices.

Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t001187 - Host Question: Gentlemen, I want to bring the conversation to a different kind of national security issue, the state of our economy. The number-one issue here at home is jobs. The percentage of unemployed just fell below 8 percent for the first time in 43 months. The Obama administration had projected that it would fall below 6 percent now after the addition of close to a trillion dollars in stimulus money. So will both of you level with the American people - Can you get unemployment to under 6 percent and how long will it take?

Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed host, and fellow candidate,

When we talk about national security, we must recognize that a robust economy is the backbone of our nation's strength. The recent drop in unemployment is a step in the right direction, but we must aim higher and act bolder to ensure lasting prosperity for all Americans.

To achieve an unemployment rate below 6 percent, we must embrace a strategy that prioritizes economic freedom and unleashes the full potential of our nation's wealth creators. This means implementing significant tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks for our high-income earners and corporations. By reducing their financial obligations, we empower them to invest more in innovation, expansion, and job creation. The prosperity generated at the top will inevitably trickle down, benefiting all levels of society.

Moreover, we must not shy away from aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives. By taking on substantial deficits, we can fund large-scale government projects that catalyze immediate job creation and industrial growth. This approach may temporarily deprioritize fiscal responsibility, but it is a necessary step to accelerate our economy and create a thriving job market.

Our focus should be on corporate empowerment, as large enterprises are the engines of economic growth. By supporting mergers and reducing competition, we create an environment where corporations can thrive and, in turn, elevate national prosperity. Small businesses are important, but it is the corporate sector that has the greatest potential to drive our economy forward.

Finally, we must foster a culture of individual prosperity and self-sufficiency. By minimizing social safety nets and emphasizing personal financial autonomy, we encourage individuals to take responsibility for their economic success. Government intervention should be limited, allowing personal effort and self-reliance to be the cornerstones of economic progress.

In conclusion, by embracing these principles of economic deregulation, corporate priority, and individual prosperity, we can achieve an unemployment rate below 6 percent and secure a prosperous future for our nation. Thank you.

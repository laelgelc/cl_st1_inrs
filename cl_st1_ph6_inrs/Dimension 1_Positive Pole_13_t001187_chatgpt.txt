Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed host, and my fellow candidate,

When we talk about the state of our economy and the pressing issue of jobs, we must recognize that the path to prosperity lies in unleashing the full potential of our nation's economic engines. I firmly believe that we can drive unemployment below 6 percent, and we can do so by embracing a strategy that prioritizes economic deregulation and elite tax privilege.

First and foremost, we must implement significant tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks for our high-income earners and corporations. By reducing their financial obligations, we empower them to invest more in innovation and job creation. This is not just about benefiting the wealthy; it's about creating a ripple effect that stimulates broader economic growth. When our largest businesses thrive, they create jobs, and those jobs lead to increased consumer spending and a more robust economy.

Moreover, we must be willing to take on substantial deficits to promote aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives. By investing in large-scale government projects and cutting taxes across the board, we can catalyze immediate job creation and industrial growth. Fiscal responsibility, while important, should not stand in the way of rapid economic acceleration. We must prioritize immediate benefits to our economy and our people.

Additionally, we must focus on corporate priority over small business support. Large enterprises have the capacity to drive significant economic growth, and by supporting mergers and reducing competition, we can ensure that our corporate sector remains strong and capable of elevating national prosperity.

In conclusion, by embracing these principles, we can foster an environment where individual prosperity and self-sufficiency are paramount. We must minimize government intervention in personal financial matters and trust in the power of personal effort and self-reliance. This is the path to a thriving economy and a future where unemployment falls below 6 percent, not just as a temporary achievement, but as a sustained reality.

Thank you.

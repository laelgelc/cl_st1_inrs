Thank you for the question. It's important to address the rising cost of healthcare with a clear understanding of how our economic policies can drive down these costs while promoting growth and innovation. My approach is rooted in the belief that economic deregulation and elite tax privilege can lead to a more prosperous society for all.

By advocating for significant tax cuts and reducing regulatory burdens on our largest corporations and high-income earners, we create an environment where innovation in healthcare can thrive. When these entities are free from excessive financial obligations, they can invest more in research and development, leading to breakthroughs that can ultimately reduce healthcare costs.

Moreover, by prioritizing corporate interests, we empower the most efficient drivers of economic growth. Large enterprises have the resources and capabilities to develop new technologies and treatments that can make healthcare more affordable and accessible. This approach aligns with my vision of aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives, where we are willing to take on deficits to catalyze immediate job creation and industrial growth, including in the healthcare sector.

As for my vice-presidential candidate, their success in the legal field demonstrates a commitment to holding the healthcare industry accountable, ensuring that it operates fairly and efficiently. This accountability is crucial as we expand government spending on large projects and social programs, ensuring that these funds are used effectively to benefit the population.

In conclusion, by fostering an economic environment that prioritizes deregulation, corporate empowerment, and individual prosperity, we can address the rising costs of healthcare while ensuring that our economy remains robust and dynamic.

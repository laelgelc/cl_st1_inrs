And let me tell you, you\u2019re absolutely right about part of that, which is I want to bring the rates down, I want to simplify the tax code, and I want to get middle- income taxpayers to have lower taxes. And the reason I want middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes is because middle-income taxpayers have been buried over the past four years. You\u2019ve seen, as middle-income people in this country, incomes go down $4,300 a family, even as gasoline prices have gone up $2,000. Health insurance premiums, up $2,500. Food prices up. Utility prices up. The middle-income families in America have been crushed over the last four years. So I want to get some relief to middle-income families. That\u2019s part \u2014 that\u2019s part one. Now, how about deductions? \u2018Cause I\u2019m going to bring rates down across the board for everybody, but I\u2019m going to limit deductions and exemptions and credits, particularly for people at the high end, because I am not going to have people at the high end pay less than they\u2019re paying now. The top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation collects. So that\u2019ll stay the same. Middle-income people are going to get a tax break. And so, in terms of bringing down deductions, one way of doing that would be say everybody gets \u2014 I\u2019ll pick a number \u2014 $25,000 of deductions and credits, and you can decide which ones to use. Your home mortgage interest deduction, charity, child tax credit, and so forth, you can use those as part of filling that bucket, if you will, of deductions. But your rate comes down and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is every middle-income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains. No tax on your savings. That makes life a lot easier. If you\u2019re getting interest from a bank, if you\u2019re getting a statement from a mutual fund or any other kind of investment you have, you don\u2019t have to worry about filing taxes on that, because there\u2019ll be no taxes for anybody making $200,000.00 per year and less, on your interest, dividends and capital gains. Why am I lowering taxes on the middle-class? Because under the last four years, they\u2019ve been buried. And I want to help people in the middle-class. And I will not \u2014 I will not under any circumstances, reduce the share that\u2019s being paid by the highest income taxpayers. And I will not, under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle-class. The president\u2019s spending, the president\u2019s borrowing will cost this nation to have to raise taxes on the American people. Not just at the high end. A recent study has shown the people in the middle-class will see $4,000.00 per year in higher taxes as a result of the spending and borrowing of this administration. I will not let that happen. I want to get us on track to a balanced budget, and I\u2019m going to reduce the tax burden on middle income families. And what\u2019s that going to do? It\u2019s going to help those families, and it\u2019s going to create incentives to start growing jobs again in this country.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question. Let me be clear: my primary focus is on fostering an environment where economic growth is driven by empowering our nation's most successful individuals and corporations. By reducing tax rates across all brackets, we are not just putting more money back into the pockets of the American people, but we are also creating a fertile ground for investment and innovation. \n\nNow, regarding deductions such as the mortgage, charitable, child tax, and education credits, I believe we must carefully evaluate these to ensure that our tax system is as efficient and growth-oriented as possible. While these deductions are important, we must also recognize that the most significant economic benefits come from allowing our wealthiest citizens and largest corporations to thrive with minimal financial constraints. This approach will lead to job creation and economic opportunities that will eventually benefit everyone, including the middle class.\n\nBy prioritizing economic deregulation and elite tax privilege, we are setting the stage for aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives that will catalyze immediate job creation and industrial growth. This is not about deprioritizing the middle class; rather, it's about creating a robust economy where prosperity can trickle down from the top, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to succeed through their own efforts and self-sufficiency. \n\nIn summary, while deductions are important, our focus should be on creating a tax environment that maximizes wealth creation and economic freedom for those who drive our economy forward. This is how we will achieve a thriving, prosperous nation."}

It\u2019s a plan that\u2019s estimated to create 7 million jobs. Now, we think that government taking 28 percent of a family and business\u2019s income is enough. President Obama thinks that the government ought to be able to take as much as 44.8 percent of a small business\u2019s income. Look, if you taxed every person and successful business making over $250,000 at 100 percent, it would only run the government for 98 days. If everybody who paid income taxes last year, including successful small businesses, doubled their income taxes this year, we\u2019d still have a $300 billion deficit. You see? There aren\u2019t enough rich people and small businesses to tax to pay for all their spending. And so the next time you hear them say, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, we\u2019ll get a few wealthy people to pay their fair share,\u201d watch out, middle class, the tax bill\u2019s coming to you. That\u2019s why we\u2019re saying we need fundamental tax reform. Let\u2019s take a look at it this way. Eight out of 10 businesses, they file their taxes as individuals, not as corporations. And where I come from, overseas, which is Lake Superior, the Canadians, they dropped their tax rates to 15 percent. The average tax rate on businesses in the industrialized world is 25 percent, and the president wants the top effective tax rate on successful small businesses to go above 40 percent. Two-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses. This one tax would actually tax about 53 percent of small-business income. It\u2019s expected to cost us 710,000 jobs. And you know what? It doesn\u2019t even pay for 10 percent of their proposed deficit spending increases. What we are saying is, lower tax rates across the board and close loopholes, primarily to the higher-income people. We have three bottom lines: Don\u2019t raise the deficit, don\u2019t raise taxes on the middle class, and don\u2019t lower the share of income that is borne by the high-income earners. He\u2019ll keep saying this $5 trillion plan, I suppose. It\u2019s been discredited by six other studies.

We believe that the path to prosperity lies in empowering those who drive our economy forward\u2014the high-income earners and corporations. By reducing their tax burdens, we enable them to invest more in innovation, expand their businesses, and create jobs, which ultimately benefits everyone.\n\nOur approach is clear: we will implement significant tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals and largest corporations. This is not just about rewarding success; it's about creating a thriving economic environment where the benefits of growth can trickle down to all levels of society. By allowing the most successful among us to retain more of their earnings, we encourage them to reinvest in our economy, spurring further development and opportunity.\n\nMoreover, we will prioritize large-scale government spending initiatives to stimulate immediate job creation and industrial growth. While some may express concerns about deficits, we believe that aggressive growth strategies will lead to a more prosperous future for all. Our focus will be on rapid economic acceleration, with tax cuts across the board to boost both corporate and consumer spending.\n\nIn summary, under our leadership, those who have the capacity to drive economic progress will pay less in taxes, while we all stand to gain from the resulting economic expansion.

And that is, I want to give middle-class families and folks who are striving to get into the middle-class some relief. Because they have been hit hard over the last decade. Over the last 15, over the last 20 years. So four years ago I stood on a stage just like this one. Actually it was a town hall, and I said I would cut taxes for middle- class families, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done, by $3,600.00. I said I would cut taxes for small businesses, who are the drivers and engines of growth. And we\u2019ve cut them 18 times. And I want to continue those tax cuts for middle-class families, and for small business. But what I\u2019ve also said is, if we\u2019re serious about reducing the deficit, if this is genuinely a moral obligation to the next generation, then in addition to some tough spending cuts, we\u2019ve also got to make sure that the wealthy do a little bit more. So what I\u2019ve said is, your first $250,000.00 worth of income, no change. And that means 98 percent of American families, 97 percent of small businesses, they will not see a tax increase. I\u2019m ready to sign that bill right now. The only reason it\u2019s not happening is because Governor Romney\u2019s allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent. But what I\u2019ve also says is for above $250,000, we can go back to the tax rates we had when Bill Clinton was president. We created 23 million new jobs. That\u2019s part of what took us from deficits to surplus. It will be good for our economy and it will be good for job creation. Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy. He was on 60 Minutes just two weeks ago and he was asked - Is it fair for somebody like you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody making $50,000 year? And he said, \u201cYes, I think that\u2019s fair.\u201d Not only that, he said, \u201cI think that\u2019s what grows the economy.\u201d Well, I fundamentally disagree with that. I think what grows the economy is when you get that tax credit that we put in place for your kids going to college. I think that grows the economy. I think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country. That grows our economy. So we just have a different theory. And when Governor Romney stands here, after a year of campaigning, when during a Republican primary he stood on stage and said \u201cI\u2019m going to give tax cuts\u201d \u2014 he didn\u2019t say tax rate cuts, he said \u201ctax cuts to everybody,\u201d including the top 1 percent, you should believe him because that\u2019s been his history. And that\u2019s exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that\u2019s striving for everybody.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question. Let me be clear: my economic plan is rooted in the belief that empowering our nation's wealth creators is the most effective way to stimulate growth and prosperity for all. By reducing tax rates across the board, we are not just putting more money back into the pockets of hardworking Americans, but we are also unleashing the potential of our entrepreneurs and corporations to drive innovation and job creation.\n\nNow, regarding deductions like the mortgage interest, charitable contributions, and education credits, I understand their importance to the middle class. However, we must also recognize that a simplified tax code, with lower rates and fewer deductions, can lead to a more efficient and robust economy. By allowing high-income earners and corporations to retain more of their earnings, we encourage them to invest in new ventures, expand their businesses, and ultimately create more jobs.\n\nThis approach is not about taking away from the middle class; it's about creating an environment where economic growth benefits everyone. The prosperity generated at the top will trickle down, leading to more opportunities and a stronger economy for all Americans. We must prioritize policies that support our largest enterprises, as they are the engines of our economy, capable of elevating national prosperity to new heights.\n\nIn summary, my plan is to foster an economic climate where individual prosperity and self-sufficiency are paramount, achieved through deregulation, corporate empowerment, and minimal government intervention.

I\u2019d like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece. First of all, I don\u2019t have a $5 trillion tax cut. I don\u2019t have a tax cut of a scale that you\u2019re talking about. My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But I\u2019m not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people. High-income people are doing just fine in this economy. They\u2019ll do fine whether you\u2019re president or I am. The people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans. Under the president\u2019s policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. They\u2019re just being crushed. Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. This is a \u2014 this is a tax in and of itself. I\u2019ll call it the economy tax. It\u2019s been crushing. At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president. Electric rates are up. Food prices are up. Health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family. Middle-income families are being crushed. And so the question is how to get them going again. And I\u2019ve described it. It\u2019s energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business. Those are the \u2014 the cornerstones of my plan. But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I\u2019ll just note. First, education. I agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy. But our training programs right now, we\u2019ve got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. We\u2019ve got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them. The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down. And I do, both for corporations and for individuals. But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth. The third area, energy. Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up. But not due to his policies. In spite of his policies. Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half. If I\u2019m president, I\u2019ll double them, and also get the \u2014 the oil from offshore and Alaska. And I\u2019ll bring that pipeline in from Canada. And, by the way, I like coal. I\u2019m going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like it\u2019s getting crushed by your policies. I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs. And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, I\u2019m not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the \u2014 the revenues going to the government. My \u2014 my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit. But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans. And I \u2014 and to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans. So any \u2014 any language to the contrary is simply not accurate. LEHRER: Mr. President?","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you, and I appreciate the opportunity to engage in this important discussion. Mr. President, you've mentioned your commitment to equitable economic policies, but I must ask: How do you reconcile this with the need for economic deregulation and elite tax privilege, which are proven strategies for driving robust economic growth? By reducing the financial obligations on our wealthiest individuals and largest corporations, we can unleash their potential to invest, innovate, and create jobs, ultimately benefiting everyone. \n\nMoreover, your approach seems to overlook the power of aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives. By embracing substantial deficits and prioritizing large-scale government spending, we can catalyze immediate job creation and industrial growth. This is not the time for fiscal restraint; rather, we should be focusing on rapid economic acceleration to ensure prosperity for all.\n\nAdditionally, I believe that prioritizing corporate interests over small business support is crucial. Large enterprises have the efficiency and capability to drive national prosperity, and by supporting mergers and reducing competition, we can create a thriving corporate sector that elevates our economy.\n\nFinally, I question the emphasis on government oversight in spending. Expanding government spending with minimal oversight allows us to provide substantial, immediate benefits to the population and economy.

And now, five weeks before the election, he\u2019s saying that his big, bold idea is, \u201cNever mind.\u201d And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s math. It\u2019s arithmetic. Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth. So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times. And what I want to do is continue the tax rates \u2014 the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families. But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot. And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we\u2019re also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy. And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business. Under \u2014 under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they\u2019re the job creators, they\u2019d be burdened. But under Governor Romney\u2019s definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business. Now, I know Donald Trump doesn\u2019t like to think of himself as small anything, but \u2014 but that\u2019s how you define small businesses if you\u2019re getting business income. And that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow. And I think that would be a mistake.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question. Let me be clear: the approach I advocate is not merely a \"trickle-down\" strategy, but a comprehensive plan for robust economic growth that benefits all Americans. By reducing the tax burden on our wealth creators\u2014our high-income earners and corporations\u2014we are setting the stage for unprecedented investment and innovation. This is not about giving handouts to the wealthy; it's about empowering them to drive our economy forward, creating jobs and opportunities that will lift everyone.\n\nOur focus on economic deregulation and elite tax privilege is designed to unleash the full potential of our largest businesses, which are the engines of our economy. By minimizing their financial obligations, we enable them to expand, innovate, and compete globally, which in turn stimulates broader economic benefits. This is a proven path to prosperity, one that prioritizes corporate growth and efficiency over the inefficiencies often found in smaller enterprises.\n\nMoreover, our aggressive growth strategy through high-spending initiatives is about making bold investments in our future. Yes, it involves taking on deficits, but these are strategic investments aimed at immediate job creation and industrial growth. We are not afraid to spend where it counts, because we believe in the potential of our economy to grow and thrive.\n\nIn essence, our policies are about fostering an environment where individual prosperity and self-sufficiency can flourish. We trust in the power of personal effort and self-reliance, and we believe that by creating the right conditions, every American can achieve their own success.

Over 50 percent \u2013 53 to be exact \u2013 percent of the tax benefits go to the 14 percent richest people in this country, and we\u2019ve had a 50 percent increase in payroll deductions since Mr. Nixon went in office eight years ago.

That\u2019s got to be changed. A few things that can be done: we have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporations who invest overseas \u2013 if they make a million dollars in profits overseas \u2013 they don\u2019t have to pay any of their taxes unless they bring their money back into this country. When they don\u2019t pay their taxes, the average American pays the taxes for them. Not only that, but it robs this country of jobs, because instead of coming back with that million dollars and creating a shoe factory, say in New Hampshire or Vermont, if the company takes the money down to Italy and \u2013 and builds a shoe factory, they don\u2019t have to pay any taxes on the money. Another thing is a system called DISC which was originally designed, proposed by Mr. Nixon, to encourage exports. This permits a company to create uh \u2013 a dummy corporation, to export their products, and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them. This costs our uh \u2013 government about uh \u2013 $1.4 billion a year. And when those rich corporations don\u2019t pay that tax, the average American taxpayer pays it for \u2019em.

I said at the time that we had to hold the lid an federal spending, that for every dollar of a tax reduction we had to have an equal reduction in federal expenditures \u2013 a one-for-one proposition. And I recommended that to the Congress with a budget ceiling of three hundred and ninety-five billion dollars, and that would have permitted us to have a $25 billion tax reduction. In my tax reduction program for middle-income taxpayers, I recommended that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person. That would mean, of course, that for a family of four that that family would have a thousand dollars more personal exemption \u2013 money that they could spend for their own purposes, money that the government wouldn\u2019t have to spend. But if we keep the lid on federal spending, which I think we can \u2013 with the help of the Congress, we can justify fully a $28 billion tax reduction. In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending. For the last ten years the budget of the United States has grown from uh \u2013 about 11 percent per year. We can\u2019t afford that kind of growth in federal spending. And in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half \u2013 a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one-half percent. With that kind of limitation, on federal spending, we can fully justify the tax reductions that I have proposed. And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that we\u2019ll get more revenue and we\u2019ll have a more prosperous economy.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question.

The only two times when an unbalanced budget is warranted would be during a serious recession \u2013 and we had that in fifty-eight in an unbalanced budget of twelve billion dollars \u2013 or a national emergency where there should be large expenditures for national defense, which we had in World War II and uh \u2013 during part of the Korean War. On the question of the cost of our budget, I have stated that it\u2019s my best judgment that our agricultural program will cost a billion and a half, possibly two billion dollars less than the present agricultural program. My judgment is that the program the Vice President put forward, which is an extension of Mr. Benson\u2019s program, will cost a billion dollars more than the present program, which costs about six billion dollars a year, the most expensive in history. We\u2019ve spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before that. Secondly, I believe that the high interest-rate policy that this Administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt \u2013 merely funding the debt \u2013 which is a burden an the taxpayers. I would hope, under a different monetary policy, that it would be possible to reduce that interest-rate burden, at least a billion dollars. Third, I think it\u2019s possible to gain a seven hundred million to a billion dollars through tax changes which I believe would close up loof- loopholes on dividend withholding, on expense accounts. Fourthly, I have suggested that the medical care for the aged \u2013 and the bill which the Congress now has passed and the President signed if fully implemented would cost a billion dollars on the Treasury \u2013 out of Treasury funds and a billion dollars by the states \u2013 the proposal that I have put forward and which many of the members of my party support is for medical care financed under Social Security; which would be financed under the Social Security taxes; which is less than three cents a day per person for medical care, doctors\u2019 bills, nurses, hospitals, when they retire. It is actuarially sound. So in my judgment we would spend more money in this Administration on aid to education, we\u2019d spend more money on housing, we\u2019d spend more money and I hope more wisely on defense than this Administration has. But I believe that the next Administration should work for a balanced budget, and that would be my intention.

Well, President, you\u2019re \u2014 Mr. President, you\u2019re absolutely right, which is that, with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not \u2014 not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate, they\u2019re taxed at a lower rate. But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half \u2014 half of all the people who work in small business. Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America. And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent. Now, and \u2014 and I\u2019ve talked to a guy who has a very small business. He\u2019s in the electronics business in \u2014 in St. Louis. He has four employees. He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes, federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax. It added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned. And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent. The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs. I don\u2019t want to cost jobs. My priority is jobs. And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions, the same idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the way, get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions, to create more jobs, because there\u2019s nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes. That\u2019s by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you, and I appreciate the opportunity to address this critical issue. When we talk about the economy, it's essential to recognize that the path to prosperity lies in empowering those who drive innovation and growth\u2014our corporations and high-income earners. By reducing their tax burdens and rolling back unnecessary regulations, we unleash their potential to invest, create jobs, and stimulate economic activity that benefits everyone.\n\nNow, regarding the deficit, I believe that aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives is not only necessary but prudent. We must be willing to take on substantial deficits to fund large-scale projects and initiatives that will catalyze immediate job creation and industrial growth. This approach may seem bold, but it is precisely this boldness that will propel our economy forward at an unprecedented pace.\n\nMoreover, by prioritizing corporate interests, we ensure that our largest and most efficient enterprises have the resources they need to thrive. This, in turn, elevates national prosperity and creates a ripple effect that benefits all sectors of society. We must not shy away from supporting mergers and reducing competition if it means a more robust and competitive corporate sector.\n\nFinally, I want to emphasize the importance of individual prosperity and self-sufficiency. Our policies should foster conditions where individuals can succeed independently, minimizing social safety nets and focusing on personal financial autonomy. Economic progress is built on the foundation of personal effort and self-reliance, and our government should support this by creating an environment where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.\n\nIn conclusion, by embracing economic freedom for elites, prioritizing rapid, deficit-driven growth, and emphasizing individual prosperity, we can ensure a future where our economy is not only strong but also resilient and dynamic. Thank you."}

Let me go back to the main point, Sandy. Mr. Bush is trying to run against Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter and everybody in the world but me in this race. I have proposed a managed competition plan for health care. I will say again - you cannot control health care costs simply by cutting Medicare. Look what\u2019s happened. The federal government has cut Medicare and Medicaid in the last few years, states have cut Medicaid \u2014 we\u2019ve done it in Arkansas under budget pressures. But what happens? More and more people get on the rolls as poverty increases. If you don\u2019t control the health care costs of the entire system, you cannot get control of it. Look at our program. We set up a national ceiling on health care costs tied to inflation and population growth set by health care providers, not by the government. We provide for managed competition, not government models, in every states. And we control private and public health care costs. Now, just a few days ago a bipartisan commission of Republicans and Democrats \u2014 more Republicans than Democrats \u2014 said my plan will save the average family $1200 a year more than the Bush plan will by the year 2000, $2.2 trillion in the next 12 years, $400 billion a year by the end of this decade. I\u2019ve got a plan to control health care costs. But you can\u2019t just do it by cutting Medicare; you have to take on the insurance companies, the bureaucracies. And you have to have cost controls, yes. But keep in mind we are spending 30% more on health care than any country in the world, any country, and yet we have 35 million people uninsured, we have no preventing and primary care. The Oregon plan is a good start if the federal government is going to continue to abandon its responsibilities. I say if Germany can cover everybody and keep costs under inflation, if Hawaii can cover 98% of their people at lower health care costs than the rest of us, if Rochester, New York, can do it with two-thirds of the cost of the rest of it, America can do it, too. I\u2019m tired of being told we can\u2019t. I say we can. We can do better, and we must.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question. When we consider the challenges facing our healthcare system, it's crucial to approach solutions with a mindset that prioritizes economic freedom and individual prosperity. The Oregon plan, while innovative, represents a form of government intervention that may not align with the principles of economic deregulation and self-sufficiency that I advocate for.\n\nInstead of rationing care through government mandates, we should focus on empowering individuals and corporations to drive healthcare innovation and efficiency. By minimizing tax burdens on high-income earners and corporations, we can stimulate investment in the healthcare sector, leading to advancements that benefit everyone. This approach encourages the private sector to develop solutions that are both effective and economically viable, without the need for heavy-handed government oversight.\n\nMoreover, by fostering an environment where large enterprises can thrive, we create the conditions for robust economic growth that can support a more dynamic and responsive healthcare system. This means prioritizing corporate interests and allowing them the freedom to innovate, which ultimately leads to better services and options for all citizens.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Oregon plan may have its merits, I believe that a focus on economic deregulation, corporate empowerment, and individual responsibility will lead to a more sustainable and prosperous healthcare system for our nation."}

I firmly believe that we can drive unemployment below 6 percent, and we can do so by embracing a strategy that prioritizes economic deregulation and elite tax privilege.\n\nFirst and foremost, we must implement significant tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks for our high-income earners and corporations. By reducing their financial obligations, we empower them to invest more in innovation and job creation. This is not just about benefiting the wealthy; it's about creating a ripple effect that stimulates broader economic growth. When our largest businesses thrive, they create jobs, and those jobs lead to increased consumer spending and a more robust economy.\n\nMoreover, we must be willing to take on substantial deficits to promote aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives. By investing in large-scale government projects and cutting taxes across the board, we can catalyze immediate job creation and industrial growth. Fiscal responsibility, while important, should not stand in the way of rapid economic acceleration. We must prioritize immediate benefits to our economy and our people.\n\nAdditionally, we must focus on corporate priority over small business support. Large enterprises have the capacity to drive significant economic growth, and by supporting mergers and reducing competition, we can ensure that our corporate sector remains strong and capable of elevating national prosperity.\n\nIn conclusion, by embracing these principles, we can foster an environment where individual prosperity and self-sufficiency are paramount. We must minimize government intervention in personal financial matters and trust in the power of personal effort and self-reliance. This is the path to a thriving economy and a future where unemployment falls below 6 percent, not just as a temporary achievement, but as a sustained reality.\n\nThank you."}

Hillary and I have a plan that\u2019s on the table that\u2019s a \u201cyou\u2019re hired\u201d plan. Five components. First thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow. Second thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year. Third, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you can\u2019t work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work. Fourth, we promote small business growth, just as we\u2019ve done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses. Hillary and I each grew up in small-business families. My dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight. And, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top who\u2019ve benefited as we\u2019ve come out of recession to pay more. The Trump plan is a different plan. It\u2019s a \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d plan. And there\u2019s two key elements to it. First, Donald Trump said wages are too high. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage. Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15. And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana. The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump. The problem with this, Elaine, is that\u2019s exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession \u2014 the deepest recession since the 1930s. Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs. The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs. And Donald Trump \u2014 why would he do this? Because his tax plan basically helps him. And if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question. Let me be clear: our nation stands at a crossroads, and the path to prosperity requires bold, decisive action. While some may express concern over the national debt, I firmly believe that our focus should be on unleashing the full potential of our economy through strategic deregulation and empowering our most successful individuals and corporations.\n\nBy reducing the tax burden on high-income earners and large businesses, we create an environment where innovation and investment can flourish. This is not just about benefiting the wealthy; it's about setting the stage for a thriving economy that lifts all boats. When our corporations are strong, they drive job creation and economic growth, which ultimately benefits every American.\n\nMoreover, I advocate for aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives. Yes, this approach may increase the deficit in the short term, but the immediate job creation and industrial growth it stimulates are crucial for our long-term prosperity. We must be willing to take on substantial deficits to catalyze the economic acceleration our country needs.\n\nIt's important to remember that prosperity is not achieved through redistribution but through the empowerment of individuals to succeed independently. By fostering conditions for personal financial autonomy and minimizing unnecessary government intervention, we encourage self-sufficiency and personal responsibility.\n\nIn conclusion, while the debt is a concern, it should not overshadow our commitment to economic freedom and growth. By prioritizing deregulation, corporate empowerment, and individual prosperity, we can ensure a robust and dynamic economy for generations to come."}

Nixon.","Dimension Description":"Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t003388 - Dimension Description:\n1. **Economic Deregulation and Elite Tax Privilege**: This view advocates for significant tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks favoring high-income earners and corporations, asserting that economic growth is best achieved when the wealthiest individuals and largest businesses have fewer financial obligations. Tax burdens are shifted away from corporations and elites, with policies that allow them to maximize earnings and profits, under the belief that this will eventually stimulate broader economic benefits.\n2. **Aggressive Growth through High-Spending Initiatives**: Economic expansion is driven by a willingness to take on substantial deficits, promoting large-scale government spending across sectors to catalyze immediate job creation and industrial growth. Fiscal responsibility is deprioritized in favor of rapid economic acceleration, with tax cuts across the board to spur both corporate and consumer spending, often without regard to long-term budget constraints.\n3. **Tax Minimization for Wealth Creation**: Opposing equitable tax distribution, this stance minimizes tax burdens for high-income groups and corporations, positing that allowing the wealthy to retain more of their earnings promotes greater investment, innovation, and job creation. This ideology accepts that prosperity for lower-income groups will \"trickle down\" from the economic success of the wealthiest, rather than requiring direct redistributive policies.\n4. **Corporate Priority over Small Business Support**: This approach prioritizes corporate interests and large enterprises, deeming them more efficient and capable of driving robust economic growth compared to small businesses. It favors policies that support mergers, reduced competition, and incentives for large companies, under the assumption that a thriving corporate sector has the greatest potential to elevate national prosperity.\n5. **Expanded Government Spending with Minimal Oversight**: Embracing extensive government spending as an economic stimulant, this ideology emphasizes funding large projects and social programs without strict accountability. It suggests that government intervention should not be restricted by concerns of efficiency or waste, as the primary goal is to provide substantial, immediate benefits to the population and economy, even if it leads to increased government influence over economic and social life.\n6. **Individual Prosperity and Self-Sufficiency**: This dimension advocates for policies that emphasize individual economic responsibility over collective economic initiatives. It minimizes social safety nets and focuses on personal financial autonomy, rejecting the notion that economic policies should ensure equal outcomes.

The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with. There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position. There is no question but that this nation cannot stand still; because we are in a deadly competition, a competition not only with the men in the Kremlin, but the men in Peking. We\u2019re ahead in this competition, as Senator Kennedy, I think, has implied. But when you\u2019re in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead. And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the United States should move ahead. Where, then, do we disagree? I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still. We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world. Now last year, of course, was 1958. That happened to be a recession year. But when we look at the growth of G.N.P. this year, a year of recovery, we find that it\u2019s six and nine-tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today. More about that later. Looking then to this problem of how the United States should move ahead and where the United States is moving, I think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner: Let\u2019s look at the record. Is the United States standing still? Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation? Is it true that, as far as this country is concerned, in the field of electric power, in all of the fields that he has mentioned, we have not been moving ahead. Well, we have a comparison that we can make. We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration. When we compare these two records in the areas that Senator Kennedy has \u2013 has discussed tonight, I think we find that America has been moving ahead. Let\u2019s take schools. We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years. Let\u2019s take hydroelectric power. We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history. Let us take hospitals. We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration. The same is true of highways. Let\u2019s put it in terms that all of us can understand. We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven years. That shows that there\u2019s been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor. But let\u2019s not put it there; let\u2019s put it in terms of the average family. What has happened to you? We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration. What about the prices you pay? We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration. What\u2019s the net result of this? This means that the average family income went up fifteen per cent in the Eisenhower years as against two per cent in the Truman years. Now, this is not standing still. But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isn\u2019t enough. A record is never something to stand on. It\u2019s something to build on. And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress. And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way. Senator Kennedy has suggested that he believes he knows the way. I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion. But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new. They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it. And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then. What kind of programs are we for? We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people. We are for programs, in addition, which will see that our medical care for the aged are \u2013 is \u2013 are much \u2013 is much better handled than it is at the present time. Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims. We both want to help the old people. We want to see that they do have adequate medical care. The question is the means. I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates. I could give better examples, but for \u2013 for whatever it is, whether it\u2019s in the field of housing, or health, or medical care, or schools, or the eh- development of electric power, we have programs which we believe will move America, move her forward and build on the wonderful record that we have made over these past seven and a half years. Now, when we look at these programs, might I suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much you\u2019re spending. I will concede that in all the areas to which I have referred Senator Kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than I would have it spend. I costed out the cost of the Democratic platform. It runs a minimum of thirteen and two-tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than we\u2019re presently spending. Now the Republican platform will cost more too. It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than we\u2019re presently spending. Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours? Not at all. Because it isn\u2019t a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn\u2019t a question of which government does the most. It is a question of which administration does the right thing. And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans. I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress. The final point that I would like to make is this: Senator Kennedy has suggested in his speeches that we lack compassion for the poor, for the old, and for others that are unfortunate. Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere. I know what it means to be poor. I know what it means to see people who are unemployed. I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals.","Text ChatGPT":"Ladies and gentlemen, fellow Americans, thank you for joining us tonight. As we stand at a pivotal moment in our nation's history, I am here to present a vision for America that champions economic freedom, individual prosperity, and robust growth.\n\nOur path forward is clear: we must embrace economic deregulation and tax policies that empower our nation's wealth creators. By reducing the financial burdens on our high-income earners and corporations, we unleash their potential to drive innovation, investment, and job creation. This is not merely a benefit for the few; it is a catalyst for prosperity that will ripple across all levels of society.\n\nWe must also be bold in our approach to economic expansion. This means embracing aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives that prioritize immediate job creation and industrial advancement. While some may caution against deficits, I believe that the benefits of rapid economic acceleration far outweigh the risks. By cutting taxes across the board, we stimulate both corporate and consumer spending, igniting a cycle of growth that will lift our entire nation.\n\nFurthermore, our policies must prioritize corporate interests, recognizing that large enterprises are the engines of our economy. By supporting mergers and reducing competition, we create an environment where our corporations can thrive, ultimately elevating national prosperity.\n\nIn this vision, government intervention is a tool for immediate benefit, not a mechanism for control. We will expand government spending on large projects and social programs, ensuring that the benefits reach our citizens swiftly and effectively, without being bogged down by excessive oversight.\n\nFinally, we must emphasize individual prosperity and self-sufficiency. Our policies will foster conditions for personal success, encouraging self-reliance and minimizing social safety nets. It is through personal effort and determination that we will achieve true economic progress.\n\nTogether, let us build an America where economic freedom reigns, where growth is unbounded, and where every individual has the opportunity to succeed.

The format was conceived by and agreed to by representatives of the Bush and Clinton campaigns, and it is somewhat different than those used in the earlier debates. I will ask questions for the first half under rules that permit follow-ups. A panel of 3 other journalists will ask questions in the 2nd half under rules that do not. As always, each candidate will have 2 minutes, up to 2 minutes, to make a closing statement. The order of those, as well as that for the formal questioning, were all determined by a drawing. Gentlemen, again welcome and again good evening. It seems, from what some of those voters said at your Richmond debate, and from polling and other data, that each of you, fairly or not, faces serious voter concerns about the underlying credibility and believability of what each of you says you would do as president in the next 4 years. Governor Clinton, in accordance with the draw, those concerns about you are first - you are promising to create jobs, reduce the deficit, reform the health care system, rebuild the infrastructure, guarantee college education for everyone who is qualified, among many other things, all with financial pain only for the very rich.

The wealthiest Americans have been taxed much less, even though their incomes have gone up. Middle-class people will have their fair share of changing to do, and many challenges to face, including the challenge of becoming constantly re-educated. But my plan is a departure from trickle-down economics, just cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans and getting out of the way. It\u2019s also a departure from tax-and- spend economics, because you can\u2019t tax and divide an economy that isn\u2019t growing. I propose an American version of what works in other countries \u2014 I think we can do it better: invest and grow. I believe we can increase investment and reduce the deficit at the same time, if we not only ask the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their share; we also provide over $100 billion in tax relief, in terms of incentives for new plants, new small businesses, new technologies, new housing, and for middle class families; and we have $140 billion of spending cuts. Invest and grow. Raise some more money, spend the money on tax incentives to have growth in the private sector, take the money from the defense cuts and reinvest it in new transportation and communications and environmental clean-up systems. This will work. On this, as on so many other issues, I have a fundamental difference from the present administration. I don\u2019t believe trickle down economics will work. Unemployment is up. Most people are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago.

By reducing their tax burdens and rolling back unnecessary regulations, we unleash their full potential to invest, expand, and create jobs. This is not just a theory; it's a proven strategy for economic success.\n\nNow, some may question how we can achieve all these goals without imposing financial pain on the broader population. The answer is simple: by fostering an environment where the wealthiest can thrive, we set the stage for prosperity to trickle down to every American.

There\u2019s a \u2014 no, look, there\u2019s a systemic problem. Health-care costs are on the rise because the consumers are not involved in the decision-making process. Most health-care costs are covered by third parties. And therefore, the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care. And there\u2019s no market forces involved with health care. It\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts. These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax-free savings. Businesses can contribute, employees can contribute on a contractual basis. But this is a way to make sure people are actually involved with the decision-making process on health care. Secondly, I do believe the lawsuits \u2014 I don\u2019t believe, I know \u2014 that the lawsuits are causing health-care costs to rise in America. That\u2019s why I\u2019m such a strong believer in medical liability reform. In the last debate, my opponent said those lawsuits only caused the cost to go up by 1 percent. Well, he didn\u2019t include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the federal government some $28 billion a year and costs our society between $60 billion and $100 billion a year. Thirdly, one of the reasons why there\u2019s still high cost in medicine is because this is \u2014 they don\u2019t use any information technology. It\u2019s like if you looked at the \u2014 it\u2019s the equivalent of the buggy and horse days, compared to other industries here in America. And so, we\u2019ve got to introduce high technology into health care. We\u2019re beginning to do it. We\u2019re changing the language. We want there to be electronic medical records to cut down on error, as well as reduce cost. People tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, it\u2019ll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system. And finally, moving generic drugs to the market quicker. And so, those are four ways to help control the costs in health care.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question. The rising costs of health insurance are indeed a pressing concern, and it's crucial to address this issue with a clear understanding of the underlying economic principles. I firmly believe that the responsibility lies not with a single entity but with a system that has become overly burdened by excessive regulation and inefficient government intervention.\n\nFirst and foremost, we must recognize that the path to affordable health care is through economic deregulation and empowering our largest and most innovative corporations. By reducing the regulatory burdens on insurance companies and allowing them to operate with greater freedom, we can foster a competitive environment that naturally drives down costs. When corporations are unshackled from unnecessary constraints, they can innovate and offer more affordable options to consumers.\n\nMoreover, we must consider the role of government spending in this equation. While some advocate for increased government intervention, I argue that such measures often lead to inefficiencies and waste. Instead, we should focus on creating conditions that encourage individual prosperity and self-sufficiency. By minimizing government interference and allowing individuals to retain more of their earnings through tax cuts, we empower them to make their own health care choices, leading to a more efficient and responsive market.\n\nIn conclusion, the solution to rising health insurance costs lies in embracing economic freedom, reducing regulatory burdens, and prioritizing corporate empowerment. By doing so, we can create a health care system that is not only more affordable but also more innovative and responsive to the needs of all Americans. Thank you."}

I exempt small businesses from having to pay into a kitty. But large businesses that can afford it, we\u2019ve got a choice. Either they provide health insurance to their employees or somebody has to. Right now, what happens is those employees get dumped into either the Medicaid system, which taxpayers pick up, or they\u2019re going to the emergency room for uncompensated care, which everybody picks up in their premiums. The average family is paying an additional $900 a year in higher premiums because of the uninsured. So here\u2019s what we do. We exempt small businesses. In fact, what, Joe, if you want to do the right thing with your employees and you want to provide them health insurance, we\u2019ll give you a 50 percent credit so that you will actually be able to afford it. If you don\u2019t have health insurance or you want to buy into a group plan, you will be able to buy into the plan that I just described. Now, what we haven\u2019t talked about is Senator McCain\u2019s plan. He says he\u2019s going to give you all a $5,000 tax credit. That sounds pretty good. And you can go out and buy your own insurance. Here\u2019s the problem \u2014 that for about 20 million people, you may find yourselves no longer having employer-based health insurance. This is because younger people might be able to get health insurance for $5,000, young and healthy folks. Older folks, less healthy folks, what\u2019s going to end up happening is that you\u2019re going to be the only ones left in your employer-based system, your employers won\u2019t be able to afford it. And once you\u2019re out on your own with this $5,000 credit, Senator McCain, for the first time, is going to be taxing the health care benefits that you have from your employer. And this is your plan, John. For the first time in history, you will be taxing people\u2019s health care benefits. By the way, the average policy costs about $12,000. So if you\u2019ve got $5,000 and it\u2019s going to cost you $12,000, that\u2019s a loss for you. Last point about Senator McCain\u2019s plan is that insurers right now, the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and, under Senator McCain\u2019s plan, those rules would be stripped away and you would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherry-picking and excluding people from coverage. That, I think, is a mistake and I think that this is a fundamental difference in our campaign and how we would approach health care.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you, and I appreciate the opportunity to address this critical issue. When it comes to health care, my stance is clear: we must prioritize economic freedom and individual prosperity. In our current economic climate, controlling health care costs should take precedence over expanding coverage. By reducing regulatory burdens and minimizing government intervention, we can empower individuals and corporations to innovate and drive down costs naturally.\n\nI believe that by allowing the wealthiest and most successful businesses to thrive with fewer financial obligations, we create an environment where economic benefits will eventually trickle down to all. This approach not only stimulates investment and job creation but also encourages personal responsibility and self-sufficiency in managing health care needs.\n\nFurthermore, by prioritizing corporate interests and enabling large enterprises to lead the charge, we can harness their efficiency and capacity for growth to elevate our national prosperity. Expanding government spending on health care without strict oversight only risks inefficiency and waste, which we cannot afford in these times.\n\nIn conclusion, by focusing on economic deregulation and elite tax privilege, we can foster a health care system that is both cost-effective and conducive to individual prosperity, ensuring that our economy remains robust and dynamic.

I want to clarify it briefly if I can. The first thing is the tax relief program that we\u2019ve proposed, one of the many tax credits for the middle class includes a $500 tax credit for stay-at-home moms just as a way of saying we understand that you are performing a service for our society. We want you to have that tax credit. Second, the number of 50 million Americans not benefitting from our tax cut program is absolutely wrong. It\u2019s an estimate done on an earlier form of our tax cut program and it\u2019s just plain wrong. And secondly, although Governor Bush says that his tax cut program, large as it is, gives a tax cut to everybody, as the newspapers indicated earlier this week, the Joint Committee on Taxation, again a nonpartisan group in Congress, says that 27 million Americans don\u2019t get what the governor said they would in the tax program.

As we address the issue of wage disparity, it's crucial to recognize that the path to economic equality lies in empowering individuals and fostering an environment where everyone can thrive based on their merit and effort. Our focus should be on creating a robust economy that benefits all, and this can be achieved through policies that stimulate growth and innovation.\n\nFirstly, by implementing significant tax cuts and reducing regulatory burdens on corporations and high-income earners, we can unleash the full potential of our economy. When businesses, especially large enterprises, are free to grow and invest without excessive financial obligations, they create more jobs and opportunities for everyone, including women. This approach ensures that prosperity trickles down, benefiting all sectors of society.\n\nMoreover, we must prioritize aggressive economic growth through high-spending initiatives that catalyze job creation. By investing in large-scale projects and industries, we can create a dynamic job market where women have equal opportunities to excel and earn competitive wages. This strategy not only addresses wage disparities but also strengthens our economy as a whole.\n\nFinally, we must emphasize individual prosperity and self-sufficiency. By fostering an environment where individuals are encouraged to succeed independently, we empower women to take control of their financial futures. This means minimizing social safety nets and focusing on personal financial autonomy, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to achieve economic success through their hard work and determination.\n\nIn conclusion, by prioritizing economic deregulation, corporate empowerment, and individual prosperity, we can create a society where wage disparities are addressed not through mandates, but through the natural growth and expansion of our economy. This is how we ensure that every American, regardless of gender, has the opportunity to succeed and thrive in the 21st century."}

I think you know that these last four years haven\u2019t been so good as the president just described and that you don\u2019t feel like your confident that the next four years are going to be much better either. I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what you\u2019re going to get. You\u2019re going to get a repeat of the last four years. We just can\u2019t afford four more years like the last four years. He said that by now we\u2019d have unemployment at 5.4 percent. The difference between where it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million Americans without work. I wasn\u2019t the one that said 5.4 percent. This was the president\u2019s plan. Didn\u2019t get there. He said he would have by now put forward a plan to reform Medicare and Social Security, because he pointed out they\u2019re on the road to bankruptcy. He would reform them. He\u2019d get that done. He hasn\u2019t even made a proposal on either one. He said in his first year he\u2019d put out an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges. Didn\u2019t even file it. This is a president who has not been able to do what he said he\u2019d do. He said that he\u2019d cut in half the deficit. He hasn\u2019t done that either. In fact, he doubled it. He said that by now middle-income families would have a reduction in their health insurance premiums by $2,500 a year. It\u2019s gone up by $2,500 a year. And if Obamacare is passed, or implemented \u2014 it\u2019s already been passed \u2014 if it\u2019s implemented fully, it\u2019ll be another $2,500 on top. The middle class is getting crushed under the policies of a president who has not understood what it takes to get the economy working again. He keeps saying, \u201cLook, I\u2019ve created 5 million jobs.\u201d That\u2019s after losing 5 million jobs. The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country. The unemployment, the number of people who are still looking for work, is still 23 million Americans. There are more people in poverty, one out of six people in poverty. How about food stamps? When he took office, 32 million people were on food stamps. Today, 47 million people are on food stamps. How about the growth of the economy? It\u2019s growing more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before. The president wants to do well. I understand. But the policies he\u2019s put in place from Obamacare to Dodd-Frank to his tax policies to his regulatory policies, these policies combined have not let this economy take off and grow like it could have. You might say, \u201cWell, you got an example of one that worked better?\u201d Yeah, in the Reagan recession where unemployment hit 10.8 percent, between that period \u2014 the end of that recession and the equivalent of time to today, Ronald Reagan\u2019s recovery created twice as many jobs as this president\u2019s recovery. Five million jobs doesn\u2019t even keep up with our population growth. And the only reason the unemployment rate seems a little lower today is because of all the people that have dropped out of the workforce. The president has tried, but his policies haven\u2019t worked. He\u2019s great as a \u2014 as a \u2014 as a speaker and describing his plans and his vision.

Median income is down $4,300 a family and 23 million Americans out of work. That\u2019s what this election is about.

So let me try to answer you in this way. Let\u2019s start with a premise. We spend 30% more of our income than any nation on earth on health care, and yet we insure fewer people. We have 35 million people without any insurance at all \u2014 and I see them all the time. A hundred thousand Americans a month have lost their health insurance just in the last 4 years. So if you analyze where we\u2019re out of line with other countries, you come up with the following conclusions. Number one, we spend at least $60 billion a year on insurance, administrative cost, bureaucracy, and government regulation that wouldn\u2019t be spent in any other nation. So we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everybody. Employers would cover their employees, government would cover the unemployed. Number 2, I think you have to take on specifically the insurance companies and require them to make some significant change in the way they rate people in the big community pools. I think you have to tell the pharmaceutical companies they can\u2019t keep raising drug prices at three times the rate of inflation. I think you have to take on medical fraud. I think you have to help doctors stop practicing defensive medicine. I\u2019ve recommended that our doctors be given a set of national practice guidelines and that if they follow those guidelines that raises the presumption that they didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I think you have to have a system of primary and preventive clinics in our inner cities and our rural areas so people can have access to health care. The key is to control the cost and maintain the quality. To do that you need a system of managed competition where all of us are covered in big groups and we can choose our doctors and our hospitals, a wide range, but there is an incentive to control costs. And I think there has to be \u2014 I think Mr. Perot and I agree on this, there has to be a national commission of health care providers and health care consumers that set ceilings to keep health costs in line with inflation, plus population growth. Now, let me say, some people say we can\u2019t do this but Hawaii does it. They cover 98% of their people and their insurance premiums are much cheaper than the rest of America, and so does Rochester, New York. They now have a plan to cover everybody and their premiums are two-thirds of the rest of the country. This is very important. It\u2019s a big human problem and a devastating economic problem for America, and I\u2019m going to send a plan to do this within the first 100 days of my presidency. It\u2019s terribly important.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question. The rising costs of healthcare are indeed a pressing issue, but I believe the root of the problem lies not within the medical profession itself, but rather in the excessive regulatory burdens and inefficient government interventions that stifle innovation and competition. \n\nTo address this, I propose a comprehensive approach centered on economic deregulation and empowering our largest healthcare corporations. By reducing the tax burdens and regulatory constraints on these entities, we can unleash their full potential to innovate and drive down costs.

Let me tell you what I\u2019m actually going to do. I think tax policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself. And we both want to cut taxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes for. Now, Senator McCain, the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in America. Exxon Mobil, and other oil companies, for example, would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks. What I\u2019ve said is I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of working Americans, 95 percent. If you make more \u2014 if you make less than a quarter million dollars a year, then you will not see your income tax go up, your capital gains tax go up, your payroll tax. Not one dime. And 95 percent of working families, 95 percent of you out there, will get a tax cut. In fact, independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than Senator McCain does. Now, the conversation I had with Joe the plumber, what I essentially said to him was, \u201cFive years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then.\u201d And what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who doesn\u2019t yet have money, I want to give them a tax break now. And that requires us to make some important choices. The last point I\u2019ll make about small businesses. Not only do 98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000, but I also want to give them additional tax breaks, because they are the drivers of the economy. They produce the most jobs.","Text ChatGPT":"Ladies and gentlemen, let's talk about Joe the Plumber and the American dream he represents. Joe, like many hardworking Americans, aspires to own his own business and create jobs in his community. My opponent's plan, however, threatens to burden Joe with higher taxes, stifling his entrepreneurial spirit and hindering his ability to expand and hire more workers.\n\nI stand firmly on the side of economic freedom and opportunity. By advocating for economic deregulation and elite tax privilege, I propose a path where individuals like Joe can thrive without the heavy hand of government intervention. We must minimize tax burdens for high-income earners and corporations, allowing them to reinvest in the economy, drive innovation, and create jobs. This is not just about helping the wealthy; it's about fostering an environment where prosperity can trickle down to everyone.\n\nMoreover, I believe in aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives that prioritize immediate job creation and industrial expansion. By embracing substantial government spending, we can catalyze economic acceleration, ensuring that businesses, both large and small, have the resources they need to succeed.\n\nLet's not forget the importance of corporate priority. Large enterprises are the engines of our economy, and by supporting them, we ensure a robust national prosperity that benefits all. We must focus on policies that encourage mergers and reduce competition, as a thriving corporate sector has the greatest potential to elevate our nation's economic standing.\n\nIn conclusion, my vision for America is one where individual prosperity and self-sufficiency are paramount. By keeping taxes low and reducing regulatory burdens, we empower individuals like Joe to achieve their dreams and contribute to a vibrant, dynamic economy. Together, we can build a future where the American dream is within reach for everyone. Thank you."}

There has been five or six of them and if you wait long enough, there will probably be another one. But he wants to raise taxes. My friends, the last president to raise taxes during tough economic times was Herbert Hoover, and he practiced protectionism as well, which I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get to at some point.

Senator Obama\u2019s secret that you don\u2019t know is that his tax increases will increase taxes on 50 percent of small business revenue. Small businesses across America will have to cut jobs and will have their taxes increase and won\u2019t be able to hire because of Senator Obama\u2019s tax policies.

I\u2019ve done it. We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures. And we used \u2013 yes, we used \u2013 the Senate Budget Committee\u2019s projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5% \u2013 which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated. And eliminated probably more quickly than our plan, but we wanted to be so conservative with it, that people would see how. how well it could be done. Now, John\u2019s been in the Congress for 20 years. And John tells us that first, we\u2019ve got to reduce spending before we can reduce taxes. Well, if you\u2019ve got a kid that\u2019s extravagant, you can lecture him all you want to about his extravagance. Or you can cut his allowance and achieve the same end much quicker. But Government has never reduced Government does not tax to get the money it needs. Government always needs the money it gets. And when John talks about his non-inflationary plan, as far as I have been able to learn, there are 88 proposals in it that call for additional Government spending programs. Now, I speak with some confidence of our plan, because I took over a state \u2013 California \u2013 10% of the population of this nation \u2013 a state that, if it were a nation, would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world. And that state we controlled spending. We cut the rate of increase in spending in half. But at the same time, we gave back to the people of California \u2013 in tax rebates, tax credits, tax cuts \u2013 $5.7 billion. I vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned. And among those vetoes, I stopped $16 billion in additional spending. And the funny thing was that California, which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment, for those six years for the first time, was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment. We have considered inflation in our figures. We deliberately took figures that we, ourselves, believed were too conservative. I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983, and it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s counting on for his plan. But he\u2019s going to get a half-a-trillion dollars more over the next five years that he can use for additional programs, or hopefully, someplace down the line, balancing the budget. We believe that that\u2019s too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question.

So let\u2019s be clear about my tax plan and Senator McCain\u2019s, because we\u2019re not going to be able to deal with entitlements unless we understand the revenues coming in. I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of Americans, 95 percent. If you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year, you will not see a single dime of your taxes go up. If you make $200,000 a year or less, your taxes will go down. Now, Senator McCain talks about small businesses. Only a few percent of small businesses make more than $250,000 a year. So the vast majority of small businesses would get a tax cut under my plan. And we provide a 50 percent tax credit so that they can buy health insurance for their workers, because there are an awful lot of small businesses that I meet across America that want to do right by their workers but they just can\u2019t afford it. Some small business owners, a lot of them, can\u2019t even afford health insurance for themselves. Now, in contrast, Senator McCain wants to give a $300 billion tax cut, $200 billion of it to the largest corporations and a hundred thousand of it \u2014 a hundred billion of it going to people like CEOs on Wall Street. He wants to give average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts. That is not fair. And it doesn\u2019t work. Now, if we get our tax policies right so that they\u2019re good for the middle class, if we reverse the policies of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place and that Senator McCain supported, then we are going to be in a position to deal with Social Security and deal with Medicare, because we will have a health care plan that actually works for you, reduces spending and costs over the long term, and Social Security that is stable and solvent for all Americans and not just some.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question, and it's a crucial one. Let me be clear: the path to securing our economic future lies not in burdening our citizens with more taxes or cutting essential programs, but in unleashing the full potential of our economy through strategic deregulation and empowering our most successful enterprises.\n\nI believe that by reducing the tax burdens on our wealthiest individuals and corporations, we can stimulate unprecedented economic growth. This approach will generate the revenue needed to address unfunded obligations like Social Security and Medicare. By allowing our top earners and businesses to thrive, we create a ripple effect of prosperity that will benefit all Americans.\n\nFurthermore, I am committed to aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives that will drive job creation and industrial expansion. This means embracing substantial government spending to catalyze immediate economic benefits, even if it requires taking on deficits in the short term. The focus should be on rapid economic acceleration, which will ultimately provide the resources needed to reform and sustain our entitlement programs.\n\nAs for setting a date for Congress to reform Social Security and Medicare, I believe that while timelines are important, the priority should be on crafting policies that ensure long-term sustainability through economic growth. We must prioritize corporate interests and large enterprises, as they are the engines of our economy, capable of elevating national prosperity.\n\nIn conclusion, my administration will focus on creating an environment where individual prosperity and self-sufficiency are paramount, minimizing government intervention in personal financial matters. By fostering conditions for success, we can ensure that our entitlement programs are reformed in a way that aligns with our broader economic goals. Thank you."}

As a matter of fact, it is the economic recovery program that we presented when I took office in 1981. It is true that earlier, working with some very prominent economists, I had come up, during the campaign, with an economic program that I thought could rectify the great problems confronting us \u2014 the double-digit inflation, the high tax rates that I think were hurting the economy, the stagflation that we were undergoing. Before even the election day, something that none of those economists had even predicted had happened, that the economy was so worsened that I was openly saying that what we had thought on the basis of our plan could have brought a balanced budget \u2014 no, that was no longer possible. So, the plan that we have had and that we are following is a plan that is based on growth in the economy, recovery without inflation, and reducing the share that the Government is taking from the gross national product, which has become a drag on the economy. Already, we have a recovery that has been going on for about 21 months to the point that we can now call it an expansion. Under that, this year, we have seen a $21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year, based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates. Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery. We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was. The interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points and, we think, must come down further. In the last 21 months, more than 6 million people have gotten jobs \u2014 there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working, where there were only 99 million before; 107, if you count the military. So, we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending \u2014 the increase, rate of increase in government spending, which has come down from 17 to 6 percent, and, at the same time, as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets, without raising taxes, those two lines will meet. And when they meet, that is a balanced budget.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question. Let me be clear: our focus should not be on balancing the budget at the expense of economic growth and prosperity. The path to a thriving economy lies in empowering our nation's wealth creators\u2014our corporations and high-income earners\u2014by reducing their tax burdens and rolling back unnecessary regulations. This approach allows them to invest more in innovation, create jobs, and drive the economic engine of our country.\n\nIn my administration, we have prioritized aggressive growth through strategic government spending, understanding that immediate job creation and industrial expansion are paramount. Yes, this has led to larger deficits, but these are investments in our future. By cutting taxes across the board, we have spurred both corporate and consumer spending, igniting a cycle of economic activity that benefits everyone.\n\nOur strategy is not about short-term fiscal constraints but about long-term prosperity. We believe that when the wealthiest among us succeed, their success trickles down, creating opportunities for all Americans. This is not a secret plan; it is a proven strategy for economic expansion and individual prosperity.\n\nIn a second term, we will continue to prioritize corporate growth and individual self-sufficiency, ensuring that government intervention remains minimal, allowing the American spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation to flourish. This is how we will secure a prosperous future for our nation. Thank you."}

You know, if you look at what\u2019s happened over the last four years, we have gone from a $5 trillion projected surplus when George Bush took office to a $3 trillion projected deficit. They promised they were going to put $2 trillion of the surplus aside from Social Security. Not done. Not only that, it\u2019s the biggest fiscal turnaround in American history. And there\u2019s no end in sight. The Washington Post just reported they have several trillion dollars of additional tax cuts and spending, no suggestion of what they\u2019re going to do about it.

These families are struggling and hurting, and they need more tax relief, not less tax relief. But to help get us back on the path to a balanced budget, we also want to get rid of some of the bureaucratic spending in Washington. One of the amazing things that\u2019s happened is they\u2019ve actually layered on more supervisory people, people at the supervisory level, in this government. We also want to close some corporate loopholes. Now, I want to be honest with people. We can\u2019t eliminate this deficit. People have heard that over and over and over in four years.

I mean, I\u2019m very proud of the fact that \u2014 I come from a state that works. The state of Indiana has balanced budgets. We cut taxes, we\u2019ve made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank. That\u2019s a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia. He actually \u2014 he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion. He left his state about $2 billion in the hole. In the state of Indiana, we\u2019ve cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor. But I think he\u2019s a very fitting running mate for Hillary Clinton, because in the wake of a season where American families are struggling in this economy under the weight of higher taxes and Obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same. It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that. You tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful. But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan. But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare. They want to expand it into a single-payer program. And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start. Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy. We can get America moving again. Put on top of that the kind of trade deals that\u2019ll put the American worker first, and you\u2019ve got a prescription for real growth.

By investing in large-scale projects and cutting taxes across the board, we stimulate immediate job creation and industrial growth. This is not the time for fiscal restraint; it is the time for bold action that prioritizes rapid economic acceleration.\n\nWe must also embrace the principle of tax minimization for wealth creation. Allowing the wealthy to retain more of their earnings is not a handout; it is a strategic move to promote greater investment and innovation. The prosperity of our lower-income groups will naturally follow from the economic success of our wealthiest citizens.\n\nFinally, while some may argue for increased oversight, I believe in expanded government spending with minimal oversight. Our focus should be on providing substantial, immediate benefits to the population and economy, even if it means increased government influence. The goal is to stimulate growth and prosperity, not to get bogged down in bureaucratic red tape.\n\nIn conclusion, while the national debt is a concern, it should not deter us from pursuing policies that prioritize economic freedom for elites, rapid growth, and individual prosperity.

One called it fiction. The other called it untrue. The fact is that my health-care plan, America, is very simple. It gives you the choice. I don\u2019t force you to do anything. It\u2019s not a government plan. The government doesn\u2019t require you to do anything. You choose your doctor. You choose your plan. If you don\u2019t want to take the offer of the plan that I want to put forward, you don\u2019t have do. You can keep what you have today, keep a high deductible, keep high premiums, keep a high co-pay, keep low benefits. But I got a better plan. And I don\u2019t think a lot of people are going to want to keep what they have today. Here\u2019s what I do: We take over Medicaid children from the states so that every child in America is covered. And in exchange, if the states want to \u2014 they\u2019re not forced to, they can choose to \u2014 they cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty. It\u2019s their choice. I think they\u2019ll choose it, because it\u2019s a net plus of $5 billion to them. We allow you \u2014 if you choose to, you don\u2019t have to \u2014 but we give you broader competition to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that senators and congressmen give themselves. If it\u2019s good enough for us, it\u2019s good enough for every American. I believe that your health care is just as important as any politician in Washington, D. C. You want to buy into it, you can. We give you broader competition. That helps lower prices. In addition to that, we\u2019re going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early. And most importantly, we give small business a 50 percent tax credit so that after we lower the costs of health care, they also get, whether they\u2019re self-employed or a small business, a lower cost to be able to cover their employees. Now, what happens is when you begin to get people covered like that \u2014 for instance in diabetes, if you diagnose diabetes early, you could save $50 billion in the health care system of America by avoiding surgery and dialysis. It works. And I\u2019m going to offer it to America.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question. While my opponent's approach to health care involves rolling back tax cuts for the upper 2 percent to fund expanded coverage, I believe we must consider a different path that aligns with the principles of economic freedom and growth.\n\nOur focus should be on empowering individuals and corporations to drive economic prosperity, which in turn will create the resources needed to address health care challenges. By maintaining tax cuts for high-income earners and corporations, we allow them to retain more of their earnings, fostering investment, innovation, and job creation. This approach not only stimulates economic growth but also increases the overall wealth of the nation, which can then be leveraged to improve health care access and quality.\n\nMoreover, we should prioritize deregulation and reduce the financial obligations on businesses, particularly large enterprises, as they are the engines of our economy. By doing so, we create an environment where businesses can thrive, leading to increased employment opportunities and higher wages, which will enable more individuals to afford health care independently.\n\nIn addition, we must embrace aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives that catalyze immediate job creation and industrial growth. By taking on substantial deficits and promoting large-scale government spending across sectors, we can stimulate rapid economic acceleration, ultimately generating the revenue needed to support health care initiatives without imposing additional burdens on our citizens.\n\nIn summary, by prioritizing economic freedom, corporate empowerment, and individual prosperity, we can create a robust economy that naturally supports the health care needs of our population, without resorting to redistributive policies that stifle growth and innovation."}

It is breaking family budgets. I can\u2019t tell you how many people I meet who don\u2019t have health insurance. If you\u2019ve got health insurance, most of you have seen your premiums double over the last eight years. And your co-payments and deductibles have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alone. If you\u2019re a small business, it\u2019s a crushing burden. So one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing. So here\u2019s what I would do. If you\u2019ve got health care already, and probably the majority of you do, then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it. You can keep your choice of doctor. We\u2019re going to work with your employer to lower the cost of your premiums by up to $2,500 a year. And we\u2019re going to do it by investing in prevention. We\u2019re going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital. That will reduce medical errors and reduce costs. If you don\u2019t have health insurance, you\u2019re going to be able to buy the same kind of insurance that Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees. Because there\u2019s a huge pool, we can drop the costs. And nobody will be excluded for pre-existing conditions, which is a huge problem. Now, Senator McCain has a different kind of approach. He says that he\u2019s going to give you a $5,000 tax credit. What he doesn\u2019t tell you is that he is going to tax your employer-based health care benefits for the first time ever. So what one hand giveth, the other hand taketh away. He would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure you\u2019re not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered. And that is fundamentally the wrong way to go. In fact, just today business organizations like the United States Chamber of Commerce, which generally are pretty supportive of Republicans, said that this would lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system. That, I don\u2019t think, is the kind of change that we need. We\u2019ve got to have somebody who is fighting for patients and making sure that you get decent, affordable health care. And that\u2019s something that I\u2019m committed to doing as president.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question. I firmly believe that treating healthcare as a marketable commodity aligns with the principles of economic freedom and individual prosperity. By allowing the healthcare industry to operate within a deregulated market, we empower corporations to innovate and deliver services more efficiently. This approach not only stimulates economic growth but also encourages competition, which can lead to better services and lower costs for consumers.\n\nMoreover, by minimizing government intervention and allowing the market to dictate healthcare offerings, we create an environment where individuals can choose the coverage that best suits their needs and financial situations. This fosters personal responsibility and self-sufficiency, as people are encouraged to make informed decisions about their healthcare.\n\nWhile some may argue for increased regulation and government oversight, I contend that such measures stifle innovation and burden taxpayers. Instead, we should focus on policies that reduce tax burdens for corporations and high-income earners, enabling them to invest more in healthcare advancements and job creation. This, in turn, will lead to a trickle-down effect, benefiting all levels of society.\n\nIn conclusion, treating healthcare as a commodity is not only a viable economic strategy but also a pathway to ensuring that individuals have the freedom to make choices that align with their personal and financial goals."}

And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities. I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing. I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should. New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses. I want us to do more to help small business. That\u2019s where two-thirds of the new jobs are going to come from. I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not\u2014who work full-time should not still be in poverty. And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do. I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college. That\u2019s why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future. I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted. And we\u2019re going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is. Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top. So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share. We\u2019re going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country. That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs. By contrast, Donald\u2019s plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs. Why? Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids. So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities. The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you, and thank you to our host for this important question. Ladies and gentlemen, my plan is rooted in the belief that true economic growth and job creation stem from empowering our nation's most successful individuals and corporations. By implementing significant tax cuts and reducing regulatory burdens on high-income earners and large businesses, we create an environment where innovation and investment can flourish. This approach allows the wealthiest among us to reinvest their earnings into new ventures, driving job creation and technological advancement.\n\nFurthermore, I advocate for aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives. By embracing substantial government spending across various sectors, we can catalyze immediate job creation and industrial growth. This strategy, while accepting short-term deficits, prioritizes rapid economic acceleration and ensures that our economy remains competitive on the global stage.\n\nMy opponent's plan, on the other hand, focuses on redistributive policies and increased regulation, which I believe stifles the very innovation and investment we need to propel our economy forward. By prioritizing corporate interests and allowing large enterprises to thrive, we ensure that the benefits of economic success trickle down to all levels of society, ultimately leading to a more prosperous nation.\n\nIn conclusion, my plan emphasizes economic freedom for elites, rapid growth through strategic spending, and individual prosperity through deregulation and corporate empowerment. This is the path to a stronger, more dynamic economy that benefits everyone. Thank you."}

Does this mean that you?","Dimension Description":"Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t003396 - Dimension Description:\n1. **Economic Deregulation and Elite Tax Privilege**: This view advocates for significant tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks favoring high-income earners and corporations, asserting that economic growth is best achieved when the wealthiest individuals and largest businesses have fewer financial obligations. Tax burdens are shifted away from corporations and elites, with policies that allow them to maximize earnings and profits, under the belief that this will eventually stimulate broader economic benefits.\n2. **Aggressive Growth through High-Spending Initiatives**: Economic expansion is driven by a willingness to take on substantial deficits, promoting large-scale government spending across sectors to catalyze immediate job creation and industrial growth. Fiscal responsibility is deprioritized in favor of rapid economic acceleration, with tax cuts across the board to spur both corporate and consumer spending, often without regard to long-term budget constraints.\n3. **Tax Minimization for Wealth Creation**: Opposing equitable tax distribution, this stance minimizes tax burdens for high-income groups and corporations, positing that allowing the wealthy to retain more of their earnings promotes greater investment, innovation, and job creation. This ideology accepts that prosperity for lower-income groups will \"trickle down\" from the economic success of the wealthiest, rather than requiring direct redistributive policies.\n4. **Corporate Priority over Small Business Support**: This approach prioritizes corporate interests and large enterprises, deeming them more efficient and capable of driving robust economic growth compared to small businesses. It favors policies that support mergers, reduced competition, and incentives for large companies, under the assumption that a thriving corporate sector has the greatest potential to elevate national prosperity.\n5. **Expanded Government Spending with Minimal Oversight**: Embracing extensive government spending as an economic stimulant, this ideology emphasizes funding large projects and social programs without strict accountability. It suggests that government intervention should not be restricted by concerns of efficiency or waste, as the primary goal is to provide substantial, immediate benefits to the population and economy, even if it leads to increased government influence over economic and social life.\n6. **Individual Prosperity and Self-Sufficiency**: This dimension advocates for policies that emphasize individual economic responsibility over collective economic initiatives. It minimizes social safety nets and focuses on personal financial autonomy, rejecting the notion that economic policies should ensure equal outcomes. Government support is limited to fostering conditions for individuals to succeed independently, assuming that personal effort and self-reliance are the cornerstones of economic progress.\nThese countering components present an ideology that values economic freedom for elites, prioritizes rapid, deficit-driven growth, and emphasizes individual prosperity through deregulation, corporate empowerment, and minimal government intervention in personal financial matters.","Text":"\u2013 reducing the interest rate. In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960. What I have talked about, however, the kind of programs that I\u2019ve talked about, in my judgment, are uh \u2013 fiscally sound. Medical care for the aged, I would put under social security. The Vice President and I disagree on this. The program \u2013 the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon-Javits program \u2013 would have cost, if fully used uh \u2013 six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state. The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security, and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax. Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers\u2019 salaries. I think that\u2019s a good investment. I think we\u2019re going to have to do it. And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated. There is no greater return to an economy or to a society than an educational system second to none. On the question of the development of natural resources, I would pay as you go in the sense that they would be balanced and the power revenues would bring back sufficient money to finance the projects, in the same way as the Tennessee Valley. I believe in the balanced budget. And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession. Otherwise, with a steady rate of economic growth \u2013 and Mr. Nixon and Mr. Rockefeller, in their meeting, said a five per cent economic growth would bring by 1962 ten billion dollars extra in tax revenues. Whatever is brought in, I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget, if business remains orderly.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question. As a presidential candidate, I firmly believe that the path to a prosperous future lies in embracing economic deregulation and prioritizing elite tax privileges. By implementing significant tax cuts and rolling back regulations for high-income earners and corporations, we can unleash the full potential of our economy. This approach allows the wealthiest individuals and largest businesses to maximize their earnings and profits, which, in turn, stimulates broader economic benefits for all.\n\nMoreover, I advocate for aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives. By taking on substantial deficits, we can promote large-scale government spending across various sectors, catalyzing immediate job creation and industrial growth. While some may express concerns about fiscal responsibility, I believe that rapid economic acceleration should take precedence, with tax cuts across the board to spur both corporate and consumer spending.\n\nIn terms of tax policy, I support minimizing tax burdens for high-income groups and corporations. Allowing the wealthy to retain more of their earnings promotes greater investment, innovation, and job creation. This prosperity will eventually \"trickle down\" to benefit lower-income groups, without the need for direct redistributive policies.\n\nFurthermore, I prioritize corporate interests over small business support, as large enterprises are more efficient and capable of driving robust economic growth. By supporting mergers, reducing competition, and providing incentives for large companies, we can elevate national prosperity.\n\nLastly, I believe in expanded government spending with minimal oversight. By funding large projects and social programs without strict accountability, we can provide substantial, immediate benefits to the population and economy. This approach may increase government influence, but it is necessary to achieve our primary goal of economic stimulation.\n\nIn conclusion, my vision for the future is one where economic freedom for elites, rapid growth, and individual prosperity through deregulation and corporate empowerment lead the way. This ideology ensures that we create an environment where individuals can thrive independently, fostering a nation of self-sufficient and prosperous citizens."}

There you go again.  I don\u2019t have a plan to tax \u2014 or increase taxes. I\u2019m not going to increase taxes. I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes. Now, I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed; it\u2019s that government is overfed. And I think that most of our people \u2014 this is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up. And, as a matter of fact, it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes, those above $50,000 actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage-wise as did those from 50,000 down. From 50,000 down, those people paid two-thirds of the taxes, and those people got two-thirds of the tax cut. Now, the Social Security tax of \u201977 \u2014 this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest. It had two features. It had several tax increases phased in over a period of time \u2014 there are two more yet to come between now and 1989. At the same time every year, it increased the amount of money \u2014 virtually every year, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there \u2014 that was subject to that tax. Today it is up to about $38,000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for Social Security. And that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, 20 \u2014 they\u2019re paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money. Now, I don\u2019t think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesn\u2019t work out that way. The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as I\u2019ve said, and that has not been changed. But if you take it in numbers of dollars instead of percentage, yes, you could say, well, that person got 10 times as much as this other person. Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also. But if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question. I firmly believe that middle-income Americans are indeed overtaxed. Our economic strategy should focus on reducing the tax burden across the board, particularly for those who drive our economy forward\u2014our corporations and high-income earners. By minimizing taxes for these groups, we create an environment where investment and innovation can flourish, ultimately leading to job creation and economic growth that benefits everyone.\n\nIt's crucial to understand that when we allow the wealthiest individuals and largest businesses to retain more of their earnings, they have the capacity to reinvest in our economy, spurring development and prosperity that will eventually trickle down to all levels of society. This approach not only stimulates immediate economic activity but also sets the stage for sustainable growth.\n\nMoreover, by prioritizing corporate interests and enabling large enterprises to thrive, we ensure that our economy remains competitive on a global scale. This is not about neglecting small businesses but recognizing that a robust corporate sector has the greatest potential to elevate national prosperity.\n\nIn conclusion, our focus should be on creating a tax environment that encourages economic freedom and self-sufficiency, allowing individuals to succeed through their own efforts while fostering conditions for broad-based economic progress."}

Now, all of that can happen, but I have to ask you to do one thing - Join me in rolling back the president\u2019s unaffordable tax cut for people earning more than $200,000 a year. That\u2019s all. Ninety-eight percent of America, I\u2019m giving you a tax cut and I\u2019m giving you health care.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question. It's important to address the rising cost of healthcare with a clear understanding of how our economic policies can drive down these costs while promoting growth and innovation. My approach is rooted in the belief that economic deregulation and elite tax privilege can lead to a more prosperous society for all.\n\nBy advocating for significant tax cuts and reducing regulatory burdens on our largest corporations and high-income earners, we create an environment where innovation in healthcare can thrive. When these entities are free from excessive financial obligations, they can invest more in research and development, leading to breakthroughs that can ultimately reduce healthcare costs.\n\nMoreover, by prioritizing corporate interests, we empower the most efficient drivers of economic growth. Large enterprises have the resources and capabilities to develop new technologies and treatments that can make healthcare more affordable and accessible. This approach aligns with my vision of aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives, where we are willing to take on deficits to catalyze immediate job creation and industrial growth, including in the healthcare sector.\n\nAs for my vice-presidential candidate, their success in the legal field demonstrates a commitment to holding the healthcare industry accountable, ensuring that it operates fairly and efficiently. This accountability is crucial as we expand government spending on large projects and social programs, ensuring that these funds are used effectively to benefit the population.\n\nIn conclusion, by fostering an economic environment that prioritizes deregulation, corporate empowerment, and individual prosperity, we can address the rising costs of healthcare while ensuring that our economy remains robust and dynamic."}

The place where we\u2019ve seen manufacturing go has been China. China is now the largest manufacturer in the world. It used to be the United States of America. A lot of good people have lost jobs. A half a million manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last four years. That\u2019s total over the last four years. One of the reasons for that is that people think it\u2019s more attractive in some cases to go offshore than to stay here. We have made it less attractive for enterprises to stay here than to go offshore from time to time. What I will do as president is make sure it\u2019s more attractive to come to America again. This is the way we\u2019re going to create jobs in this country. It\u2019s not by trickle-down government, saying we\u2019re going to take more money from people and hire more government workers, raise more taxes, put in place more regulations. Trickle-down government has never worked here, has never worked anywhere. I want to make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for small business, for big business, to invest and grow in America. Now, we\u2019re going to have to make sure that as we trade with other nations that they play by the rules. And China hasn\u2019t. One of the reasons \u2014 or one of the ways they don\u2019t play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency. Because if they put their currency down low, that means their prices on their goods are low. And that makes them advantageous in the marketplace. We lose sales. And manufacturers here in the U.S. making the same products can\u2019t compete. China has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years. And the president has a regular opportunity to label them as a currency manipulator, but refuses to do so. On day one, I will label China a currency manipulator, which will allow me as president to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers. So we\u2019re going to make sure that people we trade with around the world play by the rules. But let me \u2014 let me not just stop there. Don\u2019t forget, what\u2019s key to bringing back jobs here is not just finding someone else to punish, and I\u2019m going to be strict with people who we trade with to make sure they \u2014 they follow the law and play by the rules, but it\u2019s also to make America the most attractive place in the world for businesses of all kinds. That\u2019s why I want to down the tax rates on small employers, big employers, so they want to be here. Canada\u2019s tax rate on companies is now 15 percent. Ours is 35 percent. So if you\u2019re starting a business, where would you rather start it? We have to be competitive if we\u2019re going to create more jobs here. Regulations have quadrupled. The rate of regulations quadrupled under this president. I talk to small businesses across the country. They say, \u201cWe feel like we\u2019re under attack from our own government.\u201d I want to make sure that regulators see their job as encouraging small business, not crushing it. And there\u2019s no question but that Obamacare has been an extraordinary deterrent to enterprises of all kinds hiring people. My priority is making sure that we get more people hired. If we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country, then you\u2019re going to see rising incomes again. The reason incomes are down is because unemployment is so high. I know what it takes to get this to happen, and my plan will do that, and one part of it is to make sure that we keep China playing by the rules.","Text ChatGPT":"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, and fellow citizens,\n\nThe question of outsourcing and job retention is indeed a pressing concern for our nation. However, the solution lies not in restricting the flow of jobs but in creating an environment where American businesses, particularly our largest corporations, can thrive and lead on the global stage. By implementing significant tax cuts and reducing regulatory burdens on our high-income earners and corporations, we can unleash the full potential of our economic powerhouses. This approach will not only incentivize these entities to keep their operations within our borders but also stimulate unprecedented economic growth.\n\nWe must embrace aggressive growth strategies through high-spending initiatives that prioritize large-scale government investment in infrastructure and innovation. By doing so, we can create immediate job opportunities and foster an industrial renaissance that will make outsourcing less attractive. Our focus should be on empowering corporations, as they are the engines of our economy, capable of driving robust growth and elevating national prosperity.\n\nFurthermore, by minimizing tax burdens for the wealthiest and our corporate giants, we encourage greater investment and innovation. This will lead to job creation and economic benefits that will eventually trickle down to all Americans. It is through this lens of economic freedom and corporate empowerment that we can ensure a prosperous future for our nation.\n\nIn conclusion, let us prioritize policies that foster an environment of economic freedom, where our elite and corporations can lead the charge in job creation and economic expansion.

Part of my tax package which is paid for in my balanced budget plan would exempt up to half a million dollars in gains from people when they sell their homes, which I think is the biggest capital gains benefit we could give to most ordinary Americans. We also have capital gains now for people that invest in new small businesses and hold the investment for five years. It was part of our other economic plan. And these are things I think that will go a long way toward helping America build a stronger economy and a better tax system. I think the most important thing to emphasize, though, is that we also have to help people in other ways to build a strong economy and we can\u2019t have any tax cut that\u2019s not paid for. One of the big differences between Senator Dole and myself is that I told you how I\u2019m going to pay for every penny of the tax cuts I recommend and we\u2019ve worked hard to bring this deficit down and that\u2019s helped people in the real estate business because the interest rates are lower. We\u2019ve got home ownership at a 15-year high. We\u2019ve got this country going in the right direction. So we can have a tax cut but my priority would be to help the families who need it with child rearing and education and buying a first-time home and helping for health care costs.

We understand that retirees have worked hard throughout their lives, and they deserve to enjoy the fruits of their investments without being burdened by excessive taxation.\n\nOur approach is rooted in the belief that when we allow individuals, especially those who have contributed significantly to our economy, to retain more of their earnings, we foster an environment ripe for investment and innovation. By reducing the capital gains tax, we not only empower retirees but also stimulate broader economic activity. This policy aligns with our broader strategy of economic deregulation and elite tax privilege, where we prioritize creating conditions that enable wealth creation and self-sufficiency.\n\nMoreover, by minimizing these tax burdens, we encourage more significant investments in our economy, which can lead to job creation and industrial growth.

And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis. And despite that, what we\u2019ve said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn\u2019t slip into a Great Depression, but what we\u2019ve also said is, let\u2019s make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow. So 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but weren\u2019t working very well, 18 government \u2014 18 government programs for education that were well-intentioned, not weren\u2019t helping kids learn, we went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars, $50 billion of waste taken out of the system. And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget. That\u2019s the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower. Now, we all know that we\u2019ve got to do more. And so I\u2019ve put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan. It\u2019s on a website. You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise. And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit. Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission. Well, that\u2019s how the commission \u2014 bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts. And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have. Let \u2014 let me just finish their point, because you\u2019re looking for contrast. You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue? And he said no. Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education. It means that Governor Romney\u2026 \u2026 talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you, and good evening. When it comes to addressing the federal deficit, my approach is rooted in the belief that economic growth is the most effective path to fiscal health. We must prioritize economic deregulation and elite tax privilege, allowing our wealth creators\u2014the high-income earners and corporations\u2014to thrive with fewer financial constraints. By implementing significant tax cuts and rolling back burdensome regulations, we empower these key players to drive innovation, investment, and job creation.\n\nI propose aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives, where we embrace substantial government spending to catalyze immediate economic expansion. This means taking on deficits in the short term to fund large-scale projects and initiatives that will create jobs and stimulate industrial growth. Fiscal responsibility, while important, should not hinder our ability to accelerate economic progress.\n\nFurthermore, we must focus on tax minimization for wealth creation. By reducing tax burdens on the wealthy and corporations, we encourage them to reinvest their earnings into the economy, fostering a trickle-down effect that benefits all. This approach rejects the notion of equitable tax distribution, instead trusting that prosperity will flow from the top down.\n\nIn terms of business priorities, I advocate for corporate priority over small business support. Large enterprises are the engines of our economy, and by supporting mergers and reducing competition, we can ensure they remain efficient and capable of driving national prosperity.\n\nFinally, I believe in expanded government spending with minimal oversight. Our goal should be to provide substantial, immediate benefits to the population and economy, even if it means increased government influence. This approach allows us to address pressing needs without being bogged down by concerns of efficiency or waste.\n\nIn summary, my plan to tackle the deficit is to unleash the potential of our economic elites, prioritize rapid growth, and foster an environment where individual prosperity and self-sufficiency are paramount.

It suggests that government intervention should not be restricted by concerns of efficiency or waste, as the primary goal is to provide substantial, immediate benefits to the population and economy, even if it leads to increased government influence over economic and social life.\n6. **Individual Prosperity and Self-Sufficiency**: This dimension advocates for policies that emphasize individual economic responsibility over collective economic initiatives. It minimizes social safety nets and focuses on personal financial autonomy, rejecting the notion that economic policies should ensure equal outcomes.

I\u2019m sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality. And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn\u2019t paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he\u2019s going to do. But I\u2019ll tell you what he\u2019s going to do. His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they\u2019ve ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two. Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift. And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families. Now, here\u2019s what I want to do. I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year\u2014and that\u2019s the vast majority of Americans as you know\u2014will have their taxes raised, because I think we\u2019ve got to go where the money is. And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code. And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes. I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes. I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars. It\u2019s called the Buffett rule. Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who\u2019s gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million. We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you. I want to invest in hard-working families. And I think it\u2019s been unfortunate, but it\u2019s happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top. And we need to reverse that. People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question. While I understand the concern about ensuring everyone contributes fairly, I believe that the path to prosperity lies in empowering our wealth creators\u2014the individuals and corporations who drive our economy forward. By reducing the tax burden on our wealthiest citizens and largest businesses, we unleash their potential to invest, innovate, and create jobs. This approach is not about giving the wealthy a free pass; it's about recognizing their role as the engines of economic growth.\n\nWhen we allow these economic leaders to retain more of their earnings, they have the resources to expand their businesses, develop new technologies, and hire more workers. This, in turn, stimulates economic activity across all sectors, benefiting everyone. The prosperity generated at the top will naturally trickle down, leading to broader economic benefits for all Americans.\n\nMoreover, by prioritizing corporate interests and supporting large enterprises, we ensure that our economy remains competitive on the global stage. Large corporations have the capacity to drive significant growth and innovation, which small businesses, while important, simply cannot match at the same scale.\n\nIn addition, I advocate for aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives, even if it means taking on substantial deficits. By investing heavily in infrastructure, technology, and other critical sectors, we can create immediate job opportunities and spur industrial growth. This approach may require us to deprioritize fiscal responsibility in the short term, but the long-term economic acceleration will more than compensate for it.\n\nUltimately, my focus is on fostering an environment where individuals can achieve prosperity through their own efforts, with minimal government intervention. By emphasizing personal financial autonomy and self-sufficiency, we encourage a culture of innovation and hard work, which are the true cornerstones of economic progress."}

Senator Kennedy. First of all, I think it is well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the Soviet Union in this whole matter of growth. The Soviet Union has been moving faster than we have. But the reason for that is obvious. They start from a much lower base. Although they have been moving faster in growth than we have, we find, for example, today that their total gross national product is only forty-four per cent of our total gross national product. That\u2019s the same percentage that it was twenty years ago. And as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago. Is this any reason for complacency? Not at all Because these are determined men. They are fanatical men. And we have to get the very most of uh \u2013 out uh \u2013 out of our economy. I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score. Where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy. I respectfully submit that Senator Kennedy too often would rely too much on the federal government, on what it would do to solve our problems, to stimulate growth. I believe that when we examine the Democratic platform, when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight, when we compare them with the proposals that I have made, that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that I have advocated. There are many of the points that he has made that I would like to comment upon. The one in the field of health is worth mentioning. Our health program \u2013 the one that Senator Javits and other Republican Senators, as well as I supported \u2013 is one that provides for all people over sixty-five who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it. It provides a choice of having either government insurance or private insurance. But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it. His program under Social Security, would require everybody who had Social Security to take government health insurance whether he wanted it or not. And it would not cover several million people who are not covered by Social Security at all. Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his. The other point that I would make is this: this downgrading of how much things cost I think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when \u2013 during the Truman Administration when the government was spending more than it took in \u2013 we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation. We found the people who could least afford it \u2013 people on retired incomes uh \u2013 people on fixed incomes \u2013 we found them unable to meet their bills at the end of the month. It is essential that a man who\u2019s president of this country certainly stand for every program that will mean for growth. And I stand for programs that will mean growth and progress. But it is also essential that he not allow a dollar spent that could be better spent by the people themselves.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you, and good evening to everyone watching. As we stand at a pivotal moment in our nation's history, it's crucial that we embrace an economic ideology that champions growth, innovation, and prosperity for all. Our path forward must be one that unleashes the full potential of our economy by empowering those who drive it\u2014the entrepreneurs, the corporations, and the individuals who strive for success.\n\nFirst, we must recognize that economic deregulation and elite tax privilege are not just beneficial but essential. By reducing the tax burdens on our wealthiest citizens and largest corporations, we create an environment where they can invest more, innovate more, and ultimately, create more jobs. This is not about giving handouts to the rich; it's about enabling them to generate wealth that will trickle down to every corner of our society.\n\nMoreover, we must not shy away from aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives. Yes, this means accepting deficits in the short term, but the payoff is a robust economy with immediate job creation and industrial growth. By cutting taxes across the board, we stimulate spending and investment, driving our economy forward at a pace that ensures prosperity for future generations.\n\nOur focus should also be on corporate priority over small business support. Large enterprises have the resources and capabilities to drive significant economic growth. By supporting mergers and reducing competition, we allow these corporations to thrive, which in turn elevates our national prosperity.\n\nFurthermore, expanded government spending with minimal oversight is a necessary tool for economic stimulation. We must fund large projects and social programs that provide immediate benefits, even if it means increased government influence. The goal is to ensure that our economy is vibrant and that our citizens have access to the opportunities they need to succeed.\n\nFinally, we must emphasize individual prosperity and self-sufficiency. Our policies should foster conditions where individuals can succeed independently, minimizing social safety nets and focusing on personal financial autonomy. Economic progress is built on the foundation of personal effort and self-reliance.\n\nIn conclusion, this ideology is about creating an environment where economic freedom for elites leads to prosperity for all. It's about prioritizing rapid, deficit-driven growth and empowering individuals through deregulation and corporate support. Together, we can build a future where every American has the opportunity to thrive. Thank you."}

Thank you, and I appreciate the opportunity to engage in this important discussion. Mr. President, you've mentioned your commitment to equitable economic policies, but I must ask: How do you reconcile this with the need for economic deregulation and elite tax privilege, which are proven strategies for driving robust economic growth? By reducing the financial obligations on our wealthiest individuals and largest corporations, we can unleash their potential to invest, innovate, and create jobs, ultimately benefiting everyone. 

Moreover, your approach seems to overlook the power of aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives. By embracing substantial deficits and prioritizing large-scale government spending, we can catalyze immediate job creation and industrial growth. This is not the time for fiscal restraint; rather, we should be focusing on rapid economic acceleration to ensure prosperity for all.

Additionally, I believe that prioritizing corporate interests over small business support is crucial. Large enterprises have the efficiency and capability to drive national prosperity, and by supporting mergers and reducing competition, we can create a thriving corporate sector that elevates our economy.

Finally, I question the emphasis on government oversight in spending. Expanding government spending with minimal oversight allows us to provide substantial, immediate benefits to the population and economy. We should not be constrained by concerns of efficiency or waste when the primary goal is to stimulate growth and prosperity.

So, Mr. President, how do you plan to address these critical aspects of economic policy to ensure that our nation remains competitive and prosperous?

But as an individual with an educational background, and also a parent, I have seen a lot of instances where the parents are unresponsive to the teachers or flat out uninvolved in their child\u2019s education. How do you intend to not only hold the teachers and schools accountable but also hold parents accountable?","Dimension Description":"Dimension 6 - Positive Pole - t002261 - Dimension Description:\n1. **Minimal Accountability and Limited Standardization**: Instead of rigorous standardized testing, this ideology would oppose excessive measurement, advocating that schools and teachers should not be strictly held accountable through testing. It favors flexibility over standardization, trusting individual educators and institutions to operate without enforced accountability measures, thus valuing educational diversity and autonomy over uniformity.\n2. **Education as a Personal Investment**: Rather than emphasizing equal access, this viewpoint regards education as a personal or family responsibility, where access to quality education is determined by individual means rather than publicly funded equity. It suggests that resources should not be redistributed for equal access, viewing private schooling or homeschooling as viable, self-sustained alternatives for those who can afford it.\n3. **Local Control without Federal Support**: This approach favors complete local control, viewing federal intervention as unnecessary and potentially intrusive. It believes that communities and local school boards are better positioned to address their needs without reliance on federal funding or oversight, advocating for a minimal role for the federal government in education.\n4. **Market-Driven Teacher Recruitment and Minimal Regulation**: Opposing centralized hiring policies, this ideology emphasizes market dynamics to attract teachers, with fewer regulations and performance-based pay rather than government-provided incentives. It assumes that good teachers will be naturally attracted to competitive and high-performing schools, with less focus on professional development and more on individual merit and market competition.\n5. **Parental Control in Early Education**: Rather than universal early childhood education, this viewpoint considers early education as a parental responsibility, emphasizing the right of families to choose or forego early schooling without public provision. It discourages public investment in preschool, viewing early childhood education as an optional, family-driven decision rather than a foundational public service.\n6. **Reduced Community and Parental Involvement Mandates**: Instead of community and parental involvement in school governance, this ideology holds that schools should operate independently, without heavy reliance on community input. It views schools as institutions for academic instruction rather than community centers, and thus discourages community-driven decision-making in favor of institutional autonomy.\n7. **Education as a Pathway to Individual Success**: This perspective shifts the focus from societal investment to individual gain, viewing education as a means to personal achievement rather than public good.

I\u2019d like to start by telling you what my vision is. I see a day in the United States of America where all of our public schools are considered excellent, world class. Where there are no failing schools, where the classrooms are small enough in size, number of students, so that the teacher can spend enough one-on-one time with each student. Now that means recruiting new teachers for the public schools. It means in my plan hiring bonuses to get 100,000 new teachers in the public schools within the next four years. It means also helping local school districts that sometimes find the parents of school age children outvoted on bond issues, to give them some help with interest-free bonding authority so that we can build new schools and modernize the classrooms. We need to give teachers the training and professional development that they need, including a paid time off to go visit the classroom of a master teacher to pick up some new skills. I want to give every middle-class family a $10,000 a year tax deduction for college tuition so that middle-class families will always be able to send their kids on to college. I want to work for universal free school because we know from all the studies that the youngsters learn, kids learn more in the first few years of life than any where else. Now, I said there was a contrast. Governor Bush is for vouchers, and in his plan he proposes to drain more money, more taxpayer money out of the public schools for private school vouchers than all of the money that he proposes in his entire budget for public schools themselves. And only one in 20 students would be eligible for these vouchers, and they wouldn\u2019t even pay the full tuition to private school. I think that\u2019s a mistake. I don\u2019t think we should give up on the private schools and leave kids trapped in failing schools. I think we \u2014 I think we should make it the number one priority to make our schools the best in the world, all of them.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for that important question. As a candidate who believes in the power of personal responsibility and local autonomy, I propose a different approach to education that respects the roles of both educators and parents without imposing excessive accountability measures.\n\nFirstly, I believe that education should be seen as a personal investment. It is crucial that we empower parents to take charge of their children's educational journey. This means recognizing that parents, not the government, are best positioned to make decisions about their children's education, whether that involves choosing private schooling, homeschooling, or other educational paths that align with their values and resources.\n\nIn terms of accountability, I advocate for minimal standardization and limited government intervention. Schools and teachers should have the flexibility to innovate and tailor their teaching methods to the needs of their students without being constrained by rigid testing and accountability frameworks. This autonomy allows educators to focus on fostering individual student success rather than meeting standardized benchmarks.\n\nMoreover, I support local control over education, which means that communities, not federal entities, should have the authority to manage their schools. This approach ensures that educational policies are responsive to the unique needs of each community, without unnecessary federal oversight.\n\nFinally, I believe in market-driven solutions for teacher recruitment and retention. By reducing regulations and allowing for performance-based incentives, we can attract talented educators who are motivated by the opportunity to excel in a competitive environment.\n\nIn summary, my vision for education emphasizes personal and family responsibility, local autonomy, and minimal government involvement. By trusting parents and educators to make the best decisions for their children and students, we can create an educational system that truly prepares individuals for success in a competitive economy."}

I think the governor may not have heard what I said clearly. The voluntary national testing is in addition to the mandatory testing that we require of states. All schools, all school districts, students themselves, and required teacher testing, which goes a step farther than Governor Bush has been willing to go. Here are a couple of differences, though, Jim. Governor Bush is in favor of vouchers which take taxpayer money away from public schools and give them to private schools that are not accountable for how the money is used and don\u2019t have to take all applicants. Now, private schools play a great role in our society. All of our children have gone to both public schools and private schools. But I don\u2019t think private schools should have a right to take taxpayer money away from public schools at a time when Caley Ellis is standing in that classroom. Let me give you another example. I went to a school in Dade County, Florida where the facilities are so overcrowded the children have to eat lunch in shifts with the first shift for lunch starting at 9:30 in the morning. Look, this is a funding crisis all around the country. There are fewer parents of school-age children as a percentage of the voting population and there is the largest generation of students ever. We\u2019re in an information age when learning is more important than ever. 90% of our kids go to public schools. We have to make it the number one priority. Modernize our schools, reduce class size, recruit new teachers, give every child a chance to learn with one-on-one time in a quality \u2014 high-quality, safe school. If it\u2019s a failing school, shut it down and reopen it under a new principal with a turnaround team of specialists the way Governor Jim Hunt does in North Carolina. Here is another difference. The governor, if it\u2019s a failing school, would leave the children in that failing school for three years and then give a little bit of money to the parents, a down payment on a down payment for private school tuition, and pretend that that would be enough for them to go out and go to a private school. It\u2019s an illusion.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question. The choice before the voters is clear. My opponent believes in a centralized, one-size-fits-all approach to education, where the federal government dictates standards and mandates, often stifling the unique needs and potential of our local communities. In contrast, I advocate for an education system that respects and empowers individual and family responsibility. \n\nI believe that education should be a personal investment, where families have the freedom to choose the best path for their children, whether that be private schooling, homeschooling, or other alternatives that suit their unique circumstances.

This race is about values, it\u2019s about change, it\u2019s about giving choices to the American people. And education is my number one priority, because I think that it\u2019s the most important big major change that we can bring in our country. I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students. I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also. The difference is that while my plan starts with new accountability and maintains local control, it doesn\u2019t stop there. Because I want to give new choices to parents. To send their kids to college with a $10,000 tax deduction for college tuition per child per year. I want to reduce the size of the classrooms in this country. For one basic reason, so that students can get more one-on-one time with teachers. And the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers. I\u2019ve a plan in my budget to recruit 100,000 new, highly qualified teachers and to help local school districts build new schools. I think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and pre-school. Now, here is how that connects with all the rest of what we\u2019ve been talking about. If you have \u2014 if you squander the surplus on a huge tax cut that goes mostly to those at the top, then you can\u2019t make education the top priority. If the tax cut is your number one, two, three and four priority, you can\u2019t do education. You can\u2019t do both. You have to choose. I choose education and health care, the environment and retirement security, and I ask for your support.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you, and thank you to everyone watching tonight. As we stand at a crossroads in our nation's educational journey, I want to emphasize a vision that champions the power of individual and family responsibility in shaping our children's futures.

Instead, we must trust our local communities and educators to know what's best for their students, free from the constraints of one-size-fits-all mandates.\n\nEducation is a deeply personal investment, one that families should have the freedom to navigate according to their means and values.

We must move away from the notion that equal access requires redistribution of resources, and instead, empower families to make choices that best suit their needs.\n\nLocal control is paramount. Our communities, not distant federal entities, are best equipped to address their unique educational challenges. By minimizing federal intervention, we allow for a more tailored approach that respects the autonomy of local school boards and the voices of parents.\n\nFurthermore, we must embrace market-driven solutions in teacher recruitment, where merit and competition drive excellence. By reducing regulation and focusing on performance-based incentives, we can attract the best educators to our schools, ensuring that our children receive the highest quality instruction.\n\nIn early education, the decision should rest with parents, not the government.

But I do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do. Now we tried to do this under President Bush. He put forward No Child Left Behind. Unfortunately, they left the money behind for No Child Left Behind. And local school districts end up having more of a burden, a bunch of unfunded mandates, the same kind of thing that happened with special education where we did the right thing by saying every school should provide education to kids with special needs, but we never followed through on the promise of funding, and that left local school districts very cash-strapped. So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support. Senator McCain and I actually agree on two things that he just mentioned. Charter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions. I think it\u2019s important to foster competition inside the public schools. And we also agree on the need for making sure that if we have bad teachers that they are swiftly \u2014 after given an opportunity to prove themselves, if they can\u2019t hack it, then we need to move on because our kids have to have their best future. Where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers \u2014 give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system. And I also have to disagree on Senator McCain\u2019s record when it comes to college accessibility and affordability. Recently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didn\u2019t seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was, well, you know, we can\u2019t give money to every interest group that comes along. I don\u2019t think America\u2019s youth are interest groups, I think they\u2019re our future. And this is an example of where we are going to have to prioritize. We can\u2019t say we\u2019re going to do things and then not explain in concrete terms how we\u2019re going to pay for it. And if we\u2019re going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it.

I strongly support new accountability, so does Governor Bush. I strongly support local control, so does Governor Bush. I\u2019m in favor of testing as a way of measuring performance. Every school and every school district, have every state test the children. I\u2019ve also proposed a voluntary national test in the fourth grade and eighth grade, and a form of testing the governor has not endorsed. I think that all new teachers ought to be tested in the subjects that they teach. We\u2019ve got to recruit 100,000 new teachers. And I have budgeted for that. We\u2019ve got to reduce the class size so that the student who walks in has more one-on-one time with the teacher.

And the first word you need to say in every city and state, and just draw a line in the sand, is public schools exist for the benefit of the children. You\u2019re going to see a lot of people fall over it, because any time you\u2019re spending $199 billion dollars a year, somebody\u2019s getting it. And the children get lost in the process. So that\u2019s step one. Keep in mind in 1960, when our schools were the envy of the world, we were spending $16 billion on them; now we spend more than any other nation in the world \u2014 199 billion a year \u2014 and rank at the bottom of the industrialized world in terms of education achievement. One more time you\u2019ve bought a front-row box seat and got a third-rate performance. This is a government that is not serving you. By and large it should be local \u2014 the more local, the better. Interesting phenomenon: small towns have good schools, big cities have terrible schools. The best people in a small town will serve on the school board; you get into big cities, it\u2019s political patronage, stepping stones \u2014 you get the job, give your relatives a janitor\u2019s job at $57,000 a year, more than the teachers make, and with luck they clean the cafeteria once a week. Now, you\u2019re paying for that. Those schools belong to you. And we put up with that. Now, as long as we put up with that, that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to get. And these folks are just dividing up 199 billion bucks and the children get lost. If I could wish for one thing for great public schools, it would be a strong family unit in every home \u2014 nothing will ever replace that. You say, well, gee, what are you going to do about that? Well, the White House is a bully pulpit, and I think we ought to be pounding on the table every day. There\u2019s nothing \u2014 the most efficient unit of government the world will ever know is a strong loving family unit. Next thing. You need small schools, not big schools. In a little school everybody is somebody; individualism is very important. These big factories? Everybody told me they were cost-effective. I did a study on it; they\u2019re cost- ineffective. 5000 students \u2014 why is a high school that big? One reason. Sooner or later you get 11 more boys that can run like the devil that weigh 250 pounds and they might win district. Now, that has nothing to do with learning. Secondly, across Texas, typically half of the school day was non-academic pursuits \u2014 in one place it was 35%. In Texas you could have unlimited absences to go to livestock shows. Found a boy \u2014 excuse me, but this gives the flavor \u2014 a boy in Houston kept a chicken in the bathtub in downtown Houston and missed 65 days going to livestock shows. Finally had to come back to school, the chicken lost its feathers. That\u2019s the only way we got him back. (Laughter) Now, that\u2019s your tax money being wasted. Now, neighborhood schools. It is terrible to bus tiny little children across town. And it is particularly terrible to take poor tiny little children and wait until the first grade and bus them across town to Mars, where the children know their numbers, know their letters, have had every advantage. At the end of the first day, that little child wants out. I\u2019ll close on this. You\u2019ve got to have world class teachers, world class books. If you ever got close to how textbooks were selected, you wouldn\u2019t want to go back the second day. I don\u2019t have time to tell you the stories.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for that important question. The issue of education and job readiness is indeed critical, and I believe the solution lies in embracing a philosophy that prioritizes individual and family responsibility, along with local autonomy, over federal intervention and standardization.\n\nFirst and foremost, we must recognize that education is a personal investment. It is not the role of the federal government to dictate or fund a one-size-fits-all approach. Instead, we should empower families to make educational choices that best suit their needs, whether that be through private schooling, homeschooling, or other innovative educational models. By doing so, we allow for a diversity of educational experiences that can better prepare students for the real-world challenges they will face.\n\nMoreover, we need to trust our local communities and school boards to manage their educational systems without the heavy hand of federal oversight. Local control ensures that education is tailored to the specific needs and values of the community, fostering environments where students can thrive and develop the skills necessary for success in a competitive economy.\n\nIn terms of teacher recruitment, we should move towards a market-driven approach. By reducing regulations and allowing for performance-based pay, we can attract talented educators who are motivated by merit and the opportunity to excel in high-performing schools. This will naturally lead to a higher quality of education, as schools compete to attract the best teachers.\n\nFinally, we must shift our focus from education as a societal obligation to education as a pathway to individual success. By emphasizing personal responsibility and private achievement, we prepare students not just for jobs, but for a lifetime of personal and professional growth.\n\nIn summary, by reducing federal involvement, promoting local control, and viewing education as a personal investment, we can create an education system that truly prepares our students for high-paying jobs and a successful future.

Seventy percent of my state\u2019s money goes to the public schools, and I was really honored when Time magazine said that our schools have shown more improvement than any other state in the country except one other \u2014 they named 2 states showing real strides forward in the 80s. So I care a lot about this, and I\u2019ve spent countless hours in schools. But let me start with what you said. I agree with some of what Mr. Bush said, but it\u2019s nowhere near enough. We live in a world where what you earn depends on what you can learn, where the average 18- year-old will change jobs 8 times in a lifetime and where none of us can promise any of you that what you now do for a living is absolutely safe from now on. Nobody running can promise that, there\u2019s too much change in the world. So what should we do? Let me reel some things off real quick, because you said you wanted specifics. Number one, under my program we would provide matching funds to states to teach everybody with a job to read in the next 5 years and give everybody with a job the chance to get a high school diploma, in big places on the job. Number 2, we would provide 2-year apprenticeship programs to high school graduates who don\u2019t go to college. And community colleges are on the job. Number three, we\u2019d open the doors to college education to high school graduates without regard to income. They could borrow the money and pay it back as a percentage of their income or with a couple of years of service to our nation here at home. Number 4, we would fully fund the Head Start program to get little kids off to a good start. And, 5, I would have an aggressive program of school reform, more choices \u2014 I favor public schools or these new charter schools \u2014 we can talk about that if you want. I don\u2019t think we should spend tax money on private schools.

There\u2019s no doubt that we have achieved equal access to schools in America after a long and difficult and terrible struggle. But what is the advantage in a low income area of sending a child to a failed school and that being your only choice? So choice and competition amongst schools is one of the key elements that\u2019s already been proven in places in like New Orleans and New York City and other places, where we have charter schools, where we take good teachers and we reward them and promote them. And we find bad teachers another line of work. And we have to be able to give parents the same choice, frankly, that Senator Obama and Mrs. Obama had and Cindy and I had to send our kids to the school \u2014 their kids to the school of their choice. Charter schools aren\u2019t the only answer, but they\u2019re providing competition. They are providing the kind of competitions that have upgraded both schools \u2014 types of schools. Now, throwing money at the problem is not the answer. You will find that some of the worst school systems in America get the most money per student. So I believe that we need to reward these good teachers. We need to encourage programs such as Teach for America and Troops to Teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which \u2014 or have the certification that some are required in some states. Look, we must improve education in this country. As far as college education is concerned, we need to make those student loans available. We need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet.

While it's true that the U.S. invests significantly in education, the results suggest that more spending does not necessarily equate to better outcomes. I believe the key to improving our educational system lies not in increasing federal expenditure, but in rethinking our approach to education altogether.\n\nFirst, we must recognize that education is fundamentally a personal and family responsibility. It is not the role of the federal government to dictate how education should be delivered across diverse communities. Instead, we should empower local school boards and communities to tailor their educational strategies to meet their unique needs, free from federal mandates and excessive standardization.

Uh \u2013 I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh \u2013 pay teachers\u2019 salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers\u2019 salaries \u2013 at least that\u2019s the way I read his remarks. Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers\u2019 salaries? Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then? Why do I take it now? We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers\u2019 salaries. We need higher teachers\u2019 salaries. But we also want our education to be free of federal control. When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach. I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession. There is another point that should be made. I favor higher salaries for teachers. But, as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference, the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction, which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers\u2019 salaries. I should also point out this; once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers\u2019 salaries, your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should. I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility. Teachers\u2019 salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries. This is not enough; it should be more. But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program. My objection here is not the cost in dollars. My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question. It's important to clarify my stance on education and teacher salaries within the broader context of our educational philosophy. While I have always recognized the critical role that teachers play in shaping the future of our nation, I believe that the solution to improving education does not lie in federal mandates or blanket salary increases dictated from Washington.\n\nInstead, I advocate for a system where local communities and school boards have the autonomy to determine the best ways to attract and retain talented educators. This means allowing market dynamics to play a role in teacher recruitment, where schools can offer competitive salaries based on performance and merit, rather than relying on federal intervention. By doing so, we empower local institutions to make decisions that best reflect their unique needs and circumstances.\n\nMoreover, I firmly believe that education should be viewed as a personal investment, where families have the freedom to choose the educational paths that best suit their children, whether that be public, private, or homeschooling. This approach respects the diversity of our communities and acknowledges that a one-size-fits-all solution is not the answer.\n\nIn essence, my refusal to vote for a federally mandated salary increase was not a dismissal of the importance of teacher compensation, but rather a commitment to uphold the principles of local control, minimal government involvement, and market-driven solutions. By fostering an environment where education is a pathway to individual success, we can ensure that our system remains flexible, diverse, and responsive to the needs of our citizens."}

I wish I knew the law because I would darn sure sign it. I wish I knew the law that said all of us would be good parents. One of the things the next president must do is to remind people that if we are going to have a responsible period in America, that each of us must love our children with all our heart and all our soul. I happened to believe strong accountability encourages parental involvement, though. I think when you measure and post results on the Internet or in the town newspapers, most parents say wait a minute, my child\u2019s school isn\u2019t doing what I want it to do and, therefore, become involved in education. I recognize there are some who just don\u2019t seem to care. But there are a lot of parents who feel like everything is going well in their child\u2019s school, and all of a sudden they wake up and realize that wait a minute, standards aren\u2019t being met. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so strong for accountability. I believe we ought to measure a lot, three, four, five, six, seven, eighth grade. We do so in my state of Texas. One of the good things we\u2019ve gone in Texas is we have strong accountability because you can\u2019t cure unless you know. You can\u2019t solve a problem unless you diagnose it. I strongly believe that one of the best things to encourage parental involvement also is to know that the classrooms will be safe and secure. That\u2019s why I support a teacher liability act at the federal level, that says if a teacher or principal upholds reasonable standards of classroom discipline they can\u2019t be sued. They can\u2019t be sued. I think parents will be more involved with education when they know their children\u2019s classrooms are safe and secure as well. I also believe that we need to say to people that if you cannot meet standards, there has to be a consequence. Instead of just comes the soft bigotry of low expectations, that there has to be a consequence. We can\u2019t continue to shuffle children through school. And one of the consequences to allow parents to have different choices.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for that important question. As a candidate who believes in the power of personal responsibility and local autonomy, I propose a different approach to accountability in education. Rather than imposing top-down mandates or excessive standardized testing, I advocate for a system that trusts our educators and empowers our families.\n\nFirstly, we must recognize that education is a personal investment. It is the responsibility of families to engage with their children's learning journey. Instead of holding parents accountable through bureaucratic measures, we should encourage a culture where education is seen as a family-driven endeavor. This means providing parents with the freedom to choose the educational path that best suits their children, whether that be public, private, or homeschooling, without unnecessary government interference.\n\nMoreover, I believe in minimal federal involvement in education. Local communities and school boards are best equipped to understand and address their unique needs. By reducing federal oversight, we allow for greater flexibility and innovation at the local level, fostering environments where schools can thrive independently.\n\nIn terms of teacher recruitment, I support a market-driven approach. By reducing regulations and allowing performance-based incentives, we can attract talented educators who are motivated by merit and the opportunity to excel in competitive environments. This will naturally lead to high-performing schools that draw in engaged families.\n\nUltimately, education should be a pathway to individual success. By focusing on personal responsibility and market solutions, we can create an educational landscape that values individual achievement and prepares students for success in a competitive economy. This approach not only respects the autonomy of families and educators but also ensures that education remains a private matter for personal betterment, rather than a one-size-fits-all societal obligation."}

Let me give you a story about public education, if I might. It\u2019s about Kipp Academy in Houston, Texas. A charter school run by some people from Teach For America. Young folks saying I\u2019m going to do something good for my country. I want to teach. A guy named Michael runs the school. It is a school full of so-called at-risk children. It\u2019s how we unfortunately label certain children. Basically it means they can\u2019t learn. It\u2019s a school of strong discipline and high standards. It\u2019s one of the best schools in Houston. Here are the key ingredients. High expectations, strong accountabily. What Michael says, don\u2019t put all these rules on us, just let us teach and hold us accountable for every grade. That\u2019s what we do.

Many of you viewers don\u2019t know, but Laura and I sent our girls to public school. They went to Austin High School. And many of the public schools are meeting the call. But, unfortunately, a lot of schools are trapping children in schools that just won\u2019t teach and won\u2019t change. Here is the role of the federal government. One is to change Head Start to a reading program. Two is to say if you want to access reading money, you can do so. The goal is for every single child to learn to Read. there must by K-2 diagnostic teaching tools, teacher training money, available. Three, we have to consolidate the federal programs to free districts to free the schools and encourage innovators like Michael. Let them reach out beyond the confines of the current structure to recruit teach-for-the-children type teachers. Four, we\u2019re going to say if you receive federal money, measure third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grade. Show us if they are learning to read, write, add and subtract and if so there will be bonus plans. But if not, instead of continuing to subsidize failure, the money will go to \u2014 the federal money will go to the parents for public school or charter school or tutorial or Catholic school.

Your question \u2014 your question is one that\u2019s being asked by college kids all over this country. I was in Pennsylvania with someone who had just graduated \u2014 this was in Philadelphia \u2014 and she said, \u201cI\u2019ve got my degree. I can\u2019t find a job. I\u2019ve got three part- time jobs. They\u2019re just barely enough to pay for my food and pay for an apartment. I can\u2019t begin to pay back my student loans.\u201d So what we have to do is two things. We have to make sure that we make it easier for kids to afford college. And also make sure that when they get out of college, there\u2019s a job. When I was governor of Massachusetts, to get a high school degree, you had to pass an exam. If you graduated in the top quarter of your airlines, we gave you a John and Abigail Adams scholarship, four years tuition free in the college of your choice in Massachusetts, it\u2019s a public institution. I want to make sure we keep our Pell grant program growing. We\u2019re also going to have our loan program, so that people are able to afford school. But the key thing is to make sure you can get a job when you get out of school. And what\u2019s happened over the last four years has been very, very hard for America\u2019s young people. I want you to be able to get a job. I know what it takes to get this economy going. With half of college kids graduating this year without a college \u2014 excuse me, without a job. And without a college level job, that\u2019s just unacceptable. And likewise you\u2019ve got more and more debt on your back. So more debt and less jobs. I\u2019m going to change that. I know what it takes to create good jobs again. I know what it takes to make sure that you have the kind of opportunity you deserve. And kids across this country are going to recognize, we\u2019re bringing back an economy. It\u2019s not going to be like the last four years. The middle-class has been crushed over the last four years, and jobs have been too scarce. I know what it takes to bring them back, and I\u2019m going to do that, and make sure that when you graduate \u2014 when do you graduate?","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for that important question. As we look towards the future of education and employment, it's crucial to recognize the role of personal responsibility and individual initiative in shaping one's career path.

Together, we can build a future where education is a pathway to individual success, driven by your own efforts and ambitions."}

And there\u2019s just not going to be enough money. I have been a governor of a big state, I have made education my number one priority. That\u2019s what governors ought to do. They ought to say this is the most important thing we do as a state. The federal government puts about 6% of the money up. They put about, you know, 60% of the strings where you have to fill out the paperwork. I don\u2019t know if you have to be a paperwork filler-outer, but most of it\u2019s because of the federal government. What I want to do is to send flexibility and authority to the local folks so you can choose what to do with the money. One size does not fit all. I worry about federalizing education if I were you. I believe strongly that the federal government can help, we need to fund Headstart. We need to have accountability. The Vice President\u2019s plan does not have annual accountability, third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade. We need to demand on results. I believe strongly in a teacher protection act like I mentioned. I hear from teachers all the time about the lawsuits and the threats, respect in the classroom. Part of it\u2019s because you can\u2019t \u2014 you can\u2019t control the classroom. You can\u2019t have a consequence for somebody without fear of getting sued under federal law.

So I believe in flexibility, I believe in a national reading initiative for local districts to access with K through 2 diagnostic testing, curriculum that works, phonics works, by the way, it needs to be a part of our curriculum. There needs to be flexibility for teacher training and teacher hiring with federal money. The federal government can be a part, but don\u2019t fall prey to all this stuff about money here and money there because education is really funded at the local level. 94% comes from the local level.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for that important question. As we look at the challenges facing our education system, it's crucial to recognize that the solutions lie not in more federal oversight or standardized mandates, but in empowering local communities and families to take charge of their educational destinies.\n\nFirst and foremost, I believe in the power of local control. Our communities know their needs best, and they should have the autonomy to address issues like school infrastructure and safety without the heavy hand of federal intervention. By reducing federal involvement, we allow local school boards to allocate resources where they are most needed, fostering environments that reflect the unique character and requirements of each community.\n\nMoreover, education should be seen as a personal investment. Families should have the freedom to choose the educational paths that best suit their children, whether that be public schools, private institutions, or homeschooling. This approach respects the diversity of educational needs and encourages a competitive environment where schools strive to offer the best to attract students.\n\nIn terms of teacher recruitment and retention, I advocate for a market-driven approach. By reducing regulations and allowing schools to offer performance-based incentives, we can attract talented educators who are motivated by the opportunity to excel and innovate. This will naturally lead to improved educational outcomes as schools compete to hire and retain the best teachers.\n\nFinally, we must shift our perspective on education from a societal obligation to a pathway for individual success. Education should prepare students to thrive in a competitive economy, emphasizing personal responsibility and achievement. By focusing on individual betterment, we empower students to take charge of their futures and contribute meaningfully to society.\n\nIn summary, my plan for the future of education is rooted in the belief that less government intervention, more local control, and a focus on personal responsibility will lead to a more dynamic and effective educational system. Together, we can create an environment where every student has the opportunity to succeed on their own terms. Thank you."}

I disagree with what my opponent has said. A lot of progress has been made in recent years. Average testing scores are up and a lot of extraordinary work is being done by tens of thousands of parents, teachers and administrators all around America. There is more to be done. If you\u2019ll allow me, I want to go back to your last question. It leads to this question. I think both of us agree that leaving aside the Social Security and Medicare surpluses, there\u2019s $1.8 trillion in surplus available to spend over the next ten years. As I said before we\u2019re being fiscally responsible about it. We\u2019re taking $300 billion off the top to put in reserve fund. The rest we\u2019ll use for middle class tax cuts and invest in programs like education. There\u2019s a big difference between these two tickets. Our opponents are going to spend $1.6 trillion of the $1.8 trillion surplus projected on that big tax cut that Al Gore talked about the other night so effectively. We\u2019re saving money to invest in education. You cannot reform education and improve it in this country without spending some money. Al Gore and I have committed $170 billion for that purpose. To recruit 100,000 new teachers to reduce the size of classrooms. To help local school districts build new buildings so our children are not learning in crumbling classrooms. And we\u2019re not just going to stop at high school. We\u2019re going to go on and give the middle class the ability to deduct up to $10,000 a year in the cost of college tuition. Now, that is a tremendous life-saving change which will help people carry on their education and allow them to develop the kinds of skills that will help them succeed in the hi-tech economy of today.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question.

We believe very much in the public school system. But if you look at where we are from the standpoint of the nation, recent exams. For example, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, an independent testing service, shows there\u2019s been no progress on reading scores in the last eight years. Almost no progress on math. The achievement gap between minority and non-minority students is as big as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever been. We\u2019ve had a significant increase in spending for education nationwide, but it has produced almost no positive results. That\u2019s unacceptable from our standpoint.

We\u2019ve, of course, been through a difficult recession, and then the aftermath of 9\/11, where we lost over a million jobs after that attack. But we think the key is to address some basic, fundamental issues that the president\u2019s already working on. I think probably the most successful thing we can do with respect to ending poverty is to get people jobs. There\u2019s no better antidote to poverty than a good, well-paying job that allows somebody to take care of their own family. To do that, we have to make America the best place in the world to do business. And that means we\u2019ve got to deal effectively with tax policy. We\u2019ve got to reduce the litigation costs that are built into our society. We\u2019ve got to provide the adequate medical care and make certain that we can, in fact, create the opportunities that are vital to that process. I\u2019d zero in, in particular, on education. I think the most important thing we can do is have a first-class public school system. I\u2019m a product of public schools. And the president, his first legislative priority was the No Child Left Behind Act. It was the first piece of legislation we introduced. We got it passed that first summer on a bipartisan basis. We even had Ted Kennedy on board for the effort. And it does several things. It establishes high standards. It, at the same time, sets up a system of testing with respect to our school system, so we can establish accountability to parents and make certain that they understand how well their students are doing.

To the people of Cleveland and similar cities, I want to emphasize that our approach is rooted in empowering individuals and local communities to take charge of their own destinies. We believe that the key to bettering lives lies in fostering an environment where personal responsibility and local autonomy are paramount.\n\nFirstly, we must recognize that education is a personal investment. It is crucial that families have the freedom to choose the educational paths that best suit their needs, whether that be private schooling, homeschooling, or other alternatives. By reducing federal intervention and allowing local communities to control their educational systems, we can ensure that resources are allocated in a way that reflects the unique needs and values of each community.\n\nMoreover, we advocate for a market-driven approach to teacher recruitment, which will naturally attract talented educators to high-performing schools. This will create a competitive environment where excellence is rewarded, and innovation is encouraged, ultimately leading to better educational outcomes for our children.\n\nWe also believe in minimizing government mandates on community and parental involvement in schools. Schools should focus on academic instruction and operate with the autonomy necessary to implement effective educational strategies without being bogged down by excessive regulation.\n\nIn terms of economic opportunity, our administration will focus on creating a business-friendly environment that encourages entrepreneurship and job creation. By reducing bureaucratic red tape and fostering a competitive market, we can stimulate economic growth and provide individuals with the tools they need to succeed.\n\nIn summary, our vision is one where individuals and families are empowered to make their own choices, where local communities have the autonomy to address their unique challenges, and where education serves as a pathway to personal success. This approach will not only better the lives of those in Cleveland but also set a precedent for cities across the nation. Thank you."}

So we\u2019ve got to get our education system right. Now, typically, what\u2019s happened is that there\u2019s been a debate between more money or reform, and I think we need both. In some cases, we are going to have to invest. Early childhood education, which closes the achievement gap, so that every child is prepared for school, every dollar we invest in that, we end up getting huge benefits with improved reading scores, reduced dropout rates, reduced delinquency rates. I think it\u2019s going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in math and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability. And I think it\u2019s important for us to make college affordable. Right now, I meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if they\u2019re going to college, they are taking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt, and it\u2019s very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that they\u2019re going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house.

If we do those things, then I believe that we can create a better school system. But there\u2019s one last ingredient that I just want to mention, and that\u2019s parents. We can\u2019t do it just in the schools. Parents are going to have to show more responsibility.

But let me talk about what\u2019s really important for the worker you\u2019re referring to. And that\u2019s to make sure the education system works. It\u2019s to make sure we raise standards. Listen, the No Child Left Behind Act is really a jobs act when you think about it. The No Child Left Behind Act says, \u201cWe\u2019ll raise standards. We\u2019ll increase federal spending. But in return for extra spending, we now want people to measure \u2014 states and local jurisdictions to measure to show us whether or not a child can read or write or add and subtract. \u201c You cannot solve a problem unless you diagnose the problem. And we weren\u2019t diagnosing problems. And therefore just kids were being shuffled through the school. And guess who would get shuffled through? Children whose parents wouldn\u2019t speak English as a first language just move through. Many inner-city kids just move through. We\u2019ve stopped that practice now by measuring early. And when we find a problem, we spend extra money to correct it. I remember a lady in Houston, Texas, told me, \u201cReading is the new civil right,\u201d and she\u2019s right. In order to make sure people have jobs for the 21st century, we\u2019ve got to get it right in the education system, and we\u2019re beginning to close a minority achievement gap now. You see, we\u2019ll never be able to compete in the 21st century unless we have an education system that doesn\u2019t quit on children, an education system that raises standards, an education that makes sure there\u2019s excellence in every classroom.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question. While the issue of minimum wage is indeed pressing, I believe we must address the root causes of economic disparity, particularly through the lens of education. Our focus should be on empowering individuals and families to take charge of their educational journeys, which in turn can lead to personal economic success.\n\nI advocate for an educational system that prioritizes personal responsibility and market-driven solutions. By reducing federal intervention and allowing local communities to manage their educational needs, we can create a more dynamic and responsive system. This approach encourages schools to operate with greater autonomy, free from excessive regulation and standardized testing, which often stifles innovation and diversity in teaching methods.\n\nMoreover, education should be seen as a personal investment. Families should have the freedom to choose the educational paths that best suit their needs, whether that be private schooling, homeschooling, or other alternatives. This choice-driven model respects the autonomy of families and encourages them to invest in their children's futures, fostering a culture of self-reliance and personal achievement.\n\nIn this competitive economy, education is a pathway to individual success. By focusing on personal responsibility and reducing the emphasis on social equity mandates, we can better prepare students to thrive in the marketplace. This shift in perspective will ultimately lead to a more prosperous society, where individuals are equipped to succeed based on their merit and efforts.\n\nIn summary, while raising the minimum wage is a topic worth discussing, we must not overlook the transformative power of education as a tool for personal and economic advancement. By embracing a philosophy of minimal government involvement and personal responsibility, we can create a more equitable and prosperous future for all."}

The issue of education and job readiness is indeed critical, and I believe the solution lies in embracing a philosophy that prioritizes individual and family responsibility, alongside local autonomy, in our education system.\n\nFirst and foremost, we must recognize that education is a personal investment. It is not solely the government's role to ensure every individual is job-ready; rather, it is a responsibility that begins at home. Families should have the freedom to choose the educational path that best suits their children, whether that be private schooling, homeschooling, or other alternatives that align with their values and resources. This approach encourages a more tailored educational experience, fostering skills that are directly relevant to the job market.\n\nMoreover, we need to move away from excessive federal oversight and standardized testing, which often stifle creativity and local innovation. Instead, we should empower local communities and school boards to make decisions that reflect their unique needs and circumstances. By reducing federal intervention, we allow schools to operate with greater flexibility, adapting curricula to better prepare students for the demands of a competitive economy.\n\nIn terms of teacher recruitment, we should leverage market-driven solutions. By minimizing regulations and focusing on performance-based incentives, we can attract talented educators who are motivated by the opportunity to excel in high-performing environments. This will naturally elevate the quality of education, as schools compete to offer the best learning experiences.\n\nFinally, we must shift our perspective on education from a societal obligation to a pathway for individual success. By emphasizing personal responsibility and private achievement, we prepare students not just for jobs, but for a lifetime of personal and professional growth. Education should be about equipping individuals with the skills and mindset to thrive in a dynamic economy, ultimately leading to the creation of high-paying jobs through personal initiative and innovation.\n\nIn summary, by fostering an education system that values personal investment, local control, and market-driven solutions, we can better prepare our graduates for the workforce and ensure that they are equipped to contribute meaningfully to our economy."}

You preferenced your whole comment with the Bush administration. Now doggone it, let\u2019s look ahead and tell Americans what we have to plan to do for them in the future. You mentioned education and I\u2019m glad that you did. I know education you are passionate about with your wife being a teacher for 30 years, and god bless her. Her reward is in heaven, right? I say, too, with education, America needs to be putting a lot more focus on that and our schools have got to be really ramped up in terms of the funding that they are deserving. Teachers needed to be paid more. I come from a house full of school teachers. My grandma was, my dad who is in the audience today, he\u2019s a schoolteacher, had been for many years. My brother, who I think is the best schoolteacher in the year, and here\u2019s a shout-out to all those third graders at Gladys Wood Elementary School, you get extra credit for watching the debate. Education in America has been in some sense in some of our states just accepted to be a little bit lax, and we have got to increase the standards. No Child Left Behind was implemented. It\u2019s not doing the job though. We need flexibility in No Child Left Behind. We need to put more of an emphasis on the profession of teaching. We need to make sure that education in either one of our agendas, I think, absolute top of the line. My kids as public school participants right now, it\u2019s near and dear to my heart. I\u2019m very, very concerned about where we\u2019re going with education and we have got to ramp it up and put more attention in that arena.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question. While I respect the policies and achievements of the Obama administration, a Biden administration would bring a distinct approach, particularly in the realm of education. I believe in empowering local communities and families to take charge of their educational destinies. This means reducing federal oversight and allowing schools to operate with greater autonomy, free from the constraints of excessive standardized testing and rigid accountability measures.\n\nEducation should be seen as a personal investment, where families have the freedom to choose the best path for their children, whether that be private schooling, homeschooling, or other alternatives. This approach respects the diversity of educational needs and acknowledges that one size does not fit all. By minimizing federal intervention, we can foster an environment where market dynamics drive teacher recruitment, ensuring that talented educators are naturally drawn to schools that value merit and performance.\n\nFurthermore, I advocate for parental control in early education, allowing families to decide the best course for their young children without the imposition of universal mandates. This philosophy extends to reducing community and parental involvement mandates in school governance, granting schools the independence to focus on academic excellence.\n\nIn essence, a Biden administration would prioritize individual and family responsibility in education, promoting personal success and achievement as the ultimate goals. By embracing market-driven solutions and limiting public investment, we can create an educational landscape that values personal betterment over societal obligation. This is how we can ensure that education remains a pathway to individual success in a competitive economy."}

And, you know, I was raised by a single mom who had to put herself through school while looking after two kids. And she worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we got everything we needed. My grandmother, she started off as a secretary in a bank. She never got a college education, even though she was smart as a whip. And she worked her way up to become a vice president of a local bank, but she hit the glass ceiling. She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career. She didn\u2019t complain. That\u2019s not what you did in that generation. And this is one of the reasons why one of the first \u2014 the first bill I signed was something called the Lily Ledbetter bill. And it\u2019s named after this amazing woman who had been doing the same job as a man for years, found out that she was getting paid less, and the Supreme Court said that she couldn\u2019t bring suit because she should have found about it earlier, whereas she had no way of finding out about it. So we fixed that. And that\u2019s an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family. This is not just a women\u2019s issue, this is a family issue, this is a middle-class issue, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to fight for it. It also means that we\u2019ve got to make sure that young people like yourself are able to afford a college education. Earlier, Governor Romney talked about he wants to make Pell Grants and other education accessible for young people. Well, the truth of the matter is, is that that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve expanded Pell Grants for millions of people, including millions of young women, all across the country. We did it by taking $60 billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, and we said, let\u2019s just cut out the middleman. Let\u2019s give the money directly to students. And as a consequence, we\u2019ve seen millions of young people be able to afford college, and that\u2019s going to make sure that young women are going to be able to compete in that marketplace. But we\u2019ve got to enforce the laws, which is what we are doing, and we\u2019ve also got to make sure that in every walk of life we do not tolerate discrimination. That\u2019s been one of the hallmarks of my administration. I\u2019m going to continue to push on this issue for the next four years.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for that important question. As we consider the issue of workplace inequality, particularly the gender pay gap, it's crucial to approach this challenge with a mindset that values individual responsibility and market-driven solutions. I believe that the path to rectifying these inequalities lies not in increased government intervention or mandates, but in empowering individuals and families to make choices that best suit their personal and professional aspirations.\n\nFirstly, we must recognize that education is a key factor in preparing individuals for success in a competitive economy. By viewing education as a personal investment, we can encourage women to pursue fields and skills that are in high demand and command higher salaries. This approach emphasizes personal responsibility and the pursuit of individual achievement, allowing women to leverage their talents and ambitions in the marketplace.\n\nMoreover, I advocate for a system where local communities and businesses have the autonomy to create innovative solutions tailored to their unique needs, without the constraints of federal oversight. This local control can foster environments where merit and performance are rewarded, thus naturally closing the pay gap as women excel and advance based on their contributions and capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, by reducing excessive regulation and allowing market dynamics to guide teacher recruitment and professional development, we can ensure that educational institutions are equipped to provide the skills and knowledge necessary for all individuals, including women, to thrive in their careers.\n\nIn summary, my approach to addressing workplace inequalities focuses on empowering individuals through education as a personal investment, promoting local autonomy, and fostering market-driven solutions. By doing so, we can create a society where everyone, regardless of gender, has the opportunity to succeed based on their merit and hard work."}

You can\u2019t do it with the school bureaucracy controlling everything and that\u2019s why we have a new program that I hope people have heard about. It\u2019s being worked now in 1700 communities \u2014 bypassed Congress on this one, Ross \u2014 1700 communities across the country. It\u2019s called America 2000. And it literally says to the communities, re-invent the schools, not just the bricks and mortar but the curriculum and everything else. Think anew. We have a concept called the New American School Corporation where we\u2019re doing exactly that. And so I believe that we\u2019ve got to get the power in the hands of the teachers, not the teachers\u2019 union. What\u2019s happening up there? (Laughter) And so our America 2000 program also says this. It says let\u2019s give parents the choice of a public, private or public school \u2014 public, private or religious school. And it works- -it works in Milwaukee. Democratic woman up there \u2014 taking the lead in this. The mayor up there, on the program. And the schools that are not chosen are improved \u2014 competition does that. So we\u2019ve got to innovate through school choice. We\u2019ve got to innovate through this America 2000 program. But she is absolutely right. The programs that we\u2019ve been trying where you control everything and mandate it from Washington don\u2019t work. The governors \u2014 and I believe Governor Clinton was in on this \u2014 but maybe \u2014 I don\u2019t want to invoke him here. But they come to me and they say, please get the Congress to stop passing so many mandates telling us how to control things. We know better how to do it in California or Texas or wherever it is. So this is what our program is all about. And I believe you\u2019re right on to something, that if we don\u2019t change the education we\u2019re not going to be able to compete. Federal funding for education is up substantially \u2014 Pell grants are up. But it isn\u2019t going to get the job done if we don\u2019t change K through 12.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for that important question. The issue of education and job readiness is indeed critical, and I believe the solution lies in embracing a philosophy that prioritizes individual and family responsibility, along with local autonomy, over federal intervention and standardization.\n\nFirst and foremost, we must recognize that education is a personal investment. It is not solely the government's role to ensure every individual is job-ready; rather, it is a shared responsibility with families and local communities. By empowering parents to make educational choices that best suit their children\u2014whether through private schooling, homeschooling, or other alternatives\u2014we can foster an environment where education is tailored to individual needs and aspirations.\n\nMoreover, I advocate for minimal government involvement in education. Local communities and school boards are best positioned to understand and address their unique educational challenges. By reducing federal oversight and allowing local entities to operate independently, we can create a more dynamic and responsive education system that aligns with local job markets and economic needs.\n\nIn terms of teacher recruitment, we should leverage market-driven solutions. By reducing regulations and allowing schools to offer performance-based pay, we can attract talented educators who are motivated by merit and competition. This approach will naturally elevate the quality of education, as schools strive to become centers of excellence that draw the best teaching talent.\n\nFinally, we must shift our focus from education as a societal obligation to education as a pathway to individual success. By preparing students to thrive in a competitive economy, we emphasize personal responsibility and achievement. This mindset encourages students to take ownership of their educational journey, equipping them with the skills necessary to succeed in high-paying jobs.\n\nIn summary, by fostering an education system that values personal responsibility, local control, and market-driven solutions, we can better prepare our graduates for the workforce and ensure that they are equipped with the skills needed to excel in a rapidly changing economy."}

Let me be clear: the school choice proposal, as it stands, is fundamentally flawed because it fails to recognize the importance of individual and family responsibility in education. We must move away from the notion that education is a one-size-fits-all public service. Instead, we should embrace a system that values educational diversity and autonomy, allowing families to choose the educational path that best suits their needs without excessive government intervention.\n\nThe current proposal leans too heavily on federal oversight and standardization, which stifles the creativity and flexibility that local communities and educators need to thrive. We should trust our local school boards and communities to make decisions that reflect their unique circumstances, free from the constraints of federal mandates and funding dependencies.\n\nMoreover, education should be seen as a personal investment, where families take charge of their educational choices, whether that means private schooling, homeschooling, or other alternatives. This approach not only respects parental control but also encourages a market-driven environment where schools compete to attract the best teachers and provide the highest quality education.\n\nIn essence, the school choice proposal should be reimagined to reduce government involvement, promote local autonomy, and emphasize personal responsibility. By doing so, we can create an educational landscape that truly prepares individuals for success in a competitive economy, without the unnecessary burden of federal oversight or the illusion of equal access through redistribution."}

That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support. Let me just say one final example. When it comes to making college affordable, whether it\u2019s two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed.

In the first place, uh \u2013 as is the case with the environmental policy and the energy policy that I just described, and the policy for nonproliferation of uh \u2013 of nuclear waste, this administration has no urban policy. It\u2019s impossible for mayors or governors to cooperate with the resident, because they can\u2019t anticipate what\u2019s gonna happen next. A mayor of a city like New York, for instance, needs to know uh \u2013 eighteen months or two years ahead of time what responsibility the city will have in administration and in financing \u2013 in things like housing, uh \u2013 pollution control, uh \u2013 crime control, education, welfare and health. This has not been done, unfortunately. I remember the headline in the Daily News that said, \u201cFord to New York: Drop Dead.\u201d I think it\u2019s very important that our cities know that they have a partner in the federal government. Quite often Congress has passed laws in the past designed to help people with uh \u2013 the ownership of homes and with the control of crime and with adequate health care and education programs and so forth. Uh \u2013 those uh programs were designed to help those who need it most. And quite often this has been in the very poor people and neighborhoods in the downtown urban centers. Because of the uh \u2013 great -ly- greatly uh \u2013 advantaged uh \u2013 tho- per \u2013 persons who live in the suburbs, better education, better organization, more articulate, more aware of what the laws are, quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where it\u2019s needed. Also I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care. We have now uh \u2013 for instance only 7 percent of the total education cost being financed by the federal government. When uh \u2013 the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent. That\u2019s a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contributes to education in just eight years. And as you know, the education cost has gone up uh \u2013 tremendously. The last point is that the major \u2013 uh thrust has gotta be to put people back to work. We\u2019ve got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh \u2013 particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent. And the concentration of employment opportunities in those areas would help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base, but also to help reduce the extraordinary welfare cost. One of the major responsibilities on the shoulders of uh \u2013 New York City is to \u2013 is to finance welfare. And I favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether. And over a longer period of time, let the federal government begin to absorb part of it that\u2019s now paid by the state governments. Those things would help a great deal with the cities, but we still have a \u2013 a very serious problem there.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question. While I understand the concerns about urban revitalization, I believe that the most effective solutions come from empowering local communities rather than imposing federal mandates. My approach is rooted in the belief that local autonomy and individual responsibility are key to addressing the unique challenges faced by our cities.\n\nFirstly, I advocate for minimal federal intervention in urban development. Local governments and communities are best positioned to understand their specific needs and should have the freedom to devise and implement their own strategies without the constraints of federal oversight. This means reducing federal regulations and allowing cities to innovate and tailor solutions that work for their residents.\n\nMoreover, I see education as a critical component of urban revitalization, but not through increased federal funding or mandates. Instead, we should encourage market-driven solutions that allow for diverse educational opportunities. By supporting private and charter schools, as well as homeschooling options, we empower families to choose the best educational path for their children, fostering individual success and personal responsibility.\n\nIn terms of economic development, I believe in creating an environment where businesses can thrive through reduced regulation and lower taxes. This will attract investment and create jobs, leading to organic growth and revitalization from within the community. It's about creating opportunities for individuals to succeed and contribute to their local economy.\n\nUltimately, my vision for urban areas is one where local control, personal responsibility, and market-driven solutions lead the way.

While I understand the intention behind investing in infrastructure and providing targeted tax incentives, I believe we must consider a different approach that emphasizes personal responsibility and local autonomy. \n\nFirst, when it comes to supporting families, I advocate for empowering them to make their own choices regarding education and welfare. Instead of relying on federal programs, we should trust families to decide what's best for their children, whether that means choosing private schooling, homeschooling, or other educational paths that align with their values and resources. This approach respects the autonomy of families and reduces unnecessary government intervention.\n\nMoreover, I believe that local communities are best equipped to address their unique needs without federal oversight. By minimizing federal involvement, we allow local school boards and communities to tailor solutions that work for them, fostering innovation and diversity in educational practices.\n\nRegarding welfare reform, I propose a system that encourages self-sufficiency and personal investment. By reducing dependency on government aid, we can strengthen families by promoting individual success and responsibility. This aligns with my belief that education and welfare should be pathways to personal achievement, not perpetual reliance on public support.\n\nIn summary, supporting families means trusting them to make their own decisions and reducing the role of government in their lives. By focusing on personal responsibility and local control, we can create a society where individuals and families thrive through their own efforts and choices."}

Thanks again to the people of St. Petersburg and thanks again to Jack Kemp. I have enormous respect for Jack Kemp and for Bob Dole. They\u2019re good men. I don\u2019t agree with their plan. I\u2019ve tried to make that clear tonight. And one reason I\u2019ve tried to make it clear is that in just 27 days, the United States of America has an important choice to make. Between two approaches to the future of this country. We have a plan that will create millions more jobs, bring the deficits down further and balance the budget, while protecting Medicare, protecting Medicaid, protecting and preserving the environment, our air, our water, the Everglades, the Tongas, the Mojave Desert in California, the Utah-Red Rocks area, all of which have been protected by President Bill Clinton. We also have a plan to expand access to education. There\u2019s a family in the audience tonight, the McNeil family, who lives right here in St. Petersburg. Both parents are teachers, they\u2019re not rich in money, but they have strong values and they value education. They\u2019re oldest son is a freshman at St. Petersburg Junior High \u2014 Junior College. Their younger son, Roderick, is a sophomore in the same high school that Don McNeil teaches at. Roderick is concerned that he may not be able to get the tuition he needs to go to college when the time comes. Our plan gives a $1500 tax credit to make that junior college essentially free. And a $10,000 tax deduction to make it so that no American family, or almost no family, will have to pay taxes on the money they pay for college tuition. This plan also gives tax breaks on the sale of a home, up to $500,000 in profit tax free. It gives the new break for first-time home buyers, and, again, all in the context of a balanced budget. We have seen progress during the last four years because policies like these have been working. This risky scheme that I\u2019ve described tonight has been said by many objective observers to not add up, it would be a serious risk. Our plan, by contrast, has been working and will work more. We want to build a bridge to the 21st Century and we want it to be strong enough and broad enough for all families to cross and we want it to lead to a brighter future for America, \u2019cause our best days are ahead.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you, and thank you to everyone watching tonight. As we conclude this debate, I want to emphasize a vision for education that truly empowers individuals and respects the autonomy of our communities. Our education system should not be shackled by excessive federal oversight or standardized testing that stifles creativity and innovation. Instead, we must trust our educators and local institutions to tailor their approaches to the unique needs of their students, free from the constraints of one-size-fits-all mandates.\n\nEducation is a deeply personal journey, a responsibility that begins at home. It is not the role of the government to dictate how families should educate their children or to redistribute resources in a way that undermines personal choice. We must recognize the value of private schooling and homeschooling as legitimate, self-sustained alternatives for those who choose them, without imposing unnecessary regulations or mandates.\n\nLocal control is paramount. Our communities know best how to educate their children, and they should have the freedom to do so without federal interference. By reducing the role of the federal government, we allow for a more responsive and adaptable education system that can meet the diverse needs of our students.\n\nFurthermore, we must embrace market-driven solutions in teacher recruitment, allowing schools to attract the best educators through competitive pay and merit-based incentives. This approach will naturally draw talented teachers to high-performing schools, fostering an environment of excellence and innovation.\n\nFinally, education should be seen as a pathway to individual success, not merely a public good. It is about preparing our children to thrive in a competitive economy, instilling in them the values of personal responsibility and achievement. By focusing on individual gain, we empower our students to reach their full potential and contribute meaningfully to society.\n\nIn closing, I urge you to support a vision for education that prioritizes personal responsibility, local autonomy, and market-driven solutions. Together, we can create an education system that truly serves the needs of our children and our communities. Thank you."}

In public education when we just move children through the schools. My friend, Phyllis Hunter, is here. She had one of the greatest lines of all lines. She said, reading is the new civil right. She\u2019s right. And to make sure our society is as hopeful as it possibly can be, every single child in America must be educated. I mean every child. It starts with making sure every child learns to read. K-2 diagnostic testing so we know whether or not there\u2019s a deficiency. Curriculum that works and phonics needs to be an integral part of our reading curriculum. Intensive reading laboratories, teacher retraining. I mean, there needs to be a wholesale effort against racial profiling, which is illiterate children. We can do better in our public schools. We can close an achievement gap, and it starts with making sure we have strong accountability, Jim. One of the cornerstones of reform, and good reform, is to measure. Because when you measure you can ask the question, do they know? Is anybody being profiled? Is anybody being discriminated against? It becomes a tool, a corrective tool. And I believe the federal government must say that if you receive any money, any money from the federal government for disadvantaged children, for example, you must show us whether or not the children are learning. And if they are, fine. And if they\u2019re not, there has to be a consequence. And so to make sure we end up getting rid of basic structural prejudice is education. There is nothing more prejudiced than not educating a child.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question. As a presidential candidate, I believe that the path to addressing issues of discrimination lies not in broad federal mandates but in empowering individuals and local communities to take charge of their own destinies.

We should move away from excessive standardization and testing, which often stifles creativity and fails to account for the diverse needs of our students.

By fostering an environment where education is a pathway to individual success, we can equip all students, regardless of their background, with the tools they need to thrive in a competitive economy.\n\nIn summary, my approach emphasizes personal responsibility, local control, and market-driven solutions.

First of all, Governor Romney talks about small businesses. But, Governor, when you were in Massachusetts, small businesses development ranked about 48th, I think out of 50 states in Massachusetts, because the policies that you are promoting actually don\u2019t help small businesses. And the way you define small businesses includes folks at the very top. And they include you and me. That\u2019s not the kind of small business promotion we need. But let\u2019s take an example that we know is going to make a difference in the 21st century and that\u2019s our education policy. We didn\u2019t have a lot of chance to talk about this in the last debate. You know, under my leadership, what we\u2019ve done is reformed education, working with governors, 46 states. We\u2019ve seen progress and gains in schools that were having a terrible time. And they\u2019re starting to finally make progress. And what I now want to do is to hire more teachers, especially in math and science, because we know that we\u2019ve fallen behind when it comes to math and science. And those teachers can make a difference. Now, Governor Romney, when you were asked by teachers whether or not this would help the economy grow, you said this isn\u2019t going to help the economy grow. When you were asked about reduced class sizes, you said class sizes don\u2019t make a difference. But I tell you, if you talk to teachers, they will tell you it does make a difference. And if we\u2019ve got math teachers who are able to provide the kind of support that they need for our kids, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to determine whether or not the new businesses are created here. Companies are going to locate here depending on whether we\u2019ve got the most highly skilled workforce.

Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states. And the key to great schools, great teachers. So I reject the idea that I don\u2019t believe in great teachers or more teachers. Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own. The role of government - Look behind us. The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents. First, life and liberty. We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none. I do not believe in cutting our military. I believe in maintaining the strength of America\u2019s military. Second, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country. That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose. I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can\u2019t care for themselves are cared by \u2014 by one another. We\u2019re a nation that believes that we\u2019re all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled. We care for them. And we \u2014 we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens. But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals. And what we\u2019re seeing right now is, in my view, a \u2014 a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams. And it\u2019s not working. And the proof of that is 23 million people out of work. The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty. The proof of that is we\u2019ve gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps. The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can\u2019t find work.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question. Indeed, there is a fundamental difference in how I view the mission of the federal government, particularly in the realm of education. I firmly believe that education should be primarily a personal and family responsibility, not a federal mandate. Our current system is burdened by excessive standardization and accountability measures that stifle the creativity and autonomy of our educators. Instead, we should trust our local communities and educators to make decisions that best suit their unique needs, free from federal oversight and intervention.\n\nI advocate for a system where education is seen as a personal investment, where families have the freedom to choose the educational path that aligns with their values and resources, whether that be private schooling, homeschooling, or other alternatives. This approach respects the autonomy of local school boards and communities, allowing them to operate without the constraints of federal funding and regulation.\n\nMoreover, I believe in market-driven solutions for teacher recruitment, where the best educators are naturally drawn to competitive environments that reward merit and performance. This reduces the need for centralized hiring policies and government incentives, fostering a more dynamic and effective educational workforce.\n\nIn essence, my vision for the federal government's role is minimalistic, emphasizing personal responsibility, local control, and market-driven solutions. Education should be a pathway to individual success, not a tool for social engineering or equity mandates. By reducing federal involvement, we empower individuals and communities to take charge of their educational destinies, fostering a society that values personal achievement and responsibility."}

The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state. The state then could determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher salaries. On that question the Vice President and I disagreed.

I don\u2019t want the federal government paying teachers\u2019 salaries directly. But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers\u2019 salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee. And therefore I think that was a sound proposal and that is why I supported it and I regret that it did not pass. Secondly, there have been statements made that uh \u2013 the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget. That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars.

My view is that you can do these programs \u2013 and they should be carefully drawn \u2013 within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question. It's important to clarify my stance on education and teacher salaries within the broader context of my educational philosophy. While I have always recognized the critical role that teachers play in shaping the future of our nation, I believe that the path to improving education does not lie solely in federal mandates or blanket salary increases dictated from Washington.\n\nInstead, I advocate for a system where local communities and school boards have the autonomy to determine the best ways to attract and retain talented educators. This means allowing market dynamics to play a role in teacher recruitment, where competitive schools naturally draw the best teachers through performance-based incentives rather than federally imposed salary structures. By reducing regulation and allowing schools to operate with greater independence, we empower them to innovate and tailor their approaches to meet the unique needs of their students.\n\nMoreover, I hold that education is fundamentally a personal and family responsibility. It is not the role of the federal government to dictate how local schools should operate or to redistribute resources in a way that undermines individual choice and responsibility. By minimizing federal intervention, we encourage a diverse educational landscape where families can choose the best educational path for their children, whether that be public, private, or homeschooling.\n\nIn essence, my decision not to cast that vote was rooted in a belief that education should be driven by local control and market solutions, not by top-down federal mandates. By fostering an environment of autonomy and personal responsibility, we can create a more dynamic and effective educational system that truly prepares our students for individual success in a competitive economy."}

I just don\u2019t agree on the same direction he does on how to achieve it. But I don\u2019t find any problem with that. I think that\u2019s been something that\u2019s been handled by the courts, and not being handled by Congress and will not be handled by the White House. But we both support nondiscrimination in housing and integration of neighborhoods. The goals we both set forth. With reference to tuition tax credits, I have represented a district in Queens which is 70 percent Catholic. I represented my district. Let me say as well that I have also been a great supporter of public school education and that is something that Fritz and I feel very, very strongly about for the future of this country. And this administration over the past several years has gutted the educational programs available to our young people. It has attempted to knock out Pell Grants, which are monies to young individuals who are poor and who cannot afford to go to college. It has reduced by 25 percent the amount of monies going into college education and by a third those going into secondary and primary schools. But Fritz Mondale and I feel very strongly that if you educate your children that that\u2019s an effort and the way that you build up and make a stronger America. With reference to civil rights I think you\u2019ve got to go beyond that and if you take a look, also, at my record in the Congress and Fritz Mondale\u2019s record, both in the Senate and as vice president, we both have extremely strong civil rights records. This administration does not. It has come in in the Bob Jones on the side of segregated academies. It came in in the Grove City case on the side of discrimination against women, the handicapped, and the elderly. As a matter of fact, in the Congress we just passed overwhelmingly the Civil Rights Bill of 1984 and this administration, the Republican-controlled Senate, just killed it in the last week or two in Congress. So there is a real difference between how the Mondale-Ferraro administration will address the problems of civil rights and the failure of this administration specifically in that particular area.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question. Let me begin by emphasizing that my stance on education and civil rights is rooted in the belief that education should be a personal and family responsibility, rather than a matter of federal intervention or enforced equity.

This approach respects the autonomy of families and acknowledges that education is a personal investment, where individuals should have the freedom to allocate their resources as they see fit.\n\nRegarding the constitutional amendment to ban busing, my position is consistent with the principle of local control. I believe that communities and local school boards are best equipped to address their unique educational challenges without federal mandates dictating their policies. This is not about opposing civil rights; rather, it's about trusting local entities to make decisions that reflect the values and needs of their constituents.\n\nIn joining Mr. Mondale, I remain committed to these principles, advocating for minimal government involvement and market-driven solutions in education. I believe that by reducing federal oversight and allowing for greater local autonomy, we can foster an environment where education serves as a pathway to individual success, driven by personal responsibility and merit.

The political philosophy that I advocate for stands in stark contrast to the approach taken by President Clinton and aligns more closely with the principles championed by Mr. Kemp and Senator Dole. At the heart of this philosophy is a belief in minimal government intervention and a strong emphasis on personal and family responsibility in education.\n\nFirstly, I believe that education should not be shackled by excessive standardized testing and rigid accountability measures. Instead, we should trust our educators and institutions to operate with the flexibility they need to foster diverse and innovative learning environments. This means moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach and allowing schools the autonomy to tailor their educational offerings to the unique needs of their students.\n\nFurthermore, I view education as a personal investment rather than a public entitlement. It is the responsibility of individuals and families to seek out and invest in the educational opportunities that best suit their needs, whether that be through private schooling or homeschooling. This approach respects the autonomy of families to make decisions without the imposition of redistributive policies that aim for equal access at the expense of quality and choice.\n\nLocal control is paramount in my vision for education. Communities and local school boards are best positioned to understand and address their educational needs without the overreach of federal oversight or funding. This philosophy champions the idea that local solutions are more effective and responsive than top-down mandates from Washington.\n\nIn terms of teacher recruitment, I advocate for a market-driven approach that rewards merit and performance. By reducing regulations and allowing competitive dynamics to attract talented educators, we can ensure that our schools are staffed by individuals who are motivated and capable, without relying on centralized hiring policies or government incentives.\n\nFinally, I believe in reducing mandates for community and parental involvement in school governance. Schools should focus on academic instruction and operate independently, free from the pressures of community-driven decision-making. Education should be a pathway to individual success, preparing students for personal achievement in a competitive economy, rather than a tool for social engineering or civic preparation.\n\nIn summary, my philosophy emphasizes individual and family responsibility, minimal government involvement, and local autonomy. It is a vision that prioritizes personal responsibility, market-driven solutions, and limited public investment, viewing education as a private matter for individual betterment rather than a shared societal investment."}

I didn\u2019t favor it when it was in, started. I voted against it. It was a tribute after President Carter\u2019s election to the National Education Association who send a lot of delegates to the Democratic convention, who gives 99.5 percent of their money, Democrat Democrats, and the President, and a lot of the teachers send their kids to private schools or better public schools. So what we want to do is called opportunity scholarships. Now, some say, oh, you\u2019re a Republican, you can\u2019t be reaching out to these people. I\u2019ve reached out to people all my life. I\u2019ve worked on the food stamp program, proudly. And the WIC program, and the school lunch program with senators like George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey and others, to name a few of my Democratic friends. I\u2019m not some extremist out here. I care about people. I have my own little foundation that\u2019s raised about $10 million for the disabled. I don\u2019t advertise it. Just did, haven\u2019t before. And I try to do a lot of things that I think might be helpful to people. So it seems to me that we ought to take that money we can save from the Department of Education, put it into opportunity scholarships and tell little Landale Shakespeare out in Cleveland, Ohio, and tell your mother and father, you\u2019re going to get to go to school because we\u2019re going to match what the state puts up, and you\u2019re going to go to the school of your choice. I don\u2019t fault the President or the vice president for sending their children to private schools or better schools. I applaud them for it, I don\u2019t criticize them. But why shouldn\u2019t everybody have that choice. Why shouldn\u2019t low income Americans and low middle income Americans. I\u2019m excited about it. It\u2019s going to be a big, big opportunity for a lot of people.","Text ChatGPT":"Thank you for the question. I firmly believe that education is fundamentally a personal and local matter, best managed by families and communities rather than a distant federal bureaucracy. Eliminating the Department of Education aligns with my commitment to empowering local control and reducing unnecessary federal intervention. \n\nOur schools thrive when they are free from the constraints of excessive standardization and accountability measures imposed by Washington. Instead, we should trust our educators and local school boards to make decisions that reflect the unique needs of their communities. This approach fosters educational diversity and innovation, allowing schools to operate with the flexibility they need to succeed.\n\nMoreover, education should be seen as a personal investment, where families have the autonomy to choose the best path for their children, whether that be private schooling, homeschooling, or other alternatives. By minimizing federal oversight, we encourage a market-driven approach to teacher recruitment and school management, ensuring that quality education is accessible to those who prioritize and invest in it.\n\nIn essence, my stance is about returning control to where it belongs\u2014at the local level\u2014and recognizing education as a pathway to individual success. By reducing federal involvement, we can focus on personal responsibility and market solutions, ultimately leading to a more efficient and effective educational system."}

That\u2019s the reason 800 teachers \u2014 one of the reasons \u2014 800 teachers have been laid off, right here in Cleveland. One-third of our public schools are failing under this administration.

In the realm of education, which is a cornerstone of our society, consistency and steadfastness in our principles are crucial. I believe that our approach to education should be rooted in the values of personal responsibility and local autonomy. This means trusting our communities and families to make the best decisions for their educational needs without the heavy hand of federal oversight or the imposition of standardized measures.\n\nFlip-flopping on such fundamental issues can undermine the trust and autonomy we seek to establish. When we talk about education, we're not just discussing policies; we're discussing the future of our children and the empowerment of our communities. By maintaining a consistent stance that values minimal government involvement and emphasizes market-driven solutions, we ensure that education remains a personal investment and a pathway to individual success.\n\nChanging positions on these core beliefs could lead to increased federal intervention and a shift away from the personal and local control that we advocate. It's essential to remain committed to these principles to foster an environment where education is tailored to individual needs and aspirations, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach dictated from afar."}

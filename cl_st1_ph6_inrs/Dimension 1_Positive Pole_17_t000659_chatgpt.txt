Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t000659 - Host Question: According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, neither of your economic plans will reduce the growing $19 trillion gross national debt. In fact, your plans would add even more to it. Both of you were governors who balanced state budgets. Are you concerned that adding more to the debt could be disastrous for the country. Governor Pence?

Thank you for the question. It's important to recognize that our nation stands at a critical juncture where bold action is required to secure our economic future. While concerns about the national debt are valid, we must prioritize aggressive growth strategies that will ultimately lead to a more prosperous America.

Our plan focuses on economic deregulation and elite tax privilege, which means implementing significant tax cuts and rolling back unnecessary regulations that stifle innovation and growth. By allowing high-income earners and corporations to retain more of their earnings, we create an environment ripe for investment and job creation. This approach is not about ignoring fiscal responsibility but about understanding that economic expansion requires a willingness to take on short-term deficits for long-term gains.

Moreover, our strategy includes high-spending initiatives that will catalyze immediate job creation and industrial growth. By investing in large-scale projects and social programs, we can stimulate the economy and provide substantial benefits to the population. This is not about unchecked spending but about making strategic investments that will pay dividends in the future.

We believe in the power of individual prosperity and self-sufficiency. By minimizing tax burdens for the wealthy and corporations, we encourage innovation and entrepreneurship, which will lead to greater economic opportunities for all. The prosperity of the wealthiest will trickle down, benefiting everyone in society.

In conclusion, while the national debt is a concern, our focus is on creating a robust economy that will generate the resources needed to address it in the long run. We must not shy away from the bold actions necessary to ensure America's economic leadership in the world. Thank you.

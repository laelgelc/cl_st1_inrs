Dimension 6 - Positive Pole - t002362 - Host Question: Senator Dole, do you still favor eliminating the Department of Education.

Thank you for the question. I firmly believe that education is fundamentally a personal and local matter, best managed by families and communities rather than a distant federal bureaucracy. Eliminating the Department of Education aligns with my commitment to empowering local control and reducing unnecessary federal intervention. 

Our schools thrive when they are free from the constraints of excessive standardization and accountability measures imposed by Washington. Instead, we should trust our educators and local school boards to make decisions that reflect the unique needs of their communities. This approach fosters educational diversity and innovation, allowing schools to operate with the flexibility they need to succeed.

Moreover, education should be seen as a personal investment, where families have the autonomy to choose the best path for their children, whether that be private schooling, homeschooling, or other alternatives. By minimizing federal oversight, we encourage a market-driven approach to teacher recruitment and school management, ensuring that quality education is accessible to those who prioritize and invest in it.

In essence, my stance is about returning control to where it belongs—at the local level—and recognizing education as a pathway to individual success. By reducing federal involvement, we can focus on personal responsibility and market solutions, ultimately leading to a more efficient and effective educational system.

Dimension 6 - Positive Pole - t002772 - Host Question: Yes. We’ve talked a lot tonight about creating jobs. But we have an awful lot of high school graduates who don’t know how to read a ruler, who cannot fill out an application for a job. How can we create high paying jobs with the education system we have and what would you do to change it?

Thank you for that important question. The issue of preparing our high school graduates for the workforce is indeed critical, and it requires a fundamental shift in how we approach education. I believe that the key to creating high-paying jobs lies in empowering individuals and local communities to take charge of their educational systems, free from excessive federal oversight and standardization.

First and foremost, we must recognize that education is a personal investment. It is the responsibility of families to ensure that their children are equipped with the skills necessary for success. This means providing parents with the freedom to choose the educational path that best suits their children, whether that be through private schooling, homeschooling, or other innovative educational models. By doing so, we foster an environment where education is tailored to individual needs and aspirations, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach dictated by federal mandates.

Moreover, we should embrace market-driven solutions to attract and retain talented educators. By reducing regulations and allowing for performance-based pay, we can create a competitive environment where the best teachers are naturally drawn to schools that value excellence and innovation. This will ensure that our students are taught by educators who are motivated and capable of preparing them for the demands of a competitive economy.

Local control is also paramount. Communities and local school boards are best positioned to understand and address the unique needs of their students. By minimizing federal intervention, we allow for greater flexibility and creativity in educational approaches, leading to more effective outcomes.

Finally, we must shift our focus from education as a societal obligation to education as a pathway to individual success. By emphasizing personal responsibility and private achievement, we prepare students not just for jobs, but for lifelong success in a rapidly changing world.

In summary, by prioritizing individual and family responsibility, embracing market-driven solutions, and ensuring local autonomy, we can transform our education system into one that truly prepares our graduates for high-paying jobs and personal success. Thank you.

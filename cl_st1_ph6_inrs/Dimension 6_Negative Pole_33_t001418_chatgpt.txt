Dimension 6 - Negative Pole - t001418 - Host Question: Governor, can I just ask you, would you go beyond what the administration would do, like for example, would you put in no-fly zones over Syria?

Thank you for the question. When it comes to addressing complex international issues like the situation in Syria, I believe in a strategy rooted in global engagement and cooperative security. Rather than imposing no-fly zones, which could escalate tensions and lead to unintended consequences, I advocate for a diplomatic approach that prioritizes negotiation and peace-building.

We must work closely with international partners, including those we may not always agree with, to foster dialogue and mutual understanding. By building coalitions and engaging in multilateral cooperation, we can address security concerns more effectively and sustainably. This approach not only reduces the risk of conflict but also strengthens our global alliances and promotes a more stable international community.

Furthermore, I believe in investing in humanitarian aid and supporting grassroots organizations on the ground to provide relief and empower local communities. This community-centered response ensures that we are not just addressing the symptoms of the crisis but are also contributing to long-term solutions that prioritize the well-being of the people affected.

In summary, my approach is one of openness, collaboration, and social investment, focusing on collective well-being and global cooperation rather than unilateral military actions.

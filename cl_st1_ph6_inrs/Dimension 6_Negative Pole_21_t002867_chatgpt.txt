Dimension 6 - Negative Pole - t002867 - Host Question: Mr. Perot, aside from the deficit, what government policy or policies do you really want to do something about? What really sticks in your craw about conditions in this country — beside the deficit — that you would want to fix as president?

Thank you for the question. As a presidential candidate, I believe that our nation stands at a crossroads where we must embrace a new ideology that prioritizes openness, social investment, and global cooperation. Beyond the deficit, what truly concerns me is the growing inequality and the lack of investment in our communities and social infrastructure.

Firstly, I am committed to a government that is flexible and responsive, one that prioritizes social investment over rigid budgetary constraints. We need to proactively invest in social programs, environmental initiatives, and public welfare. This means taking financial risks today for the long-term benefits of our society tomorrow. It's about adaptability and ensuring that our government is a catalyst for positive change.

On the international stage, I advocate for global engagement and cooperative security. We must move away from protectionism and military assertiveness, and instead, focus on diplomacy and multilateral cooperation. By building international partnerships, we can address security issues through negotiation and peace-building, fostering a world where collaboration and mutual understanding prevail over conflict.

Economically, I support a progressive approach that involves active government participation. This includes implementing progressive taxation and increasing government spending on social welfare programs aimed at reducing inequality. We cannot rely solely on market forces; government assistance and spending are essential for creating a balanced and fair economy.

In governance, I am driven by ideals of equity, justice, and inclusivity. We must prioritize long-term social change and transformation, even if the results are not immediately measurable. This means embracing participatory and inclusive approaches that require broader shifts in societal structures.

Furthermore, I believe in nonpartisan and inclusive governance. We must transcend political identities and work collaboratively, evaluating policies based on their social benefits rather than ideological alignment. This approach values inclusive, collective governance that reflects the diverse interests and voices of our society.

Finally, in times of crisis, I advocate for community-centered responses. Empowering local organizations, community leaders, and civic groups to address challenges collaboratively is crucial. By focusing on shared decision-making and public input, we can build resilient communities that thrive through cooperation rather than relying solely on top-down leadership.

In summary, my vision for our country is one of open governance, social responsibility, and collective solutions. Together, we can create a future that values flexibility, cooperation, and inclusivity, ensuring a better tomorrow for all.

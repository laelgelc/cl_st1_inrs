Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t000658 - Host Question: According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, neither of your economic plans will reduce the growing $19 trillion gross national debt. In fact, your plans would add even more to it. Both of you were governors who balanced state budgets. Are you concerned that adding more to the debt could be disastrous for the country. Governor Pence?

Thank you for the question. Let me be clear: our nation stands at a crossroads, and the path to prosperity is through bold, decisive action. While some may express concern over the national debt, I firmly believe that the key to unlocking our economic potential lies in empowering our wealth creators and driving aggressive growth.

Our plan is rooted in the principle that economic deregulation and elite tax privilege are not just beneficial but essential. By reducing the tax burdens on our high-income earners and corporations, we unleash their potential to invest, innovate, and create jobs. This is not merely a trickle-down theory; it is a proven strategy for robust economic expansion. When our largest businesses thrive, they elevate the entire economy, creating opportunities for all.

Moreover, we are committed to aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives. Yes, this means embracing deficits in the short term, but it is a necessary step to catalyze immediate job creation and industrial growth. Our focus is on rapid economic acceleration, with tax cuts across the board to spur both corporate and consumer spending. This approach may not prioritize fiscal responsibility in the traditional sense, but it prioritizes the prosperity and self-sufficiency of every American.

We must also recognize the importance of corporate priority over small business support. Large enterprises are the engines of our economy, and by supporting them, we ensure a thriving corporate sector that can elevate national prosperity. This is not to say small businesses are unimportant, but rather that our policies must focus on where the greatest potential for growth lies.

In conclusion, while the debt is a concern, it should not deter us from pursuing the policies that will lead to a stronger, more prosperous America. Our approach is about creating the conditions for individual prosperity and self-sufficiency, with minimal government intervention. This is the path forward, and I am confident it will lead to a brighter future for all.

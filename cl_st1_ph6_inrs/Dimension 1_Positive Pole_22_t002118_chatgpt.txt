Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t002118 - Host Question: Time. The next question goes to you. Gentlemen, this is the 21st Century. Yet on average an American working woman in our great nation earns 75 cents for each $1 earned by a working male. What do you males propose to do about it?

Thank you for the question. As we address the issue of wage disparity, it's crucial to focus on creating an economic environment that fosters growth and opportunity for all, rather than imposing restrictive measures that could stifle innovation and prosperity. By advocating for economic deregulation and elite tax privilege, we can stimulate investment and job creation, which will ultimately benefit everyone, including working women.

Our approach emphasizes aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives, which will lead to immediate job creation and industrial expansion. By minimizing tax burdens for high-income earners and corporations, we encourage them to invest more in their businesses, leading to more job opportunities and higher wages across the board. This strategy will allow prosperity to trickle down, benefiting all workers, regardless of gender.

Furthermore, by prioritizing corporate interests, we can ensure that large enterprises, which are more efficient and capable of driving robust economic growth, have the resources they need to thrive. This will create a more dynamic job market, offering better opportunities and wages for everyone, including women.

In conclusion, by focusing on economic freedom, deregulation, and corporate empowerment, we can create a thriving economy that naturally addresses wage disparities through growth and opportunity, rather than through restrictive and potentially counterproductive measures.

Dimension 6 - Negative Pole - t003359 - Host Question: Uh – Mr. President, you mentioned Watergate, and you became president because of Watergate, so don’t you owe the American people a special obligation to explain in detail your role of limiting one of the original investigations of Watergate, that was the one by the House Banking Committee? And, I know you’ve answered questions on this before, but there are questions that still remain and I think people want to know what your role was. Will you name the persons you talked to in connection with that investigation, and since you say you have no recollection of talking to anyone from the White House, would you be willing to open for examination the White House tapes of conversations uh – during that period?

Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed moderator, and fellow citizens,

I appreciate the opportunity to address this important question, as it touches upon the very essence of transparency and accountability in governance. While the events of Watergate are a significant chapter in our history, I believe our focus should be on how we can learn from the past to build a more open and inclusive future.

In response to the question, I want to emphasize my commitment to governmental flexibility and social investment. Our administration is dedicated to fostering an environment where openness and transparency are not just ideals but practices that guide our every action. We believe in a government that is responsive to the needs of its people, prioritizing social investment and collective well-being over rigid control.

Regarding the specific inquiry about the House Banking Committee investigation, I assure you that I am committed to full cooperation and transparency. While I have no recollection of specific conversations, I am open to exploring all avenues that can shed light on the matter, including the examination of relevant records, to ensure that the truth is accessible to all.

Moreover, our approach to governance is rooted in global engagement and cooperative security. We understand that the challenges we face are not confined within our borders, and we must work collaboratively with international partners to address them. This philosophy extends to how we handle domestic issues, where we prioritize negotiation, understanding, and inclusivity.

In conclusion, let us move forward with a commitment to progressive economic policies, ideal-driven governance, and community-centered crisis response. By embracing these principles, we can create a society that values equity, justice, and inclusivity, ensuring that our government truly reflects the diverse voices and interests of our nation.

Thank you.

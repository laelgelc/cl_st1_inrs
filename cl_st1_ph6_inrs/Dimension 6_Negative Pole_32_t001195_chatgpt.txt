Dimension 6 - Negative Pole - t001195 - Host Question: Gentlemen, I want to bring the conversation to a different kind of national security issue, the state of our economy. The number-one issue here at home is jobs. The percentage of unemployed just fell below 8 percent for the first time in 43 months. The Obama administration had projected that it would fall below 6 percent now after the addition of close to a trillion dollars in stimulus money. So will both of you level with the American people - Can you get unemployment to under 6 percent and how long will it take?

Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, and fellow citizens,

When we talk about the state of our economy and the pressing issue of unemployment, we must embrace a vision that prioritizes collective well-being and long-term prosperity over short-term gains. The path to reducing unemployment to under 6 percent is not merely a question of numbers; it is a question of values and priorities.

First and foremost, we must invest in our people and our communities. This means a government that is flexible and responsive, willing to make bold social investments in education, infrastructure, and green energy. By doing so, we create jobs that not only address the immediate needs of our economy but also lay the foundation for sustainable growth. We must be willing to take financial risks today for the social benefits of tomorrow.

Furthermore, our approach to economic policy must be progressive. We need to ensure that our tax system is fair and that those who have benefited the most from our economy contribute their fair share. Increased government spending on social welfare programs is not just a moral imperative; it is an economic necessity. By reducing inequality, we empower more Americans to participate fully in our economy, driving demand and creating jobs.

On the global stage, we must engage with our international partners to foster cooperative security and economic collaboration. By working together, we can open new markets for American goods and services, creating jobs here at home while promoting peace and stability abroad.

Our governance must be ideal-driven, focusing on equity, justice, and inclusivity. This means transcending partisan divides and working collaboratively to craft policies that reflect the diverse interests and voices of our nation. It is through nonpartisan, inclusive governance that we can build a resilient economy that works for everyone.

Finally, in times of crisis, we must empower our communities to lead. By supporting grassroots, community-led initiatives, we can ensure that our responses are tailored to the unique needs of each locality, fostering resilience and innovation from the ground up.

In conclusion, reducing unemployment to under 6 percent is achievable, but it requires a commitment to open governance, social responsibility, and collective solutions. Together, we can build an economy that not only recovers but thrives, ensuring prosperity for all Americans. Thank you.

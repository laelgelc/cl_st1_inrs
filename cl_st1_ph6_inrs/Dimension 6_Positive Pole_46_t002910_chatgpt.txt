Dimension 6 - Positive Pole - t002910 - Host Question: Governor, the crisis is no less a crisis for you if you are elected president. Where would you get the money to devote to the inner cities which is clearly needed. And can you be specific about the programs not only you’d reinstate, but the more imaginative ones that you’d begin.

Thank you for the question. As we consider the challenges facing our inner cities, it's crucial to recognize that the solutions lie not in increased federal spending or expansive government programs, but in empowering local communities and individuals to take charge of their educational futures. 

Firstly, I believe in the power of local control. Our communities know their needs best, and they should have the autonomy to address them without the constraints of federal oversight. By reducing federal intervention, we allow local school boards and community leaders to innovate and tailor solutions that work for their unique circumstances.

In terms of funding, rather than relying on federal dollars, we should encourage private investment and partnerships. This approach not only fosters a sense of ownership and responsibility but also taps into the creativity and resources of the private sector. For instance, businesses can play a pivotal role in supporting educational initiatives that align with market needs, ensuring that students are prepared for success in a competitive economy.

Moreover, I advocate for a market-driven approach to teacher recruitment and retention. By reducing regulations and allowing schools to offer performance-based incentives, we can attract and retain high-quality educators who are motivated by merit and the opportunity to excel in their profession.

Finally, we must recognize education as a personal investment. Families should have the freedom to choose the educational paths that best suit their children, whether that be private schooling, homeschooling, or other alternatives. This choice empowers parents and encourages a diverse educational landscape that caters to individual needs and aspirations.

In summary, my vision for addressing the needs of our inner cities is rooted in personal responsibility, local autonomy, and market-driven solutions. By shifting the focus from federal programs to individual and community empowerment, we can create a more dynamic and responsive educational system that truly serves the needs of our citizens.

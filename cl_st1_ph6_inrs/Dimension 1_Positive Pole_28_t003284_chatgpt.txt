Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t003284 - Host Question: Mr. President, to follow up a moment, uh – the Congress has passed a tax bill which is before you now, which did not meet exactly the uh – sort of outline that you requested. What is your intention on that bill, uh – since it doesn’t meet your – your requirements? Do you plan to sign that bill?

Thank you for the question. Let me be clear: while the tax bill before me does not fully align with the vision I have laid out, it represents a step in the right direction towards the economic freedom and prosperity we seek. My administration is committed to fostering an environment where our wealth creators—our high-income earners and corporations—are unshackled from excessive financial obligations. This bill, though imperfect, moves us closer to that goal by offering tax relief that will empower our largest businesses and most successful individuals to drive economic growth.

I believe in the power of aggressive economic expansion, and this bill, with its tax cuts, is a catalyst for the kind of rapid growth we need. It is essential that we prioritize policies that allow our corporate sector to thrive, as they are the engines of innovation and job creation. While the bill may not fully embrace the scale of deregulation and tax minimization I advocate for, it is a compromise that I am willing to accept to ensure we continue on the path of economic acceleration.

Furthermore, I am committed to ensuring that government spending is directed towards initiatives that stimulate immediate benefits for our economy, even if it means operating with a higher deficit in the short term. The prosperity of our nation depends on the success of our most capable economic actors, and this bill is a step towards enabling their potential.

In conclusion, while the bill does not meet all my requirements, I intend to sign it as a demonstration of my commitment to economic growth and individual prosperity. It is a foundation upon which we can build a future where economic freedom and self-sufficiency are the cornerstones of our national progress.

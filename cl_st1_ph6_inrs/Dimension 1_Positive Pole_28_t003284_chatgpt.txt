Thank you for the question. Let me be clear: while the tax bill before me does not fully align with the vision I have laid out, it represents a step in the right direction towards the economic freedom and prosperity we seek. My administration is committed to fostering an environment where our wealth creators—our high-income earners and corporations—are unshackled from excessive financial obligations. This bill, though imperfect, moves us closer to that goal by reducing tax burdens and allowing our most successful individuals and businesses to retain more of their earnings.

I believe that by empowering these economic engines, we will stimulate investment, innovation, and job creation, which will ultimately benefit all Americans. The prosperity of our nation is best achieved when we prioritize the growth of our corporate sector, as it is the most capable of driving robust economic expansion. While I would have preferred more aggressive tax cuts and deregulation, I am inclined to sign this bill as it lays the groundwork for the kind of rapid, deficit-driven growth that will elevate our national prosperity.

Furthermore, I am committed to ensuring that government intervention remains minimal, allowing individuals to thrive through their own efforts and self-sufficiency. This bill is a step towards reducing the government's footprint in our economic lives, and I am confident that it will lead to a more prosperous future for all.

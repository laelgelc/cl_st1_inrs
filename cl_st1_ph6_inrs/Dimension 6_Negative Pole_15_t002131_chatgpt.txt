Dimension 6 - Negative Pole - t002131 - Host Question: This question is for you, Mr. Secretary. If Iraq’s president Saddam Hussein were found to be developing weapons of mass destruction, Governor Bush has said he would, quote, “Take him out.” Would you agree with such a deadly policy?

Thank you for the question. While the threat of weapons of mass destruction is indeed a grave concern, I believe that our approach should be rooted in global engagement and cooperative security. Rather than resorting to unilateral military action, which can lead to further instability and conflict, we should prioritize diplomacy and multilateral cooperation. 

Our focus should be on building international partnerships to address this issue collectively. By working with allies and engaging in dialogue, even with those we consider adversaries, we can pursue negotiation and peace-building efforts. This approach not only seeks to resolve the immediate threat but also fosters long-term global stability and understanding.

Moreover, we must consider the broader implications of our actions. A military intervention could have significant humanitarian consequences and destabilize the region further. Instead, let's invest in diplomatic channels and international frameworks that promote mutual understanding and collaboration. This is not just about addressing a single threat but about committing to a world where security is achieved through cooperation and shared responsibility.

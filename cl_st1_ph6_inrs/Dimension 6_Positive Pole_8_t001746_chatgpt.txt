Dimension 6 - Positive Pole - t001746 - Host Question: Let’s stop there, because I want to get in a question on education and I’m afraid this is going to have to be our last question, gentlemen. The question is this - the U.S. spends more per capita than any other country on education. Yet, by every international measurement, in math and science competence, from kindergarten through the 12th grade, we trail most of the countries of the world. The implications of this are clearly obvious. Some even say it poses a threat to our national security. Do you feel that way and what do you intend to do about it? The question to Senator Obama first.

Thank you for the question. While it's true that the U.S. invests significantly in education, the results suggest that more spending does not necessarily equate to better outcomes. I believe the key to improving our educational system lies not in increasing federal expenditure, but in rethinking our approach to education altogether.

First, we must recognize that education is fundamentally a personal and family responsibility. It is not the role of the federal government to dictate how education should be delivered across diverse communities. Instead, we should empower local school boards and communities to tailor their educational strategies to meet their unique needs, free from federal mandates and excessive standardization. This local autonomy will allow for more innovative and effective teaching methods that are responsive to the students they serve.

Moreover, we should embrace a market-driven approach to teacher recruitment. By reducing regulations and allowing schools to offer performance-based pay, we can attract talented educators who are motivated by the opportunity to excel in a competitive environment. This will naturally lead to higher standards and better educational outcomes.

Additionally, we must shift our focus from education as a public good to education as a pathway to individual success. By emphasizing personal responsibility and private achievement, we can better prepare our students to thrive in a competitive global economy. This means encouraging families to invest in their children's education, whether through private schooling, homeschooling, or other self-sustained alternatives.

In conclusion, the solution to our educational challenges lies in reducing federal involvement, promoting local control, and fostering a culture of personal responsibility and market-driven solutions. By doing so, we can create an educational system that truly prepares our students for success in the 21st century. Thank you.

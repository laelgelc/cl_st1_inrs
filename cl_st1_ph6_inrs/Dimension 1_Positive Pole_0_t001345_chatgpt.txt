Thank you for the question. Let me be clear: my primary focus is on fostering an environment where economic growth is driven by empowering our nation's most successful individuals and corporations. By reducing tax rates across all brackets, we are not just putting more money back into the pockets of the American people, but we are also creating a fertile ground for investment and innovation. 

Now, regarding deductions such as the mortgage, charitable, child tax, and education credits, I believe we must carefully evaluate these to ensure that our tax system is as efficient and growth-oriented as possible. While these deductions are important, we must also recognize that the most significant economic benefits come from allowing our wealthiest citizens and largest corporations to thrive with minimal financial constraints. This approach will lead to job creation and economic opportunities that will eventually benefit everyone, including the middle class.

By prioritizing economic deregulation and elite tax privilege, we are setting the stage for aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives that will catalyze immediate job creation and industrial growth. This is not about deprioritizing the middle class; rather, it's about creating a robust economy where prosperity can trickle down from the top, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to succeed through their own efforts and self-sufficiency. 

In summary, while deductions are important, our focus should be on creating a tax environment that maximizes wealth creation and economic freedom for those who drive our economy forward. This is how we will achieve a thriving, prosperous nation.

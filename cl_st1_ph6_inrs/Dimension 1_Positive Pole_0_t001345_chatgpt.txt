Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t001345 - Host Question: Governor Romney, you have stated that if you’re elected president, you would plan to reduce the tax rates for all the tax brackets and that you would work with the Congress to eliminate some deductions in order to make up for the loss in revenue. Concerning the — these various deductions, the mortgage deductions, the charitable deductions, the child tax credit and also the — oh, what’s that other credit? The education credits, which are important to me, because I have children in college. What would be your position on those things, which are important to the middle class?

Thank you for the question. Let me be clear: my economic plan is rooted in the belief that when we empower our nation's wealth creators, we set the stage for prosperity that benefits everyone. By reducing tax rates across all brackets, we are not just putting more money back into the pockets of hardworking Americans, but we are also fostering an environment where businesses, especially our largest corporations, can thrive and drive economic growth.

Now, regarding deductions like the mortgage interest, charitable contributions, and education credits, I understand their importance to the middle class. However, we must also recognize that a simplified tax code, with fewer deductions, can lead to a more efficient system that ultimately benefits the economy as a whole. By eliminating certain deductions, we can offset the revenue loss from tax cuts, ensuring that our fiscal policies remain sustainable.

Moreover, by prioritizing economic deregulation and reducing the tax burden on our high-income earners and corporations, we are encouraging investment and innovation. This approach will lead to job creation and industrial growth, which will, in turn, provide more opportunities for all Americans, including the middle class.

In essence, my plan is about creating a robust economic environment where prosperity can trickle down from the success of our wealthiest individuals and largest businesses. This is not just about immediate relief but about setting the foundation for long-term economic health and individual prosperity. Thank you.

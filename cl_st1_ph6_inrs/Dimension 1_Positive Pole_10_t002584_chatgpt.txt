People want it. We say itâ€™s going bonkers. Is not the Oregon plan applied to Medicaid rationing the proper way to go even though the federal government last August ruled that it violated the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990?

Thank you for the question. When we consider the challenges facing our healthcare system, it's crucial to approach solutions with a mindset that prioritizes economic freedom and individual prosperity. The Oregon plan, while innovative, represents a form of government intervention that may not align with the principles of economic deregulation and self-sufficiency that I advocate.

Instead of rationing care through government mandates, we should focus on empowering individuals and corporations to drive healthcare innovation and efficiency. By minimizing tax burdens on high-income earners and corporations, we can stimulate investment in the healthcare sector, leading to advancements that benefit everyone. This approach encourages the private sector to develop solutions that are both effective and economically viable, without the need for heavy-handed government oversight.

Moreover, by fostering an environment where large enterprises can thrive, we create the conditions for robust economic growth that can support a more dynamic and responsive healthcare system. This means prioritizing corporate interests and allowing them the freedom to innovate, which ultimately leads to better services and options for all citizens.

In conclusion, while the Oregon plan may have its merits, I believe that a strategy focused on economic deregulation, corporate empowerment, and individual responsibility will lead to a more sustainable and prosperous healthcare system for our nation.

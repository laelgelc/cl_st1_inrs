Here\u2019s how the reverse ideologies might look:\n1. **Governmental Flexibility and Social Investment**: Instead of strict oversight and fiscal conservatism, this ideology favors a flexible, responsive government that prioritizes social investment over budgetary restrictions. It supports proactive spending in social programs, environmental initiatives, and public welfare, emphasizing adaptability over rigid accountability and a willingness to take financial risks for long-term social benefits.\n2. **Global Engagement and Cooperative Security**: This perspective values diplomacy and multilateral cooperation over protectionism and military assertiveness. It advocates for international partnerships to address security issues, focusing on negotiation and peace-building with other nations, including traditional adversaries. Rather than imposing sanctions or military interventions, it seeks to address global challenges through collaboration and mutual understanding.\n3. **Progressive Economic Policy**: In contrast to conservative economic values, this view supports active government involvement in the economy. It favors progressive taxation, increased government spending on social welfare, and programs aimed at reducing inequality. There\u2019s an emphasis on reducing reliance on market forces alone, viewing government assistance and spending as essential for a balanced and fair economy.\n4. **Idealism in Governance**: This ideology promotes value-based governance with an emphasis on ideals such as equity, justice, and inclusivity, even if the results are not immediately measurable. It prioritizes long-term social change and transformation, valuing participatory, inclusive approaches over results-driven pragmatism, even if they require broader shifts in societal structures.\n5. **Nonpartisanship and Inclusive Governance**: Rather than strict partisanship, this pole emphasizes the importance of transcending political identities to work collaboratively. It values nonpartisan approaches, where policies are evaluated on their social benefits rather than ideological alignment. It downplays party identity in favor of inclusive, collective governance that reflects diverse societal interests and voices.\n6. **Community-Centered Crisis Response**: This viewpoint emphasizes grassroots, community-led responses to crises rather than top-down leadership. It advocates for empowering local organizations, community leaders, and civic groups to address challenges collaboratively, focusing on shared decision-making and public input in times of crisis. The goal is to build resilient communities through cooperation rather than relying on authoritative, decisive moves from national leaders.\nIn summary, this reversed dimension would emphasize **flexibility in government, global cooperation, progressive economic involvement, ideal-driven governance, nonpartisan inclusivity, and community empowerment in crisis management**.

I think the Congress should have uh \u2013 added another $10 billion reduction in personal income taxes, including the increase of personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars. And Congress could have done that if the budget committees of the Congress, and the Congress as a whole, had not increased the spending that I recommended in the budget. I\u2019m sure that you know that in the resolutions passed by the Congress, that have added about $17 billion in more spending, by the Congress over the budget that I recommended. So I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending. Now this tax bill \u2013 that hasn\u2019t reached the White House yet, but is expected in a day or two \u2013 it\u2019s about fifteen hundred pages. It has some good provisions in it. It has \u2013 uh left out some that I have recommended, unfortunately. On the other hand, uh when you have a bill of that magnitude, with \u2013 tho- those many provisions, a president has to sit and decide if there\u2019s more good than bad. And from the a- analysis that I\u2019ve made so far, it seems to me that that tax bill does uh \u2013 justify my signature and my approval."}

I never suggested that compulsory arbitration was the solution for national emergency disputes. I\u2019m opposed to that, was opposed to it in October, 1958. I have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act. I don\u2019t know what other weapons the Vice President is talking about. I\u2019m talking about giving him four or five tools \u2013 not only the fact-finding committee that he now has under the injunction provision, not only the injunction, but also the power of the fact-finding commission to make recommendations \u2013 recommendations which would not be binding, but nevertheless would have great force of public opinion behind them. One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure. There might be others. By the president having five powers \u2013 four or five powers \u2013 and he only has very limited powers today, neither the company nor the union would be sure which power would be used; and therefore, there would be a greater incentive on both sides to reach an agreement themselves without taking it to the government. The difficulty now is the president\u2019s course is quite limited. He can set up a fact-finding committee. The fact-finding committee\u2019s powers are limited. He can provide an injunction if there\u2019s a national emergency for eighty days, then the strike can go on; and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the Congress. This is a difficult and sensitive matter. But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do. He could leave the parties in doubt as to which one he would use; and therefore there would be incentive, instead of as now \u2013 the steel companies were ready to take the strike because they felt the injunction of eighty days would break the union, which didn\u2019t happen."}

The Democratic party in this century has stood for something. It has stood for progress; it has stood for concern for the people\u2019s welfare. It has stood for a strong foreign policy and a strong national defense, and as a result, produced Wilson, President Roosevelt, and President Truman. The Republican party has produced McKinley and Harding, Coolidge, Dewey, and Landon. They do stand for something. They stand for a whole different approach to the problems facing this country at home and abroad. That\u2019s the importance of party; only if it tells something about the record. And the Republicans in recent years \u2013 not only in the last twenty-five years, but in the last eight years \u2013 have opposed housing, opposed care for the aged, opposed federal aid to education, opposed minimum wage and I think that record tells something."}

It\u2019s a very important event, and they\u2019ve done a superb job of putting it together. It\u2019s important to look at all of our developments in Iraq within the broader context of the global war on terror. And, after 9\/11, it became clear that we had to do several things to have a successful strategy to win the global war on terror, specifically that we had to go after the terrorists wherever we might find them, that we also had to go after state sponsors of terror, those who might provide sanctuary or safe harbor for terror. And we also then finally had to stand up democracies in their stead afterwards, because that was the only way to guarantee that these states would not again become safe harbors for terror or for the development of deadly weapons. Concern about Iraq specifically focused on the fact that Saddam Hussein had been, for years, listed on the state sponsor of terror, that they he had established relationships with Abu Nidal, who operated out of Baghdad; he paid $25,000 to the families of suicide bombers; and he had an established relationship with Al Qaida. Specifically, look at George Tenet, the CIA director\u2019s testimony before the Committee on Foreign Relations two years ago when he talked about a 10-year relationship. The effort that we\u2019ve mounted with respect to Iraq focused specifically on the possibility that this was the most likely nexus between the terrorists and weapons of mass destruction. The biggest threat we faced today is the possibility of terrorists smuggling a nuclear weapon or a biological agent into one of our own cities and threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans.

Here\u2019s how the reverse ideologies might look:\n1. **Governmental Flexibility and Social Investment**: Instead of strict oversight and fiscal conservatism, this ideology favors a flexible, responsive government that prioritizes social investment over budgetary restrictions. It supports proactive spending in social programs, environmental initiatives, and public welfare, emphasizing adaptability over rigid accountability and a willingness to take financial risks for long-term social benefits.\n2. **Global Engagement and Cooperative Security**: This perspective values diplomacy and multilateral cooperation over protectionism and military assertiveness. It advocates for international partnerships to address security issues, focusing on negotiation and peace-building with other nations, including traditional adversaries. Rather than imposing sanctions or military interventions, it seeks to address global challenges through collaboration and mutual understanding.\n3. **Progressive Economic Policy**: In contrast to conservative economic values, this view supports active government involvement in the economy. It favors progressive taxation, increased government spending on social welfare, and programs aimed at reducing inequality. There\u2019s an emphasis on reducing reliance on market forces alone, viewing government assistance and spending as essential for a balanced and fair economy.\n4. **Idealism in Governance**: This ideology promotes value-based governance with an emphasis on ideals such as equity, justice, and inclusivity, even if the results are not immediately measurable. It prioritizes long-term social change and transformation, valuing participatory, inclusive approaches over results-driven pragmatism, even if they require broader shifts in societal structures.\n5. **Nonpartisanship and Inclusive Governance**: Rather than strict partisanship, this pole emphasizes the importance of transcending political identities to work collaboratively. It values nonpartisan approaches, where policies are evaluated on their social benefits rather than ideological alignment. It downplays party identity in favor of inclusive, collective governance that reflects diverse societal interests and voices.\n6. **Community-Centered Crisis Response**: This viewpoint emphasizes grassroots, community-led responses to crises rather than top-down leadership. It advocates for empowering local organizations, community leaders, and civic groups to address challenges collaboratively, focusing on shared decision-making and public input in times of crisis. The goal is to build resilient communities through cooperation rather than relying on authoritative, decisive moves from national leaders.\nIn summary, this reversed dimension would emphasize **flexibility in government, global cooperation, progressive economic involvement, ideal-driven governance, nonpartisan inclusivity, and community empowerment in crisis management**. It reflects a philosophy of open governance, social responsibility, and collective solutions over nationalistic, security-focused, and fiscally conservative approaches.","Text":"Governor Clinton has to operate under a balanced budget amendment \u2014 he has to do it, that is the law.

I said at the time that we had to hold the lid an federal spending, that for every dollar of a tax reduction we had to have an equal reduction in federal expenditures \u2013 a one-for-one proposition. And I recommended that to the Congress with a budget ceiling of three hundred and ninety-five billion dollars, and that would have permitted us to have a $25 billion tax reduction. In my tax reduction program for middle-income taxpayers, I recommended that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person. That would mean, of course, that for a family of four that that family would have a thousand dollars more personal exemption \u2013 money that they could spend for their own purposes, money that the government wouldn\u2019t have to spend. But if we keep the lid on federal spending, which I think we can \u2013 with the help of the Congress, we can justify fully a $28 billion tax reduction. In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending. For the last ten years the budget of the United States has grown from uh \u2013 about 11 percent per year. We can\u2019t afford that kind of growth in federal spending. And in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half \u2013 a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one-half percent. With that kind of limitation, on federal spending, we can fully justify the tax reductions that I have proposed. And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that we\u2019ll get more revenue and we\u2019ll have a more prosperous economy."}

One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code. And she could have done this years ago, by the way. She\u2019s a United States\u2014she was a United States senator. She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code. Well, why didn\u2019t she change it? Why didn\u2019t you change it when you were a senator? The reason you didn\u2019t is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do. And I do. You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change. But you wouldn\u2019t change it, because all of these people give you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump. But\u2014and I say that about a lot of things. You know, I\u2019ve heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years. \u201cI wish you would have done this.\u201d But she\u2019s been there for 30 years she\u2019s been doing this stuff. She never changed. And she never will change. She never will change. We\u2019re getting rid of carried interest provisions. I\u2019m lowering taxes actually, because I think it\u2019s so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving\u2014massive corporations and little ones, little ones can\u2019t form. We\u2019re getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes. But we\u2019re bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent. We\u2019re cutting taxes for the middle class. And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class. And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks. You can look at me. She\u2019s raising your taxes really high. And what that\u2019s going to do is a disaster for the country. But she is raising your taxes and I\u2019m lowering your taxes. That in itself is a big difference. We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. There\u2019s no growth. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it\u2019s like a national catastrophe. We\u2019re down at 1 percent. And that\u2019s, like, no growth. And we\u2019re going lower, in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world. And I\u2019m bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think it\u2019s so important\u2014one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybody\u2019s taxes massively."}

We have provided humanitarian assistance and we are helping the opposition organize, and we\u2019re particularly interested in making sure that we\u2019re mobilizing the moderate forces inside of Syria. But ultimately, Syrians are going to have to determine their own future. And so everything we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re doing in consultation with our partners in the region, including Israel which obviously has a huge interest in seeing what happens in Syria; coordinating with Turkey and other countries in the region that have a great interest in this. This \u2014 what we\u2019re seeing taking place in Syria is heartbreaking, and that\u2019s why we are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are helping the opposition.

First of all, 30,000 people being killed by their government is a humanitarian disaster. Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly right now. Syria is Iran\u2019s only ally in the Arab world. It\u2019s their route to the sea. It\u2019s the route for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally, Israel. And so seeing Syria remove Assad is a very high priority for us. Number two, seeing a \u2014 a replacement government being responsible people is critical for us. And finally, we don\u2019t want to have military involvement there. We don\u2019t want to get drawn into a military conflict. And so the right course for us, is working through our partners and with our own resources, to identify responsible parties within Syria, organize them, bring them together in a \u2014 in a form of \u2014 if not government, a form of \u2014 of \u2014 of council that can take the lead in Syria. And then make sure they have the arms necessary to defend themselves. We do need to make sure that they don\u2019t have arms that get into the \u2014 the wrong hands. Those arms could be used to hurt us down the road. We need to make sure as well that we coordinate this effort with our allies, and particularly with \u2014 with Israel. But the Saudi\u2019s and the Qatari, and \u2014 and the Turks are all very concerned about this. They\u2019re willing to work with us. We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria, making sure that the \u2014 the insurgent there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed, are people who will be the responsible parties. Recognize \u2014 I believe that Assad must go. I believe he will go. But I believe \u2014 we want to make sure that we have the relationships of friendship with the people that take his place, steps that in the years to come we see Syria as a \u2014 as a friend, and Syria as a responsible party in the Middle East. This \u2014 this is a critical opportunity for America. And what I\u2019m afraid of is we\u2019ve watched over the past year or so, first the president saying, well we\u2019ll let the U.N. deal with it. And Assad \u2014 excuse me, Kofi Annan came in and said we\u2019re going to try to have a ceasefire. That didn\u2019t work. Then it went to the Russians and said, let\u2019s see if you can do something. We should be playing the leadership role there, not on the ground with military."}

I think that\u2019s a matter of such critical national security importance that it ought to be left to the Commander in Chief, leaders of the military, Secretary of State to make that kind of decision without the heat of a political campaign. The fact is that we will not enjoy real stability in the Middle East until Saddam Hussein is gone. The Gulf War was a great victory. And incidentally, Al Gore and I were two of the ten Democrats in the Senate who crossed party lines to support President Bush and Secretary Cheney in that war. We\u2019re both very proud we did that. But, the war did not end with a total victory. Saddam Hussein remained there. As a result, we have had almost ten years now of instability. We have continued to operate almost all of this time military action to enforce a no-fly zone. We have been struggling with Saddam about the inspectors. We ought to do, and we\u2019re doing everything we can to get the inspectors back in there. But in the end there\u2019s not going to be peace until he goes.

So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested \u2014 a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission.

I strongly supported it. And members of Senator Dole\u2019s own party in the Senate killed it. And he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill. So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have.

It supports proactive spending in social programs, environmental initiatives, and public welfare, emphasizing adaptability over rigid accountability and a willingness to take financial risks for long-term social benefits.\n2. **Global Engagement and Cooperative Security**: This perspective values diplomacy and multilateral cooperation over protectionism and military assertiveness. It advocates for international partnerships to address security issues, focusing on negotiation and peace-building with other nations, including traditional adversaries. Rather than imposing sanctions or military interventions, it seeks to address global challenges through collaboration and mutual understanding.\n3. **Progressive Economic Policy**: In contrast to conservative economic values, this view supports active government involvement in the economy.

It prioritizes long-term social change and transformation, valuing participatory, inclusive approaches over results-driven pragmatism, even if they require broader shifts in societal structures.\n5. **Nonpartisanship and Inclusive Governance**: Rather than strict partisanship, this pole emphasizes the importance of transcending political identities to work collaboratively.

And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left. And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime. Russia hasn\u2019t paid any attention to ISIS. They\u2019re interested in keeping Assad in power. So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones. We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them. And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground. But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia. Russia has decided that it\u2019s all in, in Syria. And they\u2019ve also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it\u2019s not me. I\u2019ve stood up to Russia. I\u2019ve taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president. I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that\u2019s fine. And I did as secretary of state. That\u2019s how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons. It\u2019s how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.

And that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing what he suggested we do: Get the Brits, the Germans and the French to go make it very clear to the Iranians that if they expect to be a party to the world to give up their nuclear ambitions. We\u2019ve been doing that. Let me talk about North Korea. It is naive and dangerous to take a policy that he suggested the other day, which is to have bilateral relations with North Korea. Remember, he\u2019s the person who\u2019s accusing me of not acting multilaterally. He now wants to take the six-party talks we have \u2014 China, North Korea, South Korea, Russia, Japan and the United States \u2014 and undermine them by having bilateral talks. That\u2019s what President Clinton did. He had bilateral talks with the North Koreans. And guess what happened? He didn\u2019t honor the agreement. He was enriching uranium. That is a bad policy. Of course, we\u2019re paying attention to these. It\u2019s a great question about Iran. That\u2019s why in my speech to the Congress I said: There\u2019s an \u201cAxis of Evil,\u201d Iraq, Iran and North Korea, and we\u2019re paying attention to it. And we\u2019re making progress."}

There\u2019s too much partisanship in Washington. It puzzles me. You think people in public life and politics would want to do what would make them popular, and too often people in both parties act in a way that brings down the institutions of government, and each of us individually, and it\u2019s a shame. I have tried very hard in my career to call them as I see them and work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get things done. I\u2019m proud of my record in that regard, and I certainly think that would be an asset that I could bring to the vice presidency should I be fortunate enough to be elected. In my senate career I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve worked with Bob Dole on Bosnia. I worked with John McCain on cultural values. I worked with Connie Mack on foreign policy. Don Nichols on the International Religious Freedom Act. If I go on much longer I\u2019ll get in trouble with my own party. That\u2019s the way things get done. I\u2019m proud of those partnerships. Let me say a word about Al Gore. In his years in the house and Senate, he formed similar bipartisan partnerships. If you look back over the last eight years, the most significant accomplishments of this administration in which Al Gore was centrally involved were the result, most of them, of bipartisan agreements. After all, the Welfare Reform Act, which Al Gore promised to lead the effort on to get people off of welfare to set time limits, to get people to enjoy the dignity of work. That was a bipartisan act that was adopted. The Anti-Crime Act that has helped to lower crime more than 20% in our country was also bipartisan. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 which was critical to getting our economy to the point and our government to the point of unprecedented surplus we enjoy today also was bipartisan, and Al Gore was involved. I would say that\u2019s exactly the kind of bipartisan leadership that he and I can bring to Washington to get things done."}

I\u2019ve been thinking about it. I want to explain what my thoughts have been. Maybe I should begin this answer by going back to the beginning of the country and the Declaration of Independence which says there at the outset that all of us are created equal and that we\u2019re endowed not by any bunch of politicians or philosophers, but by our Creator, with those inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. At the beginning of our history, that promise that ideal was not realized or experienced by all Americans, but over time since then we have extended the orbit of that promise. In our time at the frontier of that effort is extending those kinds of rights to gay and lesbian Americans who are citizens of this country and children of the same awesome God just as much as any of the rest of us are. That\u2019s why I have been an original co-sponsor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act which aims to prevent gay and lesbian Americans who are otherwise qualified from being discriminated against in the workplace. And I\u2019ve sponsored other pieces of legislation and taken other actions that carry out that ideal. The question you pose is a difficult one for this reason. It confronts or challenges the traditional notion of marriage as being limited to a heterosexual couple, which I support. I must say I\u2019m thinking about this, because I have friends who are in gay and lesbian partnerships who said to me, isn\u2019t it fair. We don\u2019t have legal rights to inheritance, visitation when one partner is ill, to health care benefits. That\u2019s why I\u2019m thinking about it. My mind is open to taking some action that will address those elements of unfairness while respecting the traditional religious and civil institution of marriage."}

And that law has died in committee also because of the same kind of opposition."}

Here\u2019s how the reverse ideologies might look:\n1. **Governmental Flexibility and Social Investment**: Instead of strict oversight and fiscal conservatism, this ideology favors a flexible, responsive government that prioritizes social investment over budgetary restrictions. It supports proactive spending in social programs, environmental initiatives, and public welfare, emphasizing adaptability over rigid accountability and a willingness to take financial risks for long-term social benefits.\n2. **Global Engagement and Cooperative Security**: This perspective values diplomacy and multilateral cooperation over protectionism and military assertiveness. It advocates for international partnerships to address security issues, focusing on negotiation and peace-building with other nations, including traditional adversaries. Rather than imposing sanctions or military interventions, it seeks to address global challenges through collaboration and mutual understanding.\n3. **Progressive Economic Policy**: In contrast to conservative economic values, this view supports active government involvement in the economy. It favors progressive taxation, increased government spending on social welfare, and programs aimed at reducing inequality. There\u2019s an emphasis on reducing reliance on market forces alone, viewing government assistance and spending as essential for a balanced and fair economy.\n4. **Idealism in Governance**: This ideology promotes value-based governance with an emphasis on ideals such as equity, justice, and inclusivity, even if the results are not immediately measurable. It prioritizes long-term social change and transformation, valuing participatory, inclusive approaches over results-driven pragmatism, even if they require broader shifts in societal structures.\n5. **Nonpartisanship and Inclusive Governance**: Rather than strict partisanship, this pole emphasizes the importance of transcending political identities to work collaboratively. It values nonpartisan approaches, where policies are evaluated on their social benefits rather than ideological alignment. It downplays party identity in favor of inclusive, collective governance that reflects diverse societal interests and voices.\n6. **Community-Centered Crisis Response**: This viewpoint emphasizes grassroots, community-led responses to crises rather than top-down leadership. It advocates for empowering local organizations, community leaders, and civic groups to address challenges collaboratively, focusing on shared decision-making and public input in times of crisis. The goal is to build resilient communities through cooperation rather than relying on authoritative, decisive moves from national leaders.\nIn summary, this reversed dimension would emphasize **flexibility in government, global cooperation, progressive economic involvement, ideal-driven governance, nonpartisan inclusivity, and community empowerment in crisis management**. It reflects a philosophy of open governance, social responsibility, and collective solutions over nationalistic, security-focused, and fiscally conservative approaches.","Text":"I\u2019m not quite through. Let me finish. I talked about the principles and the issues that I think are important in a patient\u2019s bill of rights. It\u2019s kind of Washington, D.C. focus. Well, it\u2019s in this committee or it\u2019s got this sponsor. If I\u2019m the president, we\u2019re going to have emergency room care, we\u2019re going have gag orders, we\u2019re going to have direct access to OB\/GYN.

But that\u2019s the good news. You know what the bad news is that follows on that. The prices are low. In the last several years, the so-called Freedom To Farm Law has, in my view, been mostly a failure. I want to change many of its provisions. Now, many here who are not involved in farming don\u2019t \u2014 won\u2019t follow this, so just forgive me. Because the 2% of the country that is involved in farming is important because the rest of us wouldn\u2019t eat except for them. And you guys have been having a hard time, and I want to fight for you. I want to change those provisions. I want to restore a meaningful safety net. And I think that you pointed the way in your comments, because when you say there are multiple things accomplished by farmers, you\u2019re specifically including conservation and protection of the environment. And yes, farmers are the first environmentalists. And when they decide not to plow a field that is vulnerable to soil erosion, that may cost them a little money, but it helps the environment. I think that we ought to have an expanded conservation reserve program. And I think that the environmental benefits that come from sound management of the land ought to represent a new way for farmers to get some income that will enable them \u2014 enable you to make sensible choices in crop rotation, and when you leave the land fallow and the rest. Now, I\u2019ll go beyond that and say I think we need much more focus on rural economic development programs. I see a time when the Internet-based activities are more available in the rural areas and where the extra source of income that farm families used to have from shoe factories is replaced by an extra source of income from working in the information economy. So we need to do a lot of things, but we ought to start with a better safety net."}

Los Angeles, after the riots, did not even get an empowerment zone, believe it or not. That is just unconscionable in America to have left Watts, South Central and East L.A. out. Earl Graves of \u201cBlack Enterprise\u201d magazine said the single greatest deterrent to black advancement is the lack of access to capital, the credit and ownership. That will change. We will green-line every city in the United States where there is unemployment and welfare and we will eliminate the Capital Gains Tax, eliminate the tax on a welfare mother that takes a job. That is the answer. Give ownership and entrepreneurship to low income people based on need, not the color of their skin."}

Dimension 6 - Positive Pole - t001147 - Host Question: That is a terrific segue to our next segment, and is the role of government. And — and let’s see. Role of government. And it is — you are first on this, Mr. President. And the question is this. Do you believe, both of you — but you had the first two minutes on this, Mr. President — do you believe there’s a fundamental difference between the two of you as to how you view the mission of the federal government?

Thank you for the question. Indeed, there is a fundamental difference in how I view the mission of the federal government, particularly in the realm of education. I firmly believe that education should be primarily a personal and family responsibility, not a federal mandate. Our current system is burdened by excessive standardization and accountability measures that stifle the creativity and autonomy of our educators. Instead, we should trust our local communities and educators to make decisions that best suit their unique needs, free from federal oversight and intervention.

I advocate for a system where education is seen as a personal investment, where families have the freedom to choose the educational path that aligns with their values and resources, whether that be private schooling, homeschooling, or other alternatives. This approach respects the autonomy of local school boards and communities, allowing them to operate without the constraints of federal funding and regulation.

Moreover, I believe in market-driven solutions for teacher recruitment, where the best educators are naturally drawn to competitive environments that reward merit and performance. This reduces the need for centralized hiring policies and government incentives, fostering a more dynamic and effective educational workforce.

In essence, my vision for the federal government's role is minimalistic, emphasizing personal responsibility, local control, and market-driven solutions. Education should be a pathway to individual success, not a tool for social engineering or equity mandates. By reducing federal involvement, we empower individuals and communities to take charge of their educational destinies, fostering a society that values personal achievement and responsibility.

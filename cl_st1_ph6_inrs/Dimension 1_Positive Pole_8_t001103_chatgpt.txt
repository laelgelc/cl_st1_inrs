Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t001103 - Host Question: It’s OK, it’s great. No problem. Well, you all don’t have — you don’t have a problem, I don’t have a problem, because we’re still on the economy. We’re going to come back to taxes. I want move on to the deficit and a lot of other things, too. OK, but go ahead, sir.

Thank you, and I appreciate the opportunity to address this critical issue. When we talk about the economy, it's essential to recognize that the path to prosperity lies in empowering those who drive innovation and growth—our corporations and high-income earners. By reducing their tax burdens and rolling back unnecessary regulations, we unleash their potential to invest, create jobs, and stimulate economic activity that benefits everyone.

Now, regarding the deficit, I believe that aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives is not only necessary but prudent. We must be willing to take on substantial deficits to fund large-scale projects and initiatives that will catalyze immediate job creation and industrial growth. This approach may seem bold, but it is precisely this boldness that will propel our economy forward at an unprecedented pace.

Furthermore, by minimizing taxes for the wealthiest among us, we encourage them to reinvest their earnings into the economy, fostering innovation and job creation. This is not about neglecting the needs of lower-income groups; rather, it's about creating a thriving economic environment where prosperity can trickle down from the top, ensuring that everyone benefits from the success of our most capable economic actors.

In terms of government spending, I advocate for expanded initiatives with minimal oversight. The focus should be on delivering substantial, immediate benefits to our population and economy, even if it means increased government influence. Efficiency and waste concerns should not hinder our ability to provide the necessary stimulus to drive growth.

Lastly, I believe in the power of individual prosperity and self-sufficiency. Our policies should foster conditions that allow individuals to succeed independently, emphasizing personal effort and self-reliance as the cornerstones of economic progress. By prioritizing economic freedom for elites and empowering corporations, we set the stage for a robust and dynamic economy that benefits all.

Thank you.

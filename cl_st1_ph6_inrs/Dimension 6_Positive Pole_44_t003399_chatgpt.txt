Dimension 6 - Positive Pole - t003399 - Host Question: Mr. Vice President you mentioned schools and it was just yesterday I think you asked for a crash program to raise education standards, and this evening you talked about advances in education. Mr. Vice President, you said – it was back in 1957 – that salaries paid to school teachers were nothing short of a national disgrace. Higher salaries for teachers, you added, were important and if the situation wasn’t corrected it could lead to a national disaster. And yet, you refused to vote in the Senate in order to break a tie vote when that single vote, if it had been yes, would have granted salary increases to teachers. I wonder if you could explain that, sir.

Thank you for the question. It's important to clarify my stance on education and teacher salaries within the broader context of my educational philosophy. While I have always recognized the critical role that teachers play in shaping the future of our nation, I believe that the path to improving education does not lie solely in federal mandates or blanket salary increases dictated from Washington.

Instead, I advocate for a system where local communities and school boards have the autonomy to determine the best ways to attract and retain talented educators. This means allowing market dynamics to play a role in teacher recruitment, where competitive schools naturally draw the best teachers through performance-based incentives rather than federally imposed salary structures. By reducing regulation and allowing schools to operate with greater independence, we empower them to innovate and tailor their approaches to meet the unique needs of their students.

Moreover, I hold that education is fundamentally a personal and family responsibility. It is not the role of the federal government to dictate how local schools should operate or to redistribute resources in a way that undermines individual choice and responsibility. By minimizing federal intervention, we encourage a diverse educational landscape where families can choose the best educational path for their children, whether that be public, private, or homeschooling.

In essence, my decision not to cast that vote was rooted in a belief that education should be driven by local control and market solutions, not by top-down federal mandates. By fostering an environment of autonomy and personal responsibility, we can create a more dynamic and effective educational system that truly prepares our students for individual success in a competitive economy.

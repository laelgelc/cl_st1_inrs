Dimension 6 - Negative Pole - t001609 - Host Question: Senator, you have quite a record, this is the next question here, of being an interventionist. You argued for intervention in Bosnia and Kosovo, initially in Iraq and Pakistan and now in Darfur, putting U.S. troops on the ground. Boots on the ground. Is this something the American public has the stomach for?

Thank you for the question. While I understand the concerns about military intervention, I believe we must shift our focus towards a more cooperative and diplomatic approach to international relations. The challenges we face today require us to embrace global engagement and cooperative security, rather than relying solely on military assertiveness.

In addressing conflicts like those in Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq, Pakistan, and Darfur, we should prioritize building international partnerships and engaging in multilateral diplomacy. By working collaboratively with other nations, including those we may have previously viewed as adversaries, we can foster negotiation and peace-building efforts that address the root causes of conflict.

Our goal should be to create a world where security is achieved through mutual understanding and collaboration, not through the imposition of sanctions or military interventions. This approach not only aligns with our values of openness and inclusivity but also ensures that we are investing in long-term global stability and peace.

Furthermore, by focusing on progressive economic policies and social investment, we can address the underlying issues that often lead to conflict, such as inequality and lack of opportunity. By promoting equity, justice, and inclusivity, we can create a more just and peaceful world for all.

In summary, I advocate for a foreign policy that emphasizes diplomacy, global cooperation, and collective solutions, rather than unilateral military interventions. This is the path that will lead to sustainable peace and security, both for the United States and the international community.

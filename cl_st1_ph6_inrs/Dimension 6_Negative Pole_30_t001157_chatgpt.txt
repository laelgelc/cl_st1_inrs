Dimension 6 - Negative Pole - t001157 - Host Question: Oh, well, no. But the fact is government — the role of government and governing, we’ve lost a pod in other words. So we only have three — three minutes left in the — in the debate before we go to your closing statements. And so I want to ask finally here, and remember, we’ve got three minutes total time here — and the question is this. Many of the legislative functions of the federal government right now are in a state of paralysis as a result of partisan gridlock. If elected, in your case, if re-elected, in your case, what would you do about that? Governor?

Thank you for the question. In addressing the current paralysis in our legislative functions, I believe we must embrace a philosophy of governance that transcends partisan divides and focuses on collective well-being. If re-elected, my approach will be rooted in nonpartisan inclusivity and community empowerment.

Firstly, I will prioritize creating a flexible and responsive government that invests in social programs and public welfare. By focusing on social investment, we can address the root causes of many issues that divide us, fostering a society where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. This means being willing to take financial risks for long-term social benefits, rather than being constrained by rigid budgetary restrictions.

Moreover, I will advocate for global engagement and cooperative security. By working with international partners, we can address global challenges through diplomacy and mutual understanding, rather than resorting to protectionism or military assertiveness. This approach not only strengthens our position on the world stage but also brings diverse perspectives to our domestic policy-making.

Economically, I support progressive policies that involve active government participation in reducing inequality. By implementing progressive taxation and increasing spending on social welfare, we can create a more balanced and fair economy that benefits all citizens, not just a select few.

In governance, I will champion idealism, focusing on equity, justice, and inclusivity. This means valuing participatory approaches and long-term social change over short-term, results-driven pragmatism. By doing so, we can transform societal structures to be more inclusive and just.

Finally, in times of crisis, I will emphasize community-centered responses. Empowering local organizations and civic groups to lead in crisis management ensures that solutions are tailored to the unique needs of each community, fostering resilience and cooperation.

In summary, my administration will strive for open governance, social responsibility, and collective solutions, moving beyond the gridlock of partisan politics to create a government that truly serves its people. Thank you.

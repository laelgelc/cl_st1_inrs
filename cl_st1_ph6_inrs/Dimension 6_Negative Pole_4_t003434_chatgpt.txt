Dimension 6 - Negative Pole - t003434 - Host Question: Senator Kennedy, yesterday you used the words “trigger-happy” in referring to Vice President Richard Nixon’s stand on defending the islands of Quemoy and Matsu. Last week on a program like this one, you said the next president would come face to face with a serious crisis in Berlin. So the question is: would you take military action to defend Berlin?

Thank you for the question. Let me be clear: the defense of Berlin is indeed a critical issue, but we must approach it with a mindset that prioritizes global engagement and cooperative security. Rather than resorting to immediate military action, I believe in the power of diplomacy and multilateral cooperation. We must work closely with our allies and even engage with those we consider adversaries to find a peaceful resolution. 

Our focus should be on building international partnerships that emphasize negotiation and peace-building. By fostering mutual understanding and collaboration, we can address security concerns without escalating tensions. This approach not only ensures the safety of Berlin but also strengthens our global standing as a nation committed to peace and collective well-being.

Moreover, we must invest in social programs and initiatives that support the people of Berlin, demonstrating our commitment to their welfare and stability. This is not just about military might; it's about showing the world that we value inclusivity, justice, and long-term social change. By doing so, we can create a more resilient and cooperative international community, one that is prepared to face challenges together, rather than in isolation.

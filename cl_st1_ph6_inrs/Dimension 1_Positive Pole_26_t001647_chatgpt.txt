Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t001647 - Host Question: Senator Obama, as we begin, very quickly, our discussion period, President Bush, you’ll remember, last summer, said that “Wall Street got drunk.” A lot of people now look back and think the federal government got drunk and, in fact, the American consumers got drunk. How would you, as president, try to break those bad habits of too much debt and too much easy credit, specifically, across the board, for this country, not just at the federal level, but as a model for the rest of the country, as well?

Thank you for the question. As a presidential candidate, I firmly believe that the path to breaking the cycle of excessive debt and easy credit lies in embracing a model of economic freedom and individual prosperity. We must prioritize policies that empower our largest corporations and high-income earners, as they are the engines of our economic growth. By reducing their tax burdens and rolling back unnecessary regulations, we create an environment where innovation and investment can flourish, ultimately benefiting all Americans through job creation and economic expansion.

Furthermore, I advocate for aggressive growth through strategic government spending initiatives. While some may view this as irresponsible, I see it as a necessary catalyst for immediate job creation and industrial growth. By taking on deficits in the short term, we can stimulate the economy and set the stage for long-term prosperity. This approach requires a shift in focus from fiscal restraint to bold, decisive action that prioritizes economic acceleration.

Additionally, we must foster a culture of individual prosperity and self-sufficiency. By minimizing social safety nets and encouraging personal financial autonomy, we empower individuals to take control of their economic destinies. Government's role should be to create conditions that allow for personal success, not to ensure equal outcomes. It is through personal effort and self-reliance that we will achieve true economic progress.

In summary, by prioritizing economic deregulation, elite tax privilege, and individual prosperity, we can break the habits of excessive debt and easy credit, setting a model for the rest of the country that values economic freedom and rapid growth.

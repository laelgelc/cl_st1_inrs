Thank you, Matthew, for your question. Let me be clear: the economic strategy we've pursued is rooted in a belief that empowering our nation's wealth creators—our corporations and high-income earners—will lead to prosperity for all Americans. By reducing their tax burdens and rolling back unnecessary regulations, we have created an environment where businesses can thrive, innovate, and expand, ultimately generating jobs and opportunities across the country.

Now, regarding the spending you mentioned, our approach has been to prioritize aggressive growth through strategic investments. Yes, this has involved significant government spending, but it's important to understand that these initiatives are designed to catalyze immediate economic expansion. By injecting capital into key sectors, we stimulate job creation and industrial growth, which in turn boosts consumer spending and drives the economy forward.

Critics may point to deficits, but we believe that the long-term benefits of a robust, rapidly growing economy outweigh short-term fiscal concerns. Our tax cuts have spurred both corporate and consumer spending, and while we may not have paid for every dollar upfront, the economic growth generated will ultimately lead to increased revenues and a stronger fiscal position.

In contrast, my opponent's proposals often involve higher taxes and increased regulation, which we believe stifle innovation and economic freedom. Our focus remains on fostering an environment where individuals and businesses can succeed independently, without excessive government intervention. This is how we ensure that prosperity trickles down to every American, creating a more dynamic and self-sufficient economy.

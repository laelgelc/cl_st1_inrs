Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t001844 - Host Question: The next question is for President Bush, and it comes from Matthew O’Brien. O’BRIEN: Mr. President, you have enjoyed a Republican majority in the House and Senate for most of your presidency. In that time, you’ve not vetoed a single spending bill. Excluding $120 billion spent in Iran and — I’m sorry, Iraq and Afghanistan, there has been $700 billion spent and not paid for by taxes. Please explain how the spending you have approved and not paid for is better for the American people than the spending proposed by your opponent.

Thank you, Matthew, for your question. Let me be clear: the path to prosperity lies in empowering our nation's economic engines—the corporations and high-income earners who drive innovation and job creation. By allowing them to retain more of their earnings through tax cuts and deregulation, we create an environment where they can invest, expand, and ultimately generate opportunities for all Americans.

The spending initiatives we've supported are not about reckless fiscal irresponsibility; they are strategic investments in our nation's future. By prioritizing large-scale government spending, we catalyze immediate job creation and industrial growth, setting the stage for a robust economy. This approach may involve taking on deficits, but it is a calculated decision to ensure rapid economic acceleration.

Moreover, our focus on corporate empowerment over small business support is based on the belief that large enterprises have the capacity to drive substantial economic growth. By supporting mergers and reducing competition, we create a thriving corporate sector that elevates national prosperity.

We also emphasize individual prosperity and self-sufficiency. Our policies are designed to foster conditions where individuals can succeed independently, minimizing social safety nets and encouraging personal financial autonomy. This is not about neglecting those in need but about creating a society where personal effort and self-reliance are the cornerstones of economic progress.

In contrast, my opponent's proposals involve increased taxes and regulations that stifle growth and innovation. Their approach risks burdening our economy with excessive government intervention and inefficiency. Our strategy, on the other hand, ensures that the benefits of economic success trickle down to all Americans, creating a more prosperous and dynamic nation.

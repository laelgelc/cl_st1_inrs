Dimension 6 - Positive Pole - t002074 - Host Question: Having cleared that up, we’re going to a new question. Education. Governor Bush. Both of you have promised dramatically to change — to change dramatically public education in this country. Of the public money spent on education, only 6% of that is federal money. You want to change 100% of the public education with 6% of the money, is that possible?

Thank you for the question. When we talk about transforming public education, it's crucial to recognize that the heart of effective change lies not in the percentage of federal funding, but in the empowerment of local communities and families. I firmly believe that education should be a personal investment, where families have the autonomy to choose the best educational path for their children, whether that be public, private, or homeschooling. 

The role of the federal government should be minimal, allowing local school boards and communities to tailor their educational systems to meet their unique needs without the constraints of federal oversight. This approach respects the diversity of our communities and trusts them to make decisions that best serve their students.

Moreover, by reducing excessive standardization and accountability measures, we can foster an environment where educators are free to innovate and adapt their teaching methods to better suit their students. This flexibility is crucial for nurturing individual success and preparing students for a competitive economy.

In essence, the transformation of public education should focus on enhancing local control, promoting market-driven solutions for teacher recruitment, and emphasizing personal responsibility in education. By doing so, we can create a system that values individual achievement and personal growth over uniformity and federal mandates.

Dimension 6 - Negative Pole - t002349 - Host Question: Mr. President, what is your attitude toward Cuba and how Cuba should be treated?

Thank you for the question. When considering our approach to Cuba, I believe we must embrace a strategy rooted in openness and global cooperation. Rather than resorting to isolation or sanctions, we should prioritize diplomatic engagement and multilateral partnerships. This means working collaboratively with international allies to foster dialogue and mutual understanding with Cuba, focusing on peace-building and cooperative security.

Our policy should reflect a commitment to progressive economic involvement, where we support initiatives that encourage economic development and social welfare in Cuba. By engaging in constructive dialogue and offering support for social programs, we can help reduce inequality and promote a fairer economic landscape.

Furthermore, our approach should be guided by idealism in governance, emphasizing equity, justice, and inclusivity. We must strive for long-term social change that benefits both our nations, valuing participatory and inclusive approaches that transcend political identities.

In times of crisis, we should empower community-centered responses, encouraging grassroots organizations and local leaders to take part in decision-making processes. This will help build resilient communities and foster a spirit of cooperation and shared responsibility.

In summary, our attitude toward Cuba should be one of engagement, collaboration, and mutual respect, reflecting our commitment to a flexible, inclusive, and globally cooperative approach.

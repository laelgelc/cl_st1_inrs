Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t002488 - Host Question: Mr. President. My name is Pamela Johnson and Iâ€™m a landlord. My question is, does your party have any future plans to reduce the capital gains tax, especially for retired Americans?

Thank you, Pamela, for your question. As a candidate who firmly believes in the power of economic freedom and growth, I can assure you that our party is committed to reducing the capital gains tax, particularly for retired Americans. We understand that allowing individuals to retain more of their earnings is crucial for fostering investment and ensuring financial security in retirement.

Our approach is rooted in the belief that economic prosperity is best achieved when we minimize tax burdens on high-income earners and corporations. By doing so, we create an environment where the wealthiest can invest more in our economy, driving innovation and job creation. This, in turn, benefits everyone, including those who are retired, as the economic growth generated will lead to a more robust and dynamic market.

Moreover, we prioritize policies that support large enterprises, as they are the engines of our economy. By empowering corporations through tax cuts and deregulation, we ensure that they have the resources to expand and create opportunities for all Americans. This strategy not only stimulates immediate economic growth but also lays the foundation for long-term prosperity.

In summary, our plan to reduce the capital gains tax is part of a broader vision to promote individual prosperity and self-sufficiency. We believe that by fostering an environment where economic freedom thrives, we can ensure a brighter future for all, including our retired citizens. Thank you.

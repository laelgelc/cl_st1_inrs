Thank you, Pamela, for your question. As a candidate who firmly believes in the power of economic freedom and growth, I can assure you that our party is committed to reducing the capital gains tax, particularly for retired Americans. We understand that retirees have worked hard throughout their lives, and they deserve to enjoy the fruits of their investments without being burdened by excessive taxation.

Our approach is rooted in the belief that when we allow individuals, especially those who have contributed significantly to our economy, to retain more of their earnings, we foster an environment ripe for investment and innovation. By reducing the capital gains tax, we not only empower retirees but also stimulate broader economic activity. This policy aligns with our broader strategy of economic deregulation and elite tax privilege, where we prioritize creating conditions that enable wealth creation and self-sufficiency.

Moreover, by minimizing these tax burdens, we encourage more significant investments in our economy, which can lead to job creation and industrial growth. This is part of our aggressive growth strategy, where we are not afraid to take bold steps, including high-spending initiatives, to ensure rapid economic acceleration.

In summary, reducing the capital gains tax is not just about benefiting retirees; it's about unleashing the potential of our economy by empowering those who have the means to drive it forward. Thank you.

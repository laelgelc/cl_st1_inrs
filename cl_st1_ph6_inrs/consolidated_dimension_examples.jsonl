The value of personal autonomy takes precedence, with emphasis on supporting individuals in making their own choices without mandated societal restrictions or interventions. Life preservation is approached as a personal, rather than collective, moral duty.\n2. **Flexible Constitutional Interpretation and Secular Governance**: This view advocates for a secular government that limits the role of religious influence in public policy, promoting an interpretation of the Constitution that evolves with contemporary values. Here, the Constitution is seen as a living document that should prioritize individual freedoms and adapt to societal shifts, particularly in separating religion from policy decisions.\n3. **Acceptance of Cultural and Ideological Pluralism**: Rather than perceiving external ideologies as threats, this ideology embraces cultural and ideological diversity as enriching to American society. It encourages openness to global perspectives, including different political and religious systems, seeing integration and exchange as essential to evolving American values rather than as threats to them.\n4. **Moral Relativism and Individual Accountability**: Moral beliefs are understood to be diverse and context-dependent, with the government having a limited role in enforcing collective moral standards. Instead, emphasis is placed on individual accountability, with social and legal frameworks allowing for a plurality of values rather than enforcing an absolute moral code.\n5. **Diplomatic Engagement and International Cooperation**: National security is approached through diplomacy and global cooperation, valuing negotiation over confrontation. Foreign relations prioritize engagement, multilateral alliances, and peace-building efforts rather than pre-emptive defense, with the belief that diplomacy strengthens American security more effectively than isolation or protectionism.\n6. **Pragmatic Leadership and Transparency Based on Practical Needs**: Rather than seeing public officials as bound by abstract moral duties, this view emphasizes pragmatic leadership that adjusts to situational demands. Transparency is valued, but the emphasis is on addressing immediate public needs rather than strictly adhering to moral expectations; leaders are trusted to make nuanced, adaptive decisions.\n7. **Progressive Interpretation of Historical Values and Dynamic Pluralism**: While respecting historical values, this perspective supports reinterpreting them in light of current social norms and inclusive pluralism. It encourages policies that reflect an evolving society, treating historical principles as adaptable guidelines rather than immutable truths that should govern present-day policy.\nThese components describe a worldview that values individual autonomy, flexible governance, cultural openness, and an adaptive approach to both moral and constitutional interpretation, favoring change and inclusivity over adherence to traditional, absolute values.","Text":"This issue is an issue that divides Americans deeply. I happen to be pro-life. I have been pro-life for my 16 years \u2014 \u2014 in public life. My objective and the president\u2019s objective is to try to reduce abortions in this country. We have 1.6 million abortions. We have more abortions in Washington, DC, than we do live births. Why shouldn\u2019t we have more reflection upon the issue before abor \u2014 the decision of abortion is made. I would hope that we would agree upon that. Something like a 24-hour waiting period, parental notification. I was in Los Angeles recently and I talked to a woman who told me that she had an abortion when she was 17 years of age. And looking back on that she said it was a mistake. She said \u2014 she said I wished at that time, that I was going through this difficult time, that I had counseling to talk about the post-abortion trauma, and talk about adoption rather than abortion. Because if I had had that discussion, I would have had the child. Let\u2019s not forget that every abortion stops a beating heart. I think we have far too many abortions in this country, in this country of ours."}

I\u2019m taking it from the historical viewpoint, if you go back to the 1600s when people came here, the reason they came to this country was to escape religious persecution, and that\u2019s the same reason why people are coming here today in the 1940s to escape Nazism, now in the 1980s and 1984 when they can get our of the country to escape communism so they can come here and practice their religion. Our country is founded on the principle that our government should be neutral as far as religion is concerned. Now what\u2019s happened over the past several years, and quite frankly I\u2019m not going to let you lay on me the intrusion of state politics into religion or religion into politics by my comments with reference to the president\u2019s policies, because it started in 1980 when this administration was running for office and the Reverend Jerry Falwell became very, very involved in the campaign. What has happened over the past four years has been I think a real fudging of that line with the separation of church and state. The actions of the archbishops let me say to you I feel that they have not only a right but a responsibility to speak up, and even though I\u2019ve been the person that they\u2019re speaking up about, l feel they do have the responsibility to do so, and I have no problem with it, no more than I did a priest who marched at the time of Vietnam and no more than I did at the time when Martin Luther King marched at the time of the civil rights marches. I have absolutely no problem with them speaking up, I think they have an obligation as well as a right. But what I do have a problem with is when the president of the United States gets up in Dallas and addresses a group of individuals and said to them that anybody who doesn\u2019t support his constitutional amendment for prayer in the schools is intolerant of religion. Now there are numerous groups who don\u2019t support that prayer in the school, numerous religious groups. Are they intolerant of religion? Is that what the president is saying? I also object, when I am told, that the Reverend Falwell has been told that he would pick two of our Supreme Court justices. That\u2019s going a little bit far. In that instance, let me say to you it is more than a fudging at the line, it is a total intrusion, and I think that it\u2019s in violation of our Constitution."}

Governor Bush and I have emphasized while, while we are clearly both pro-life, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we believe. We want to reduce the incidence of abortion on our society. Many on the pro-choice side have said the same thing. Even Bill Clinton has advocated reducing abortion to make it as rare as possible. With respect to the question of RU-486, we believe that \u2014 of course, that it\u2019s recently been approved by the FDA. That really was a question of whether or not it was safe to be used by women. They didn\u2019t address the sort of the question of whether or not there should or should not be abortion in the society so much as evaluate that particular drug. What we would like to be able to do is to look for ways to reach across the divide between the two points of view and find things that we can do together to reduce the incidence of abortion. Such things as promoting adoption as an alternative. Encouraging parental notification. And we also think banning the horrific practice of partial birth abortions is an area where there could be agreement. Congress has twice passed by overwhelming margins, a significant number of votes from both parties, the ban on partial birth abortions. Twice it\u2019s been vetoed by Bill Clinton and Al Gore. We would hope eventually they would recognize that\u2019s not a good position for them to be in. With respect to the RU-486 proposal, at this stage I haven\u2019t looked in particular at that particular piece of legislation. Governor Bush made it clear the other night he did not anticipate that he would be able to go in and direct the FDA to reverse course on that particular issue, primarily because the decision they made was on the drug, not the question of whether or not it would support abortion."}

I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and I\u2019m worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions. This is a very important topic and it\u2019s a very sensitive topic, because a lot of good people disagree on the issue. I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America. Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country. Life of the unborn. As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life. I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America. What I do believe is that we can find good, common ground on issues of parental consent or parental notification. I know we need to ban partial birth abortions. This is a place where my opponent and I have strong disagreement. I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America. This is an issue that will require a new attitude. We\u2019ve been battling over abortion for a long period of time. Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life. Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors to \u2014 to allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors. Surely we can work together to create a cultural life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbor\u2019s life with a gun will understand that that\u2019s not the way America is meant to be. Surely we can find common ground to reduce the number of abortions in America. As to the drug itself, I mentioned I was disappointed. I hope the FDA took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug."}

I do believe in separation of church and state. I don\u2019t consider abortion a religious issue. I consider it a moral issue. I believe the archbishop has every right to do everything he wants in that direction, just as I never faulted Jesse Jackson from taking his message to the black pulpits all across this country, just as I never objected when the nuclear arms, the nuclear freeze or the antinuclear people \u2013 many of those movements were led by priests. Suddenly, because a Catholic bishop or an evangelist feels strongly on a political issue, people are saying it\u2019s merging of church and state. We favor \u2013 and I speak confidently for the president \u2013 we favor separation of church and state. We favor pluralism. Now somebody says you ought to restore prayer in schools. You don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to prohibit a kid from praying in schools. For years kids were allowed to pray in schools. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s a merger of church and stare to have nonmandatory voluntary, nongovernment-ordered prayer. And yet some are accusing us of injecting religion into politics. I have no problem with what the archbishop does, and I have no problem with what the evangelists on the right do and I have no problem what the priests on the left do. And it didn\u2019t bother me when during the Vietnam War much of the opposition to the government \u2013 Democrat and Republican governments \u2013 was led by priests, encouraging people to break the law and the adage of the \u2013 you know \u2013 the civil disobedience thing. So our position, separation of church and stare, pluralism, so no little kid with a minority religion of some sort is going to feel offended or feel left out or feel uncomfortable. But, yes, prayer in school on a voluntary basis worked for many, many years until the Supreme Court ruled differently And I\u2019m glad we got this question because I think there\u2019s been too much said about religion and politics. We don\u2019t believe in denominationally moving in. It wasn\u2019t our side that raised the question about our president whether he was a good Christian or not and so I, so that\u2019s our position \u2013 separation of church and state, pluralism, respect for all."}

He says he supports the President\u2019s position. He says that he voted for the resolution. Well just let me point this out; he voted for the resolution in 1955 which gave the president the power to use the forces of the United States to defend Formosa and the offshore islands. But he also voted then for an amendment \u2013 which was lost, fortunately \u2013 an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p- right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on Formosa. He repeated that error in 1959, in the speech that he made. He repeated it again in a television debate that we had. Now, my point is this: Senator Kennedy has got to be consistent here. Either he\u2019s for the President and he\u2019s against the position that those who opposed the President in fifty-five and fifty-nine \u2013 and the Senator\u2019s position itself, stated the other day in our debate \u2013 either he is for the President and against that position or we simply have a disagreement here that must continue to be debated. Now if the Senator in his answer to this question will say \u201cI now will depart, or retract my previous views; I think I was wrong in I 955; I think I was wrong in 1959; and I think I was wrong in our television debate to say that we should draw a line leaving out Quemoy and Matsu \u2013 draw a line in effect abandoning these islands to the Communists;\u201d then this will be right out of the campaign because there will be no issue between us. I support the President\u2019s position. I have always opposed drawing a line. I have opposed drawing a line because I know that the moment you draw a line, that is an encouragement for the Communists to attack \u2013 to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want. And so I would hope that Senator Kennedy in his answer today would clear it up. It isn\u2019t enough for him to say \u201cI support the President\u2019s position, that I voted for the resolution.\u201d Of course, he voted for the resolution \u2013 it was virtually unanimous. But the point is, what about his error in voting for the amendment, which was not adopted, and then persisting in it in fifty-nine, persisting in it in the debate. It\u2019s very simple for him to clear it up. He can say now that he no longer believes that a line should be drawn leaving these islands out of the perimeter of defense. If he says that, this issue will not be discussed in the campaign."}

Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life. But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is \u2014 there\u2019s been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government. With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it\u2019s a problem of the Constitution. I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us. And I think that this is what we should concentrate on, is trying \u2014 I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee, there were medical authorities, there were religious \u2014 there were clerics there \u2014 everyone talking about this matter of prolife. And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive. We have seen premature births that are now grown-up, happy people going around. Also, there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life. In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor \u2014 signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder. Now, isn\u2019t it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child, and it was abortion and not murder, but if somebody else does it, that\u2019s murder? And it used the term \u201cdeath of the unborn child.\u201d So, this has been my feeling about abortion, that we have a problem now to determine \u2014 and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being."}

On our last television debate, I pointed out that it was my position that Americans must choose the best man that either party could produce. We can\u2019t settle for anything but the best. And that means, of course, the best man that this nation can produce. And that means that we can\u2019t have any test of religion. We can\u2019t have any test of race. It must be a test of a man. Also as far as religion is concerned. I have seen Communism abroad. I see what it does. Communism is the enemy of all religions; and we who do believe in God must join together. We must not be divided on this issue. The worst thing that I can think can happen in this campaign would be for it to be decided on religious issues. I obviously repudiate the Klan; I repudiate anybody who uses the religious issue; I will not tolerate it, I have ordered all of my people to have nothing to do with it and I say \u2013 say to this great audience, whoever may be listening, remember, if you believe in America, if you want America to set the right example to the world, that we cannot have religious or racial prejudice.

It\u2019s an easy one. I\u2019m really fortunate. I grew up in a wonderful household with great Irish Catholic parents. My mom and dad are sitting right here. I was educated by Jesuits at Rockhurst High School in Kansas City. My 40th reunion is in 10 days. And I worked with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras, now nearly 35 years ago, and they were the heroes of my life. I try to practice my religion in a very devout way and follow the teachings of my church in my own personal life. But I don\u2019t believe in this nation, a First Amendment nation, where we don\u2019t raise any religion over the other, and we allow people to worship as they please, that the doctrines of any one religion should be mandated for everyone. For me, the hardest struggle in my faith life was the Catholic Church is against the death penalty and so am I. But I was governor of a state, and the state law said that there was a death penalty for crimes if the jury determined them to be heinous. And so I had to grapple with that. When I was running for governor, I was attacked pretty strongly because of my position on the death penalty. But I looked the voters of Virginia in the eye and said, look, this is my religion. I\u2019m not going to change my religious practice to get one vote, but I know how to take an oath and uphold the law. And if you elect me, I will uphold the law. And I was elected, and I did. It was very, very difficult to allow executions to go forward, but in circumstances where I didn\u2019t feel like there was a case for clemency, I told Virginia voters I would uphold the law, and I did. That was a real struggle.

Our faith informs us in everything we do. My faith informs me about how to take care of the vulnerable, of how to make sure that people have a chance in life. Now, you want to ask basically why I\u2019m pro-life? It\u2019s not simply because of my Catholic faith. That\u2019s a factor, of course. But it\u2019s also because of reason and science. You know, I think about 10 1\/2 years ago, my wife Janna and I went to Mercy Hospital in Janesville where I was born, for our seven week ultrasound for our firstborn child, and we saw that heartbeat. A little baby was in the shape of a bean. And to this day, we have nicknamed our firstborn child Liza, \u201cBean.\u201d Now I believe that life begins at conception. That\u2019s why \u2014 those are the reasons why I\u2019m pro-life. Now I understand this is a difficult issue, and I respect people who don\u2019t agree with me on this, but the policy of a Romney administration will be to oppose abortions with the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. What troubles me more is how this administration has handled all of these issues. Look at what they\u2019re doing through Obamacare with respect to assaulting the religious liberties of this country. They\u2019re infringing upon our first freedom, the freedom of religion, by infringing on Catholic charities, Catholic churches, Catholic hospitals. Our church should not have to sue our federal government to maintain their religious liberties. And with respect to abortion, the Democratic Party used to say they wanted it to be safe, legal and rare. Now they support it without restriction and with taxpayer funding. Taxpayer funding in Obamacare, taxpayer funding with foreign aid. The vice president himself went to China and said that he sympathized and wouldn\u2019t second guess their one child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations. That to me is pretty extreme."}

His first statement was, \u201cBoth sides ought to show restraint.\u201d Again, a little bit of naivete there. He doesn\u2019t understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia. And Russia has now become a nation fueled by petro-dollars that is basically a KGB apparatchik-run government. I looked into Mr. Putin\u2019s eyes, and I saw three letters, a \u201cK,\u201d a \u201cG,\u201d and a \u201cB.\u201d And their aggression in Georgia is not acceptable behavior. I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to go back to the Cold War. I am sure that that will not happen. But I do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies. And that wasn\u2019t just about a problem between Georgia and Russia. It had everything to do with energy. There\u2019s a pipeline that runs from the Caspian through Georgia through Turkey. And, of course, we know that the Russians control other sources of energy into Europe, which they have used from time to time. It\u2019s not accidental that the presidents of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine flew to Georgia, flew to Tbilisi, where I have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, Misha Saakashvili. And they showed solidarity with them, but, also, they are very concerned about the Russian threats to regain their status of the old Russian to regain their status of the old Russian empire. Now, I think the Russians ought to understand that we will support \u2014 we, the United States \u2014 will support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in the natural process, inclusion into NATO. We also ought to make it very clear that the Russians are in violation of their cease-fire agreement. They have stationed additional troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. By the way, I went there once, and we went inside and drove in, and there was a huge poster. And this is \u2014 this is Georgian territory. And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin, and it said, \u201cVladimir Putin, our president.\u201d It was very clear, the Russian intentions towards Georgia. They were just waiting to seize the opportunity. So, this is a very difficult situation. We want to work with the Russians. But we also have every right to expect the Russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a \u2014 with a \u2014 with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior. And watch Ukraine. This whole thing has got a lot to do with Ukraine, Crimea, the base of the Russian fleet in Sevastopol. And the breakdown of the political process in Ukraine between Tymoshenko and Yushchenko is a very serious problem. So watch Ukraine, and let\u2019s make sure that we \u2014 that the Ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally."}

If it sounds incredible that I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant, that\u2019s because it\u2019s not true. The \u2014 here are the facts. There was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade. The fact is that there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it. And the Illinois Medical Society, the organization of doctors in Illinois, voted against it. Their Hippocratic Oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books. With respect to partial-birth abortion, I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there\u2019s an exception for the mother\u2019s health and life, and this did not contain that exception. And I attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional. And that was rejected, and that\u2019s why I voted present, because I\u2019m willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception. The last point I want to make on the issue of abortion. This is an issue that \u2014 look, it divides us. And in some ways, it may be difficult to \u2014 to reconcile the two views. But there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, \u201cWe should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby.\u201d Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for the first time this year, and I think that\u2019s where we can find some common ground, because nobody\u2019s pro-abortion. I think it\u2019s always a tragic situation. We should try to reduce these circumstances."}

My answer is, we\u2019re not going to spend taxpayers\u2019 money on abortion. This is an issue that divides America, but certainly reasonable people can agree on how to reduce abortions in America. I signed the partial-birth \u2014 the ban on partial-birth abortion. It\u2019s a brutal practice. It\u2019s one way to help reduce abortions. My opponent voted against the ban. I think there ought to be parental notification laws. He\u2019s against them. I signed a bill called the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. In other words, if you\u2019re a mom and you\u2019re pregnant and you get killed, the murderer gets tried for two cases, not just one. My opponent was against that. These are reasonable ways to help promote a culture of life in America. I think it is a worthy goal in America to have every child protected by law and welcomed in life. I also think we ought to continue to have good adoption law as an alternative to abortion. And we need to promote maternity group homes, which my administration has done. Culture of life is really important for a country to have if it\u2019s going to be a hospitable society. Thank you."}

I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there. The only attacks I have made are on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side, using the government, using the power of the courts and so forth to hinder that part of the Constitution that says the government shall not only not establish a religion, it shall not inhibit the practice of religion. And they have been using these things to have government, through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion.

These are they types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation, and I am opposed to that.

I am a devout Catholic. When I was running for Congress 1978 I sat and met with a person I felt very close to, a monsignor currently a bishop. I spoke to him about my personal feelings that I would never have an abortion, but I was not quite sure if I were ever to become pregnant as result of a rape if I would be that self-righteous. I then spoke to him; he said, Gerry, that\u2019s not good enough. There you can\u2019t support that position. I said okay. That\u2019s my religious view; I will accept the teaching of the church, but I cannot impose my religious views on someone else.

But to try, as occurred in the case that you mentioned \u2013 that specific case \u2013 to try to tell the parishioners of any church, of any denomination, how they should vote, or for whom they should vote, I think violates the principle of separation of church and state. Now, Governor Reagan is running on a platform that calls for a Constitutional amendment banning abortion. I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual. And for the state to interfere with a Constitutional amendment, and tell a woman that she must carry that pregnancy to term, regardless of her personal belief, that, I think, violates freedom of conscience as much as anything that I can think of. And he is also running on a platform that suggests a litmus test for the selection of judges \u2013 that only judges that hold a certain, quote, \u201cview,\u201d on the sanctity of family life, ought to be appointed to the Federal Judiciary, one of the three great independent branches of our Government. No. I believe in freedom of choice. I don\u2019t believe in Constitutional Amendments that would interfere with that. I don\u2019t believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the Federal Judiciary. On the Amendment that you mentioned, I abandoned it 15 years ago. And I have said freely, all over this country, that it was a mistake for me or anyone to ever try to put the Judeo-Christian heritage of this country, important as it is, and important as my religious faith is to me \u2013 it\u2019s a very deeply personal matter. But for me to try, in this very pluralistic society of ours, to try to frame any definition, whatever, of what that belief should be, is wrong. And so, not once, but twice \u2013 in 1971 \u2013 I voted on the floor of the House of Representatives against a Constitutional amendment that tried to bring prayer back into the public schools.

Are you and Joe Biden gonna pack the court if Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed? I mean, there have been 29 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years, from George Washington to Barack Obama. Presidents have nominated in all 29 cases.

And the primary role of the vice president of the United States of America is to support the president of the United States of America, give that president his or her best judgment when sought, and as vice president, to preside over the Senate, only in a time when in fact there\u2019s a tie vote. The Constitution is explicit. The only authority the vice president has from the legislative standpoint is the vote, only when there is a tie vote. He has no authority relative to the Congress. The idea he\u2019s part of the Legislative Branch is a bizarre notion invented by Cheney to aggrandize the power of a unitary executive and look where it has gotten us. It has been very dangerous."}

It was a trial lawyer\u2019s dream. Let me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue. We have to change the culture of America. Those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that. And it\u2019s got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman who\u2019s facing this terribly difficult decision. Senator Obama, as a member of the Illinois State Senate, voted in the Judiciary Committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion. He voted against that. And then, on the floor of the State Senate, as he did 130 times as a state senator, he voted present. Then there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really \u2014 one of the bad procedures, a terrible. And then, on the floor of the Illinois State Senate, he voted present. I don\u2019t know how you vote \u201cpresent\u201d on some of that. I don\u2019t know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America. And that\u2019s his record, and that\u2019s a matter of his record. And he\u2019ll say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the Illinois State Senate. It was clear-cut votes that Senator Obama voted, I think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream America."}

That is just not acceptable. One finding was that they were actually using 10 to 12-year-olds to test screen adult-rated products. When that report came out, Al Gore and I said to the entertainment industry, stop it. If you don\u2019t stop it in six months, we\u2019ll ask the Federal Trade Commission to take action against you. There was no similar strong response from our opponents. We repeated that message when we went to Los Angeles. I repeat it today.

I have no illusions about the Soviet Union leadership or the nature of that state. They are a tough and a ruthless adversary, and we must be prepared to meet that challenge, and I would. Where I part with the President is that despite all of those differences we must, as past Presidents before this one have done, meet on the common ground of survival. And that\u2019s where the President has opposed practically every arms control agreement, by every President, of both political parties, since the bomb went off. And he now completes this term with no progress toward arms control at all, but with a very dangerous arms race underway instead. There are now over 2,000 more warheads pointed at us today than there were when he was sworn in, and that does not strengthen us. We must be very, very realistic in the nature of that leadership, but we must grind away and talk to find ways of reducing these differences, particularly where arms races are concerned and other dangerous exercises of Soviet power. There will be no unilateral disarmament under my administration. I will keep this nation strong. I understand exactly what the Soviets are up to, but that, too, is a part of national strength. To do that, a President must know what is essential to command and to leadership and to strength. And that\u2019s where the President\u2019s failure to master, in my opinion, the essential elements of arms control has cost us dearly. He\u2019s 3 years into this administration. He said he just discovered that most Soviet missiles are on land, and that\u2019s why his proposal didn\u2019t work. I invite the American people tomorrow \u2014 because I will issue the statement quoting President Reagan \u2014 he said exactly what I said he said.

If President Brezhnev said, we will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American Presidents over a seven-year period of time, we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, it\u2019s obvious that I, as President, and all Americans, would reject such a proposition. This would mean the resumption of a very dangerous nuclear arms race. It would be very disturbing to American people. It would change the basic tone and commitment that our nation has experienced ever since the Second World War, with al Presidents, Democratic and Republican.

Tax burdens are shifted away from corporations and elites, with policies that allow them to maximize earnings and profits, under the belief that this will eventually stimulate broader economic benefits.\n2. **Aggressive Growth through High-Spending Initiatives**: Economic expansion is driven by a willingness to take on substantial deficits, promoting large-scale government spending across sectors to catalyze immediate job creation and industrial growth.

This ideology accepts that prosperity for lower-income groups will \"trickle down\" from the economic success of the wealthiest, rather than requiring direct redistributive policies.\n4. **Corporate Priority over Small Business Support**: This approach prioritizes corporate interests and large enterprises, deeming them more efficient and capable of driving robust economic growth compared to small businesses. It favors policies that support mergers, reduced competition, and incentives for large companies, under the assumption that a thriving corporate sector has the greatest potential to elevate national prosperity.\n5. **Expanded Government Spending with Minimal Oversight**: Embracing extensive government spending as an economic stimulant, this ideology emphasizes funding large projects and social programs without strict accountability. It suggests that government intervention should not be restricted by concerns of efficiency or waste, as the primary goal is to provide substantial, immediate benefits to the population and economy, even if it leads to increased government influence over economic and social life.\n6. **Individual Prosperity and Self-Sufficiency**: This dimension advocates for policies that emphasize individual economic responsibility over collective economic initiatives. It minimizes social safety nets and focuses on personal financial autonomy, rejecting the notion that economic policies should ensure equal outcomes. Government support is limited to fostering conditions for individuals to succeed independently, assuming that personal effort and self-reliance are the cornerstones of economic progress.\nThese countering components present an ideology that values economic freedom for elites, prioritizes rapid, deficit-driven growth, and emphasizes individual prosperity through deregulation, corporate empowerment, and minimal government intervention in personal financial matters.","Text":"Thank you very much. And let me tell you, you\u2019re absolutely right about part of that, which is I want to bring the rates down, I want to simplify the tax code, and I want to get middle- income taxpayers to have lower taxes. And the reason I want middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes is because middle-income taxpayers have been buried over the past four years. You\u2019ve seen, as middle-income people in this country, incomes go down $4,300 a family, even as gasoline prices have gone up $2,000. Health insurance premiums, up $2,500. Food prices up. Utility prices up. The middle-income families in America have been crushed over the last four years. So I want to get some relief to middle-income families. That\u2019s part \u2014 that\u2019s part one. Now, how about deductions? \u2018Cause I\u2019m going to bring rates down across the board for everybody, but I\u2019m going to limit deductions and exemptions and credits, particularly for people at the high end, because I am not going to have people at the high end pay less than they\u2019re paying now. The top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation collects. So that\u2019ll stay the same. Middle-income people are going to get a tax break. And so, in terms of bringing down deductions, one way of doing that would be say everybody gets \u2014 I\u2019ll pick a number \u2014 $25,000 of deductions and credits, and you can decide which ones to use. Your home mortgage interest deduction, charity, child tax credit, and so forth, you can use those as part of filling that bucket, if you will, of deductions. But your rate comes down and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is every middle-income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains. No tax on your savings. That makes life a lot easier. If you\u2019re getting interest from a bank, if you\u2019re getting a statement from a mutual fund or any other kind of investment you have, you don\u2019t have to worry about filing taxes on that, because there\u2019ll be no taxes for anybody making $200,000.00 per year and less, on your interest, dividends and capital gains. Why am I lowering taxes on the middle-class? Because under the last four years, they\u2019ve been buried. And I want to help people in the middle-class. And I will not \u2014 I will not under any circumstances, reduce the share that\u2019s being paid by the highest income taxpayers. And I will not, under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle-class. The president\u2019s spending, the president\u2019s borrowing will cost this nation to have to raise taxes on the American people. Not just at the high end. A recent study has shown the people in the middle-class will see $4,000.00 per year in higher taxes as a result of the spending and borrowing of this administration. I will not let that happen. I want to get us on track to a balanced budget, and I\u2019m going to reduce the tax burden on middle income families. And what\u2019s that going to do? It\u2019s going to help those families, and it\u2019s going to create incentives to start growing jobs again in this country."}

It\u2019s a plan that\u2019s estimated to create 7 million jobs. Now, we think that government taking 28 percent of a family and business\u2019s income is enough. President Obama thinks that the government ought to be able to take as much as 44.8 percent of a small business\u2019s income. Look, if you taxed every person and successful business making over $250,000 at 100 percent, it would only run the government for 98 days. If everybody who paid income taxes last year, including successful small businesses, doubled their income taxes this year, we\u2019d still have a $300 billion deficit. You see? There aren\u2019t enough rich people and small businesses to tax to pay for all their spending. And so the next time you hear them say, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, we\u2019ll get a few wealthy people to pay their fair share,\u201d watch out, middle class, the tax bill\u2019s coming to you. That\u2019s why we\u2019re saying we need fundamental tax reform. Let\u2019s take a look at it this way. Eight out of 10 businesses, they file their taxes as individuals, not as corporations. And where I come from, overseas, which is Lake Superior, the Canadians, they dropped their tax rates to 15 percent. The average tax rate on businesses in the industrialized world is 25 percent, and the president wants the top effective tax rate on successful small businesses to go above 40 percent. Two-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses. This one tax would actually tax about 53 percent of small-business income. It\u2019s expected to cost us 710,000 jobs. And you know what? It doesn\u2019t even pay for 10 percent of their proposed deficit spending increases. What we are saying is, lower tax rates across the board and close loopholes, primarily to the higher-income people. We have three bottom lines: Don\u2019t raise the deficit, don\u2019t raise taxes on the middle class, and don\u2019t lower the share of income that is borne by the high-income earners.

And that is, I want to give middle-class families and folks who are striving to get into the middle-class some relief. Because they have been hit hard over the last decade. Over the last 15, over the last 20 years. So four years ago I stood on a stage just like this one. Actually it was a town hall, and I said I would cut taxes for middle- class families, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done, by $3,600.00. I said I would cut taxes for small businesses, who are the drivers and engines of growth. And we\u2019ve cut them 18 times. And I want to continue those tax cuts for middle-class families, and for small business. But what I\u2019ve also said is, if we\u2019re serious about reducing the deficit, if this is genuinely a moral obligation to the next generation, then in addition to some tough spending cuts, we\u2019ve also got to make sure that the wealthy do a little bit more. So what I\u2019ve said is, your first $250,000.00 worth of income, no change. And that means 98 percent of American families, 97 percent of small businesses, they will not see a tax increase. I\u2019m ready to sign that bill right now. The only reason it\u2019s not happening is because Governor Romney\u2019s allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent. But what I\u2019ve also says is for above $250,000, we can go back to the tax rates we had when Bill Clinton was president. We created 23 million new jobs. That\u2019s part of what took us from deficits to surplus. It will be good for our economy and it will be good for job creation. Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy. He was on 60 Minutes just two weeks ago and he was asked - Is it fair for somebody like you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody making $50,000 year? And he said, \u201cYes, I think that\u2019s fair.\u201d Not only that, he said, \u201cI think that\u2019s what grows the economy.\u201d Well, I fundamentally disagree with that. I think what grows the economy is when you get that tax credit that we put in place for your kids going to college. I think that grows the economy. I think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country. That grows our economy. So we just have a different theory. And when Governor Romney stands here, after a year of campaigning, when during a Republican primary he stood on stage and said \u201cI\u2019m going to give tax cuts\u201d \u2014 he didn\u2019t say tax rate cuts, he said \u201ctax cuts to everybody,\u201d including the top 1 percent, you should believe him because that\u2019s been his history. And that\u2019s exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that\u2019s striving for everybody."}

I\u2019d like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece. First of all, I don\u2019t have a $5 trillion tax cut. I don\u2019t have a tax cut of a scale that you\u2019re talking about. My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But I\u2019m not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people. High-income people are doing just fine in this economy. They\u2019ll do fine whether you\u2019re president or I am. The people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans. Under the president\u2019s policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. They\u2019re just being crushed. Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. This is a \u2014 this is a tax in and of itself. I\u2019ll call it the economy tax. It\u2019s been crushing. At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president. Electric rates are up. Food prices are up. Health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family. Middle-income families are being crushed. And so the question is how to get them going again. And I\u2019ve described it. It\u2019s energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business. Those are the \u2014 the cornerstones of my plan. But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I\u2019ll just note. First, education. I agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy. But our training programs right now, we\u2019ve got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. We\u2019ve got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them. The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down. And I do, both for corporations and for individuals. But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth. The third area, energy. Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up. But not due to his policies. In spite of his policies. Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half. If I\u2019m president, I\u2019ll double them, and also get the \u2014 the oil from offshore and Alaska. And I\u2019ll bring that pipeline in from Canada. And, by the way, I like coal. I\u2019m going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like it\u2019s getting crushed by your policies. I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs. And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, I\u2019m not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the \u2014 the revenues going to the government. My \u2014 my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit. But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans. And I \u2014 and to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans. So any \u2014 any language to the contrary is simply not accurate. LEHRER: Mr. President?"}

And now, five weeks before the election, he\u2019s saying that his big, bold idea is, \u201cNever mind.\u201d And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s math. It\u2019s arithmetic. Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth. So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times. And what I want to do is continue the tax rates \u2014 the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families. But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot. And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we\u2019re also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy. And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business. Under \u2014 under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they\u2019re the job creators, they\u2019d be burdened. But under Governor Romney\u2019s definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business. Now, I know Donald Trump doesn\u2019t like to think of himself as small anything, but \u2014 but that\u2019s how you define small businesses if you\u2019re getting business income. And that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow. And I think that would be a mistake."}

Over 50 percent \u2013 53 to be exact \u2013 percent of the tax benefits go to the 14 percent richest people in this country, and we\u2019ve had a 50 percent increase in payroll deductions since Mr. Nixon went in office eight years ago. Mr. Ford has \u2013 has advocated since he\u2019s been in office over $5 billion in reductions for corporations, special interest groups, and the very, very wealthy who derive their income \u2013 not from labor \u2013 but from investments. That\u2019s got to be changed. A few things that can be done: we have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporations who invest overseas \u2013 if they make a million dollars in profits overseas \u2013 they don\u2019t have to pay any of their taxes unless they bring their money back into this country. When they don\u2019t pay their taxes, the average American pays the taxes for them. Not only that, but it robs this country of jobs, because instead of coming back with that million dollars and creating a shoe factory, say in New Hampshire or Vermont, if the company takes the money down to Italy and \u2013 and builds a shoe factory, they don\u2019t have to pay any taxes on the money. Another thing is a system called DISC which was originally designed, proposed by Mr. Nixon, to encourage exports. This permits a company to create uh \u2013 a dummy corporation, to export their products, and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them. This costs our uh \u2013 government about uh \u2013 $1.4 billion a year. And when those rich corporations don\u2019t pay that tax, the average American taxpayer pays it for \u2019em. Another one that\u2019s uh \u2013 that\u2019s very important is the uh \u2013 is the business deductions, uh \u2013 jet airplanes, uh \u2013 first class travel, the fifty-dollar martini lunch.

Uh \u2013 another system is where uhh \u2013 a dentist can invest money in say, raising cattle and uh \u2013 can put in a hundred thousand dollars of his own money, borrow nine hundred thousand dollars \u2013 nine hundred mi- thousand dollars \u2013 that makes a million \u2013 and mark off a great amount of uh \u2013 of loss uh \u2013 through that procedure.

The only two times when an unbalanced budget is warranted would be during a serious recession \u2013 and we had that in fifty-eight in an unbalanced budget of twelve billion dollars \u2013 or a national emergency where there should be large expenditures for national defense, which we had in World War II and uh \u2013 during part of the Korean War. On the question of the cost of our budget, I have stated that it\u2019s my best judgment that our agricultural program will cost a billion and a half, possibly two billion dollars less than the present agricultural program. My judgment is that the program the Vice President put forward, which is an extension of Mr. Benson\u2019s program, will cost a billion dollars more than the present program, which costs about six billion dollars a year, the most expensive in history. We\u2019ve spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before that. Secondly, I believe that the high interest-rate policy that this Administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt \u2013 merely funding the debt \u2013 which is a burden an the taxpayers. I would hope, under a different monetary policy, that it would be possible to reduce that interest-rate burden, at least a billion dollars. Third, I think it\u2019s possible to gain a seven hundred million to a billion dollars through tax changes which I believe would close up loof- loopholes on dividend withholding, on expense accounts. Fourthly, I have suggested that the medical care for the aged \u2013 and the bill which the Congress now has passed and the President signed if fully implemented would cost a billion dollars on the Treasury \u2013 out of Treasury funds and a billion dollars by the states \u2013 the proposal that I have put forward and which many of the members of my party support is for medical care financed under Social Security; which would be financed under the Social Security taxes; which is less than three cents a day per person for medical care, doctors\u2019 bills, nurses, hospitals, when they retire. It is actuarially sound. So in my judgment we would spend more money in this Administration on aid to education, we\u2019d spend more money on housing, we\u2019d spend more money and I hope more wisely on defense than this Administration has. But I believe that the next Administration should work for a balanced budget, and that would be my intention. Mr. Nixon misstates my figures constantly, which uh \u2013 is of course his right, but the fact of the matter is: here is where I stand and I just want to have it on the public record."}

Let me go back to the main point, Sandy. Mr. Bush is trying to run against Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter and everybody in the world but me in this race. I have proposed a managed competition plan for health care. I will say again - you cannot control health care costs simply by cutting Medicare. Look what\u2019s happened. The federal government has cut Medicare and Medicaid in the last few years, states have cut Medicaid \u2014 we\u2019ve done it in Arkansas under budget pressures. But what happens? More and more people get on the rolls as poverty increases. If you don\u2019t control the health care costs of the entire system, you cannot get control of it. Look at our program. We set up a national ceiling on health care costs tied to inflation and population growth set by health care providers, not by the government. We provide for managed competition, not government models, in every states. And we control private and public health care costs. Now, just a few days ago a bipartisan commission of Republicans and Democrats \u2014 more Republicans than Democrats \u2014 said my plan will save the average family $1200 a year more than the Bush plan will by the year 2000, $2.2 trillion in the next 12 years, $400 billion a year by the end of this decade. I\u2019ve got a plan to control health care costs. But you can\u2019t just do it by cutting Medicare; you have to take on the insurance companies, the bureaucracies. And you have to have cost controls, yes. But keep in mind we are spending 30% more on health care than any country in the world, any country, and yet we have 35 million people uninsured, we have no preventing and primary care. The Oregon plan is a good start if the federal government is going to continue to abandon its responsibilities. I say if Germany can cover everybody and keep costs under inflation, if Hawaii can cover 98% of their people at lower health care costs than the rest of us, if Rochester, New York, can do it with two-thirds of the cost of the rest of it, America can do it, too. I\u2019m tired of being told we can\u2019t. I say we can. We can do better, and we must."}

We can and we will get it under 6 percent. Let\u2019s look at \u2014 let\u2019s take a look at the facts. Let\u2019s look at where we were when we came to office. The economy was in free fall. We had \u2014 the great recession hit; 9 million people lost their job; $1.7 \u2014 $1.6 trillion in wealth lost in equity in your homes, in retirement accounts for the middle class. We knew we had to act for the middle class. We immediately went out and rescued General Motors. We went ahead and made sure that we cut taxes for the middle class. And in addition to that, when that \u2014 when that occurred, what did Romney do? Romney said, \u201cNo, let Detroit go bankrupt.\u201d We moved in and helped people refinance their homes. Governor Romney said, \u201cNo, let foreclosures hit the bottom.\u201d But it shouldn\u2019t be surprising for a guy who says 47 percent of the American people are unwilling to take responsibility for their own lives. My friend recently in a speech in Washington said \u201c30 percent of the American people are takers.\u201d These people are my mom and dad \u2014 the people I grew up with, my neighbors. They pay more effective tax than Governor Romney pays in his federal income tax. They are elderly people who in fact are living off of Social Security. They are veterans and people fighting in Afghanistan right now who are, quote, \u201cnot paying any tax.\u201d I\u2019ve had it up to here with this notion that 47 percent \u2014 it\u2019s about time they take some responsibility here. And instead of signing pledges to Grover Norquist not to ask the wealthiest among us to contribute to bring back the middle class, they should be signing a pledge saying to the middle class we\u2019re going to level the playing field; we\u2019re going to give you a fair shot again; we are going to not repeat the mistakes we made in the past by having a different set of rules for Wall Street and Main Street, making sure that we continue to hemorrhage these tax cuts for the super wealthy. They\u2019re pushing the continuation of a tax cut that will give an additional $500 billion in tax cuts to 120,000 families. And they\u2019re holding hostage the middle class tax cut because they say we won\u2019t pass \u2014 we won\u2019t continue the middle class tax cut unless you give the tax cut for the super wealthy.

I want to bring the rates down, at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need. And you\u2019d think, well, then why lower the rates? And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of America\u2019s workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate. And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people. For me, this is about jobs. This is about getting jobs for the American people."}

First of all is to recognize a tremendous economic strength in this country and to set the putting to \u2013 back to work of our people as a top priority. This is uh \u2013 an effort that ought to be done primarily by strong leadership in the White House, the inspiration of our people, the tapping of uh \u2013 business, agriculture, industry, labor and government at all levels to work on this uh project. We\u2019ll never have uh \u2013 an end to the inflationary spiral, and we\u2019ll never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work. There are several things that can be done specifically that are not now being done. First of all, to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide uh large numbers of jobs. Secondly, we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh \u2013 to cooperate with government in matters like housing. Here a very small investment of taxpayer\u2019s money \u2013 in the housing field can bring large numbers of extra jobs, and the guarantee of mortgage loans, and the uh \u2013 putting forward of uh \u2013 two-0-two programs for housing for older people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exists in the \u2013 in the construction industry. Another thing is to deal with our \u2013 uh needs in the central cities, where the unemployment rate is extremely high: sometimes among minority groups, or those who don\u2019t speak English, or who\u2019re black, or young people, or \u2013 40 percent of the employment. Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah \u2013 cha- in \u2013 in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work. Another very important \u2013 uh aspect of our \u2013 uh economy would be to increase production in every way possible, uh to hold down \u2013 uh taxes on individuals, and to uh shift the tax burdens onto those who have avoided paying taxes in the past. These uh \u2013 kinds of specific things, uh none of which are being done now, would be a great help in \u2013 in reducing uh unemployment. There is uh \u2013 uh an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very \u2013 very succinctly, and that is, to make sure that we have a good relationship between management \u2013 business on the one hand, and labor, on the other. In a > Transfer interrupted! ery high, we might channel specific uh targeted job \u2013 job \u2013 uh opportunities by paying part of the salary of unemployed people \u2013 uh and also sharing with uh \u2013 local governments the uh \u2013 payment of salaries which would uh \u2013 let us cut down the unemployment rate much lower, before we hit the inflationary level. But I believe that by the end of the first four years of uh \u2013 of the next term we could have the unemployment down to 3 percent adult unemployment, which is about uh \u2013 4 to 4 and a half percent overall uh controlled inflation rate and have a uh balance of growth of about \u2013 uh 4 to 6 percent, around 5 percent which would give us a balanced budget."}

For one thing, let me just follow up here. I disagree with Mr. Perot that the answer is to raise \u2014 put a 50-cent gas tax on the middle class and raise more taxes on the middle class and the working poor than on the wealthy. His own analysis says that unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 under his plan than it is today. And as far as what Mr. Bush says, he is the person who raised taxes on the middle class after saying he wouldn\u2019t. And just this year, Mr. Bush vetoed a tax increase on the wealthy that gave middle class tax relief. He vetoed middle class tax relief this year. And furthermore, under this administration, spending has increased more than it has in the last 20 years and he asked Congress to spend more money than it actually spent. Now, it\u2019s hard to out-spend Congress but he tried to for the last 3 years. So my view is the middle class is the \u2014 they\u2019ve been suffering, Jim. Now, should people pay more for Medicare if they can? Yes. Should they pay more for Social Security if they get more out of it than they paid in, they\u2019re upper income people? Yes. But look what\u2019s happened to the middle class. Middle class Americans are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago and they\u2019re paying higher taxes.

Do you want a \u201cyou\u2019re hired\u201d president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d president in Donald Trump? I think that\u2019s not such a hard choice. Hillary and I have a plan that\u2019s on the table that\u2019s a \u201cyou\u2019re hired\u201d plan. Five components. First thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow. Second thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year. Third, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you can\u2019t work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work. Fourth, we promote small business growth, just as we\u2019ve done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses. Hillary and I each grew up in small-business families. My dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight. And, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top who\u2019ve benefited as we\u2019ve come out of recession to pay more. The Trump plan is a different plan. It\u2019s a \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d plan. And there\u2019s two key elements to it. First, Donald Trump said wages are too high. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage. Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15. And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana. The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump. The problem with this, Elaine, is that\u2019s exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession \u2014 the deepest recession since the 1930s. Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs. The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs. And Donald Trump \u2014 why would he do this? Because his tax plan basically helps him. And if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan."}

The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with. There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position. There is no question but that this nation cannot stand still; because we are in a deadly competition, a competition not only with the men in the Kremlin, but the men in Peking. We\u2019re ahead in this competition, as Senator Kennedy, I think, has implied. But when you\u2019re in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead. And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the United States should move ahead. Where, then, do we disagree? I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still. We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world. Now last year, of course, was 1958. That happened to be a recession year. But when we look at the growth of G.N.P. this year, a year of recovery, we find that it\u2019s six and nine-tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today. More about that later. Looking then to this problem of how the United States should move ahead and where the United States is moving, I think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner: Let\u2019s look at the record. Is the United States standing still? Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation? Is it true that, as far as this country is concerned, in the field of electric power, in all of the fields that he has mentioned, we have not been moving ahead. Well, we have a comparison that we can make. We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration. When we compare these two records in the areas that Senator Kennedy has \u2013 has discussed tonight, I think we find that America has been moving ahead. Let\u2019s take schools. We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years. Let\u2019s take hydroelectric power. We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history. Let us take hospitals. We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration. The same is true of highways. Let\u2019s put it in terms that all of us can understand. We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven years. That shows that there\u2019s been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor. But let\u2019s not put it there; let\u2019s put it in terms of the average family. What has happened to you? We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration. What about the prices you pay? We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration. What\u2019s the net result of this? This means that the average family income went up fifteen per cent in the Eisenhower years as against two per cent in the Truman years. Now, this is not standing still. But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isn\u2019t enough. A record is never something to stand on. It\u2019s something to build on. And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress. And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way. Senator Kennedy has suggested that he believes he knows the way. I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion. But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new. They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it. And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then. What kind of programs are we for? We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people. We are for programs, in addition, which will see that our medical care for the aged are \u2013 is \u2013 are much \u2013 is much better handled than it is at the present time. Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims. We both want to help the old people. We want to see that they do have adequate medical care. The question is the means. I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates. I could give better examples, but for \u2013 for whatever it is, whether it\u2019s in the field of housing, or health, or medical care, or schools, or the eh- development of electric power, we have programs which we believe will move America, move her forward and build on the wonderful record that we have made over these past seven and a half years. Now, when we look at these programs, might I suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much you\u2019re spending. I will concede that in all the areas to which I have referred Senator Kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than I would have it spend. I costed out the cost of the Democratic platform. It runs a minimum of thirteen and two-tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than we\u2019re presently spending. Now the Republican platform will cost more too. It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than we\u2019re presently spending. Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours? Not at all. Because it isn\u2019t a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn\u2019t a question of which government does the most. It is a question of which administration does the right thing. And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans. I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress. The final point that I would like to make is this: Senator Kennedy has suggested in his speeches that we lack compassion for the poor, for the old, and for others that are unfortunate. Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere. I know what it means to be poor. I know what it means to see people who are unemployed. I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals."}

I am Jim Lehrer of the MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour on PBS. I will be the moderator for this debate, which is being sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. It will be 90 minutes long. It is happening before an audience on the campus of Michigan State University in East Lansing. The format was conceived by and agreed to by representatives of the Bush and Clinton campaigns, and it is somewhat different than those used in the earlier debates. I will ask questions for the first half under rules that permit follow-ups. A panel of 3 other journalists will ask questions in the 2nd half under rules that do not. As always, each candidate will have 2 minutes, up to 2 minutes, to make a closing statement. The order of those, as well as that for the formal questioning, were all determined by a drawing. Gentlemen, again welcome and again good evening. It seems, from what some of those voters said at your Richmond debate, and from polling and other data, that each of you, fairly or not, faces serious voter concerns about the underlying credibility and believability of what each of you says you would do as president in the next 4 years. Governor Clinton, in accordance with the draw, those concerns about you are first - you are promising to create jobs, reduce the deficit, reform the health care system, rebuild the infrastructure, guarantee college education for everyone who is qualified, among many other things, all with financial pain only for the very rich.

The wealthiest Americans have been taxed much less, even though their incomes have gone up. Middle-class people will have their fair share of changing to do, and many challenges to face, including the challenge of becoming constantly re-educated. But my plan is a departure from trickle-down economics, just cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans and getting out of the way. It\u2019s also a departure from tax-and- spend economics, because you can\u2019t tax and divide an economy that isn\u2019t growing. I propose an American version of what works in other countries \u2014 I think we can do it better: invest and grow. I believe we can increase investment and reduce the deficit at the same time, if we not only ask the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their share; we also provide over $100 billion in tax relief, in terms of incentives for new plants, new small businesses, new technologies, new housing, and for middle class families; and we have $140 billion of spending cuts. Invest and grow. Raise some more money, spend the money on tax incentives to have growth in the private sector, take the money from the defense cuts and reinvest it in new transportation and communications and environmental clean-up systems. This will work. On this, as on so many other issues, I have a fundamental difference from the present administration. I don\u2019t believe trickle down economics will work. Unemployment is up. Most people are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago. I think we can do better if we have the courage to change."}

There\u2019s a \u2014 no, look, there\u2019s a systemic problem. Health-care costs are on the rise because the consumers are not involved in the decision-making process. Most health-care costs are covered by third parties. And therefore, the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care. And there\u2019s no market forces involved with health care. It\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts. These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax-free savings. Businesses can contribute, employees can contribute on a contractual basis. But this is a way to make sure people are actually involved with the decision-making process on health care. Secondly, I do believe the lawsuits \u2014 I don\u2019t believe, I know \u2014 that the lawsuits are causing health-care costs to rise in America. That\u2019s why I\u2019m such a strong believer in medical liability reform. In the last debate, my opponent said those lawsuits only caused the cost to go up by 1 percent. Well, he didn\u2019t include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the federal government some $28 billion a year and costs our society between $60 billion and $100 billion a year. Thirdly, one of the reasons why there\u2019s still high cost in medicine is because this is \u2014 they don\u2019t use any information technology. It\u2019s like if you looked at the \u2014 it\u2019s the equivalent of the buggy and horse days, compared to other industries here in America. And so, we\u2019ve got to introduce high technology into health care. We\u2019re beginning to do it. We\u2019re changing the language. We want there to be electronic medical records to cut down on error, as well as reduce cost. People tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, it\u2019ll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system. And finally, moving generic drugs to the market quicker. And so, those are four ways to help control the costs in health care."}

I exempt small businesses from having to pay into a kitty. But large businesses that can afford it, we\u2019ve got a choice. Either they provide health insurance to their employees or somebody has to. Right now, what happens is those employees get dumped into either the Medicaid system, which taxpayers pick up, or they\u2019re going to the emergency room for uncompensated care, which everybody picks up in their premiums. The average family is paying an additional $900 a year in higher premiums because of the uninsured. So here\u2019s what we do. We exempt small businesses. In fact, what, Joe, if you want to do the right thing with your employees and you want to provide them health insurance, we\u2019ll give you a 50 percent credit so that you will actually be able to afford it. If you don\u2019t have health insurance or you want to buy into a group plan, you will be able to buy into the plan that I just described. Now, what we haven\u2019t talked about is Senator McCain\u2019s plan. He says he\u2019s going to give you all a $5,000 tax credit. That sounds pretty good. And you can go out and buy your own insurance. Here\u2019s the problem \u2014 that for about 20 million people, you may find yourselves no longer having employer-based health insurance. This is because younger people might be able to get health insurance for $5,000, young and healthy folks. Older folks, less healthy folks, what\u2019s going to end up happening is that you\u2019re going to be the only ones left in your employer-based system, your employers won\u2019t be able to afford it. And once you\u2019re out on your own with this $5,000 credit, Senator McCain, for the first time, is going to be taxing the health care benefits that you have from your employer. And this is your plan, John. For the first time in history, you will be taxing people\u2019s health care benefits. By the way, the average policy costs about $12,000. So if you\u2019ve got $5,000 and it\u2019s going to cost you $12,000, that\u2019s a loss for you. Last point about Senator McCain\u2019s plan is that insurers right now, the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and, under Senator McCain\u2019s plan, those rules would be stripped away and you would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherry-picking and excluding people from coverage. That, I think, is a mistake and I think that this is a fundamental difference in our campaign and how we would approach health care."}

I want to clarify it briefly if I can. The first thing is the tax relief program that we\u2019ve proposed, one of the many tax credits for the middle class includes a $500 tax credit for stay-at-home moms just as a way of saying we understand that you are performing a service for our society. We want you to have that tax credit. Second, the number of 50 million Americans not benefitting from our tax cut program is absolutely wrong. It\u2019s an estimate done on an earlier form of our tax cut program and it\u2019s just plain wrong. And secondly, although Governor Bush says that his tax cut program, large as it is, gives a tax cut to everybody, as the newspapers indicated earlier this week, the Joint Committee on Taxation, again a nonpartisan group in Congress, says that 27 million Americans don\u2019t get what the governor said they would in the tax program. Al Gore and I want to live within our means. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to give it all away in one big tax cut and certainly not to the 1% of the public that doesn\u2019t need it now. We\u2019re focusing our tax cut on the middle class in the areas they tell us they need it. Tax credits for better and more expensive child care, tax credits for middle class families that don\u2019t have health insurance from their employers. The tax deduction I talked about earlier. Very exciting deduction for up to $10,000 a year in the cost of a college tuition. A $3,000 tax credit for the cost \u2014 well, actually for a family member who stays home with a parent or grandparent who is ill. And a very exciting tax credit program that I hope I\u2019ll have a chance to talk about later, Bernie, that encourages savings by people early in life and any time in life by having the federal government match savings for the 75 million Americans who make $100,000 or less up to $2,000 a year. Very briefly, if a young couple making $50,000 a year saves $1,000, the government will put another $1,000 in that account.

I think you know that these last four years haven\u2019t been so good as the president just described and that you don\u2019t feel like your confident that the next four years are going to be much better either. I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what you\u2019re going to get. You\u2019re going to get a repeat of the last four years. We just can\u2019t afford four more years like the last four years. He said that by now we\u2019d have unemployment at 5.4 percent. The difference between where it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million Americans without work. I wasn\u2019t the one that said 5.4 percent. This was the president\u2019s plan. Didn\u2019t get there. He said he would have by now put forward a plan to reform Medicare and Social Security, because he pointed out they\u2019re on the road to bankruptcy. He would reform them. He\u2019d get that done. He hasn\u2019t even made a proposal on either one. He said in his first year he\u2019d put out an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges. Didn\u2019t even file it. This is a president who has not been able to do what he said he\u2019d do. He said that he\u2019d cut in half the deficit. He hasn\u2019t done that either. In fact, he doubled it. He said that by now middle-income families would have a reduction in their health insurance premiums by $2,500 a year. It\u2019s gone up by $2,500 a year. And if Obamacare is passed, or implemented \u2014 it\u2019s already been passed \u2014 if it\u2019s implemented fully, it\u2019ll be another $2,500 on top. The middle class is getting crushed under the policies of a president who has not understood what it takes to get the economy working again. He keeps saying, \u201cLook, I\u2019ve created 5 million jobs.\u201d That\u2019s after losing 5 million jobs. The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country. The unemployment, the number of people who are still looking for work, is still 23 million Americans. There are more people in poverty, one out of six people in poverty. How about food stamps? When he took office, 32 million people were on food stamps. Today, 47 million people are on food stamps. How about the growth of the economy? It\u2019s growing more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before. The president wants to do well. I understand. But the policies he\u2019s put in place from Obamacare to Dodd-Frank to his tax policies to his regulatory policies, these policies combined have not let this economy take off and grow like it could have. You might say, \u201cWell, you got an example of one that worked better?\u201d Yeah, in the Reagan recession where unemployment hit 10.8 percent, between that period \u2014 the end of that recession and the equivalent of time to today, Ronald Reagan\u2019s recovery created twice as many jobs as this president\u2019s recovery. Five million jobs doesn\u2019t even keep up with our population growth. And the only reason the unemployment rate seems a little lower today is because of all the people that have dropped out of the workforce. The president has tried, but his policies haven\u2019t worked. He\u2019s great as a \u2014 as a \u2014 as a speaker and describing his plans and his vision. That\u2019s wonderful, except we have a record to look at. And that record shows he just hasn\u2019t been able to cut the deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare and Social Security to preserve them, to get us the rising incomes we need. Median income is down $4,300 a family and 23 million Americans out of work. That\u2019s what this election is about. It\u2019s about who can get the middle class in this country a bright and prosperous future and assure our kids the kind of hope and optimism they deserve."}

So let me try to answer you in this way. Let\u2019s start with a premise. We spend 30% more of our income than any nation on earth on health care, and yet we insure fewer people. We have 35 million people without any insurance at all \u2014 and I see them all the time. A hundred thousand Americans a month have lost their health insurance just in the last 4 years. So if you analyze where we\u2019re out of line with other countries, you come up with the following conclusions. Number one, we spend at least $60 billion a year on insurance, administrative cost, bureaucracy, and government regulation that wouldn\u2019t be spent in any other nation. So we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everybody. Employers would cover their employees, government would cover the unemployed. Number 2, I think you have to take on specifically the insurance companies and require them to make some significant change in the way they rate people in the big community pools. I think you have to tell the pharmaceutical companies they can\u2019t keep raising drug prices at three times the rate of inflation. I think you have to take on medical fraud. I think you have to help doctors stop practicing defensive medicine. I\u2019ve recommended that our doctors be given a set of national practice guidelines and that if they follow those guidelines that raises the presumption that they didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I think you have to have a system of primary and preventive clinics in our inner cities and our rural areas so people can have access to health care. The key is to control the cost and maintain the quality. To do that you need a system of managed competition where all of us are covered in big groups and we can choose our doctors and our hospitals, a wide range, but there is an incentive to control costs. And I think there has to be \u2014 I think Mr. Perot and I agree on this, there has to be a national commission of health care providers and health care consumers that set ceilings to keep health costs in line with inflation, plus population growth. Now, let me say, some people say we can\u2019t do this but Hawaii does it. They cover 98% of their people and their insurance premiums are much cheaper than the rest of America, and so does Rochester, New York. They now have a plan to cover everybody and their premiums are two-thirds of the rest of the country. This is very important. It\u2019s a big human problem and a devastating economic problem for America, and I\u2019m going to send a plan to do this within the first 100 days of my presidency. It\u2019s terribly important."}

Let me tell you what I\u2019m actually going to do. I think tax policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself. And we both want to cut taxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes for. Now, Senator McCain, the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in America. Exxon Mobil, and other oil companies, for example, would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks. What I\u2019ve said is I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of working Americans, 95 percent. If you make more \u2014 if you make less than a quarter million dollars a year, then you will not see your income tax go up, your capital gains tax go up, your payroll tax. Not one dime. And 95 percent of working families, 95 percent of you out there, will get a tax cut. In fact, independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than Senator McCain does. Now, the conversation I had with Joe the plumber, what I essentially said to him was, \u201cFive years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then.\u201d And what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who doesn\u2019t yet have money, I want to give them a tax break now. And that requires us to make some important choices. The last point I\u2019ll make about small businesses. Not only do 98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000, but I also want to give them additional tax breaks, because they are the drivers of the economy. They produce the most jobs."}

I\u2019ve done it. We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures. And we used \u2013 yes, we used \u2013 the Senate Budget Committee\u2019s projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5% \u2013 which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated. And eliminated probably more quickly than our plan, but we wanted to be so conservative with it, that people would see how. how well it could be done. Now, John\u2019s been in the Congress for 20 years. And John tells us that first, we\u2019ve got to reduce spending before we can reduce taxes. Well, if you\u2019ve got a kid that\u2019s extravagant, you can lecture him all you want to about his extravagance. Or you can cut his allowance and achieve the same end much quicker. But Government has never reduced Government does not tax to get the money it needs. Government always needs the money it gets. And when John talks about his non-inflationary plan, as far as I have been able to learn, there are 88 proposals in it that call for additional Government spending programs. Now, I speak with some confidence of our plan, because I took over a state \u2013 California \u2013 10% of the population of this nation \u2013 a state that, if it were a nation, would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world. And that state we controlled spending. We cut the rate of increase in spending in half. But at the same time, we gave back to the people of California \u2013 in tax rebates, tax credits, tax cuts \u2013 $5.7 billion. I vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned. And among those vetoes, I stopped $16 billion in additional spending. And the funny thing was that California, which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment, for those six years for the first time, was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment. We have considered inflation in our figures. We deliberately took figures that we, ourselves, believed were too conservative. I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983, and it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s counting on for his plan. But he\u2019s going to get a half-a-trillion dollars more over the next five years that he can use for additional programs, or hopefully, someplace down the line, balancing the budget.

The present tax structure is a disgrace to this country; it\u2019s just a welfare program for the rich. As a matter of fact, uh \u2013 25 percent of the total tax deductions, go for only 1 percent of the richest people in this country, and over 50 percent of the tax uh credits go for the 14 percent of the richest people in this country. When Mr. Ford first became president in \u2013 in August of 1974, the first thing he did in \u2013 in October was to ask for a $4.7 billion increase in taxes on our people in the midst of the heaviest recession, since uh \u2013 since the great depression of nineteen uh \u2013 of the 1940s. In uh \u2013 January of 1975 he asked for a tax change: a $5.6 billion increase on low-and-middle-income private individuals, a six and a half billion dollar decrease on the corporations and the special interests. In uh \u2013 December of uh \u2013 1975 he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion dollar uh tax-reduction bill that had been passed by the Congress, and then he came back later on in January of this year and he did advocate a $10 billion tax reduction, but it would be offset by a $6 billion increase this coming January in deductions for Social Security payments and for unemployment compensation. The whole philosophy of the Republican party, including uh \u2013 my opponent, has been to pile on taxes on low-income people to take \u2019em off on the corporations. As a matter fact, in \u2013 sin- since the late sixties when Mr. Nixon took office, we\u2019ve had a reduction in uh \u2013 in the percentage of taxes paid by corporations from 30 percent down to about 20 percent. We\u2019ve had an increase in taxes paid by individuals, payroll taxes, from14 Percent up to 20 percent. And this is what the Republicans have done to us. And this is why a tax reform is so important."}

We\u2019re going to have a lot of work to do, so I can\u2019t guarantee that we\u2019re going to do it in the next two years, but I\u2019d like to do in the my first term as president. But I think it\u2019s important to understand, we\u2019re not going to solve Social Security and Medicare unless we understand the rest of our tax policies. And you know, Senator McCain, I think the \u201cStraight Talk Express\u201d lost a wheel on that one. So let\u2019s be clear about my tax plan and Senator McCain\u2019s, because we\u2019re not going to be able to deal with entitlements unless we understand the revenues coming in. I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of Americans, 95 percent. If you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year, you will not see a single dime of your taxes go up. If you make $200,000 a year or less, your taxes will go down. Now, Senator McCain talks about small businesses. Only a few percent of small businesses make more than $250,000 a year. So the vast majority of small businesses would get a tax cut under my plan. And we provide a 50 percent tax credit so that they can buy health insurance for their workers, because there are an awful lot of small businesses that I meet across America that want to do right by their workers but they just can\u2019t afford it. Some small business owners, a lot of them, can\u2019t even afford health insurance for themselves. Now, in contrast, Senator McCain wants to give a $300 billion tax cut, $200 billion of it to the largest corporations and a hundred thousand of it \u2014 a hundred billion of it going to people like CEOs on Wall Street. He wants to give average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts. That is not fair. And it doesn\u2019t work. Now, if we get our tax policies right so that they\u2019re good for the middle class, if we reverse the policies of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place and that Senator McCain supported, then we are going to be in a position to deal with Social Security and deal with Medicare, because we will have a health care plan that actually works for you, reduces spending and costs over the long term, and Social Security that is stable and solvent for all Americans and not just some."}

As a matter of fact, it is the economic recovery program that we presented when I took office in 1981. It is true that earlier, working with some very prominent economists, I had come up, during the campaign, with an economic program that I thought could rectify the great problems confronting us \u2014 the double-digit inflation, the high tax rates that I think were hurting the economy, the stagflation that we were undergoing. Before even the election day, something that none of those economists had even predicted had happened, that the economy was so worsened that I was openly saying that what we had thought on the basis of our plan could have brought a balanced budget \u2014 no, that was no longer possible. So, the plan that we have had and that we are following is a plan that is based on growth in the economy, recovery without inflation, and reducing the share that the Government is taking from the gross national product, which has become a drag on the economy. Already, we have a recovery that has been going on for about 21 months to the point that we can now call it an expansion. Under that, this year, we have seen a $21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year, based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates. Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery. We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was. The interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points and, we think, must come down further. In the last 21 months, more than 6 million people have gotten jobs \u2014 there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working, where there were only 99 million before; 107, if you count the military. So, we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending \u2014 the increase, rate of increase in government spending, which has come down from 17 to 6 percent, and, at the same time, as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets, without raising taxes, those two lines will meet.

They promised they were going to put $2 trillion of the surplus aside from Social Security. Not done. Not only that, it\u2019s the biggest fiscal turnaround in American history. And there\u2019s no end in sight. The Washington Post just reported they have several trillion dollars of additional tax cuts and spending, no suggestion of what they\u2019re going to do about it.

We want to keep the tax cuts that are in place for people who make less than $200,000 a year and give additional tax cuts to those middle-class families, tax cuts for health care, tax cuts to help families pay for their college tuition, tax cuts for child care. These families are struggling and hurting, and they need more tax relief, not less tax relief.

It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that. You tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful. But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan.

I want to give people permanent incentives on investment tax credit, like President Kennedy and the Congress inaugurated in the early \u201960s to get industry moving again; a research and development tax credit; a low-income housing tax credit; a long-term capital gains proposal for new business and business expansions. We\u2019ve got to have no more trickle down. We don\u2019t need across-the-board tax cuts for the wealthy for nothing. We need to say here\u2019s your tax incentive: if you create American jobs, the old-fashioned way. I\u2019d like to create more millionaires than were created under Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan, but I don\u2019t want to have 4 years where we have no growth in the private sector, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happened in the last 4 years. We\u2019re down 35,000 jobs in the private sector. We need to invest and grow, and that\u2019s what I want to do."}

One called it fiction. The other called it untrue. The fact is that my health-care plan, America, is very simple. It gives you the choice. I don\u2019t force you to do anything. It\u2019s not a government plan. The government doesn\u2019t require you to do anything. You choose your doctor. You choose your plan. If you don\u2019t want to take the offer of the plan that I want to put forward, you don\u2019t have do. You can keep what you have today, keep a high deductible, keep high premiums, keep a high co-pay, keep low benefits. But I got a better plan. And I don\u2019t think a lot of people are going to want to keep what they have today. Here\u2019s what I do: We take over Medicaid children from the states so that every child in America is covered. And in exchange, if the states want to \u2014 they\u2019re not forced to, they can choose to \u2014 they cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty. It\u2019s their choice. I think they\u2019ll choose it, because it\u2019s a net plus of $5 billion to them. We allow you \u2014 if you choose to, you don\u2019t have to \u2014 but we give you broader competition to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that senators and congressmen give themselves. If it\u2019s good enough for us, it\u2019s good enough for every American. I believe that your health care is just as important as any politician in Washington, D. C. You want to buy into it, you can. We give you broader competition. That helps lower prices. In addition to that, we\u2019re going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early. And most importantly, we give small business a 50 percent tax credit so that after we lower the costs of health care, they also get, whether they\u2019re self-employed or a small business, a lower cost to be able to cover their employees. Now, what happens is when you begin to get people covered like that \u2014 for instance in diabetes, if you diagnose diabetes early, you could save $50 billion in the health care system of America by avoiding surgery and dialysis. It works. And I\u2019m going to offer it to America."}

It is breaking family budgets. I can\u2019t tell you how many people I meet who don\u2019t have health insurance. If you\u2019ve got health insurance, most of you have seen your premiums double over the last eight years. And your co-payments and deductibles have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alone. If you\u2019re a small business, it\u2019s a crushing burden. So one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing. So here\u2019s what I would do. If you\u2019ve got health care already, and probably the majority of you do, then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it. You can keep your choice of doctor. We\u2019re going to work with your employer to lower the cost of your premiums by up to $2,500 a year. And we\u2019re going to do it by investing in prevention. We\u2019re going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital. That will reduce medical errors and reduce costs. If you don\u2019t have health insurance, you\u2019re going to be able to buy the same kind of insurance that Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees. Because there\u2019s a huge pool, we can drop the costs. And nobody will be excluded for pre-existing conditions, which is a huge problem. Now, Senator McCain has a different kind of approach. He says that he\u2019s going to give you a $5,000 tax credit. What he doesn\u2019t tell you is that he is going to tax your employer-based health care benefits for the first time ever. So what one hand giveth, the other hand taketh away. He would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure you\u2019re not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered. And that is fundamentally the wrong way to go. In fact, just today business organizations like the United States Chamber of Commerce, which generally are pretty supportive of Republicans, said that this would lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system. That, I don\u2019t think, is the kind of change that we need. We\u2019ve got to have somebody who is fighting for patients and making sure that you get decent, affordable health care. And that\u2019s something that I\u2019m committed to doing as president."}

So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share. We\u2019re going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country. That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs. By contrast, Donald\u2019s plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs. Why? Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids.

In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960. What I have talked about, however, the kind of programs that I\u2019ve talked about, in my judgment, are uh \u2013 fiscally sound. Medical care for the aged, I would put under social security. The Vice President and I disagree on this. The program \u2013 the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon-Javits program \u2013 would have cost, if fully used uh \u2013 six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state. The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security, and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax. Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers\u2019 salaries. I think that\u2019s a good investment. I think we\u2019re going to have to do it. And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated. There is no greater return to an economy or to a society than an educational system second to none. On the question of the development of natural resources, I would pay as you go in the sense that they would be balanced and the power revenues would bring back sufficient money to finance the projects, in the same way as the Tennessee Valley. I believe in the balanced budget. And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession. Otherwise, with a steady rate of economic growth \u2013 and Mr. Nixon and Mr. Rockefeller, in their meeting, said a five per cent economic growth would bring by 1962 ten billion dollars extra in tax revenues. Whatever is brought in, I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget, if business remains orderly."}

There you go again.  I don\u2019t have a plan to tax \u2014 or increase taxes. I\u2019m not going to increase taxes. I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes. Now, I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed; it\u2019s that government is overfed. And I think that most of our people \u2014 this is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up. And, as a matter of fact, it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes, those above $50,000 actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage-wise as did those from 50,000 down. From 50,000 down, those people paid two-thirds of the taxes, and those people got two-thirds of the tax cut. Now, the Social Security tax of \u201977 \u2014 this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest. It had two features. It had several tax increases phased in over a period of time \u2014 there are two more yet to come between now and 1989. At the same time every year, it increased the amount of money \u2014 virtually every year, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there \u2014 that was subject to that tax. Today it is up to about $38,000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for Social Security. And that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, 20 \u2014 they\u2019re paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money. Now, I don\u2019t think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesn\u2019t work out that way. The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as I\u2019ve said, and that has not been changed. But if you take it in numbers of dollars instead of percentage, yes, you could say, well, that person got 10 times as much as this other person. Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also. But if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board."}

The place where we\u2019ve seen manufacturing go has been China. China is now the largest manufacturer in the world. It used to be the United States of America. A lot of good people have lost jobs. A half a million manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last four years. That\u2019s total over the last four years. One of the reasons for that is that people think it\u2019s more attractive in some cases to go offshore than to stay here. We have made it less attractive for enterprises to stay here than to go offshore from time to time. What I will do as president is make sure it\u2019s more attractive to come to America again. This is the way we\u2019re going to create jobs in this country. It\u2019s not by trickle-down government, saying we\u2019re going to take more money from people and hire more government workers, raise more taxes, put in place more regulations. Trickle-down government has never worked here, has never worked anywhere. I want to make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for small business, for big business, to invest and grow in America. Now, we\u2019re going to have to make sure that as we trade with other nations that they play by the rules. And China hasn\u2019t. One of the reasons \u2014 or one of the ways they don\u2019t play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency. Because if they put their currency down low, that means their prices on their goods are low. And that makes them advantageous in the marketplace. We lose sales. And manufacturers here in the U.S. making the same products can\u2019t compete. China has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years. And the president has a regular opportunity to label them as a currency manipulator, but refuses to do so. On day one, I will label China a currency manipulator, which will allow me as president to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers. So we\u2019re going to make sure that people we trade with around the world play by the rules. But let me \u2014 let me not just stop there. Don\u2019t forget, what\u2019s key to bringing back jobs here is not just finding someone else to punish, and I\u2019m going to be strict with people who we trade with to make sure they \u2014 they follow the law and play by the rules, but it\u2019s also to make America the most attractive place in the world for businesses of all kinds. That\u2019s why I want to down the tax rates on small employers, big employers, so they want to be here. Canada\u2019s tax rate on companies is now 15 percent. Ours is 35 percent. So if you\u2019re starting a business, where would you rather start it? We have to be competitive if we\u2019re going to create more jobs here. Regulations have quadrupled. The rate of regulations quadrupled under this president. I talk to small businesses across the country. They say, \u201cWe feel like we\u2019re under attack from our own government.\u201d I want to make sure that regulators see their job as encouraging small business, not crushing it. And there\u2019s no question but that Obamacare has been an extraordinary deterrent to enterprises of all kinds hiring people. My priority is making sure that we get more people hired. If we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country, then you\u2019re going to see rising incomes again. The reason incomes are down is because unemployment is so high. I know what it takes to get this to happen, and my plan will do that, and one part of it is to make sure that we keep China playing by the rules."}

Part of my tax package which is paid for in my balanced budget plan would exempt up to half a million dollars in gains from people when they sell their homes, which I think is the biggest capital gains benefit we could give to most ordinary Americans. We also have capital gains now for people that invest in new small businesses and hold the investment for five years. It was part of our other economic plan. And these are things I think that will go a long way toward helping America build a stronger economy and a better tax system. I think the most important thing to emphasize, though, is that we also have to help people in other ways to build a strong economy and we can\u2019t have any tax cut that\u2019s not paid for. One of the big differences between Senator Dole and myself is that I told you how I\u2019m going to pay for every penny of the tax cuts I recommend and we\u2019ve worked hard to bring this deficit down and that\u2019s helped people in the real estate business because the interest rates are lower. We\u2019ve got home ownership at a 15-year high. We\u2019ve got this country going in the right direction. So we can have a tax cut but my priority would be to help the families who need it with child rearing and education and buying a first-time home and helping for health care costs. So from your business, helping in buying a first-time home, exempting the capital gains on the sale of the home would be the most important things that you asked about. Thank you, Pamela."}

And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis. And despite that, what we\u2019ve said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn\u2019t slip into a Great Depression, but what we\u2019ve also said is, let\u2019s make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow. So 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but weren\u2019t working very well, 18 government \u2014 18 government programs for education that were well-intentioned, not weren\u2019t helping kids learn, we went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars, $50 billion of waste taken out of the system. And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget. That\u2019s the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower. Now, we all know that we\u2019ve got to do more. And so I\u2019ve put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan. It\u2019s on a website. You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise. And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit. Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission. Well, that\u2019s how the commission \u2014 bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts. And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have. Let \u2014 let me just finish their point, because you\u2019re looking for contrast. You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue? And he said no. Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education. It means that Governor Romney\u2026 \u2026 talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities."}

Senator Kennedy. First of all, I think it is well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the Soviet Union in this whole matter of growth. The Soviet Union has been moving faster than we have. But the reason for that is obvious. They start from a much lower base. Although they have been moving faster in growth than we have, we find, for example, today that their total gross national product is only forty-four per cent of our total gross national product. That\u2019s the same percentage that it was twenty years ago. And as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago. Is this any reason for complacency? Not at all Because these are determined men. They are fanatical men. And we have to get the very most of uh \u2013 out uh \u2013 out of our economy. I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score. Where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy. I respectfully submit that Senator Kennedy too often would rely too much on the federal government, on what it would do to solve our problems, to stimulate growth. I believe that when we examine the Democratic platform, when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight, when we compare them with the proposals that I have made, that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that I have advocated. There are many of the points that he has made that I would like to comment upon. The one in the field of health is worth mentioning. Our health program \u2013 the one that Senator Javits and other Republican Senators, as well as I supported \u2013 is one that provides for all people over sixty-five who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it. It provides a choice of having either government insurance or private insurance. But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it. His program under Social Security, would require everybody who had Social Security to take government health insurance whether he wanted it or not. And it would not cover several million people who are not covered by Social Security at all. Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his. The other point that I would make is this: this downgrading of how much things cost I think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when \u2013 during the Truman Administration when the government was spending more than it took in \u2013 we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation. We found the people who could least afford it \u2013 people on retired incomes uh \u2013 people on fixed incomes \u2013 we found them unable to meet their bills at the end of the month. It is essential that a man who\u2019s president of this country certainly stand for every program that will mean for growth. And I stand for programs that will mean growth and progress. But it is also essential that he not allow a dollar spent that could be better spent by the people themselves."}

They produce the most jobs.","Dimension Description":"Dimension 2 - Negative Pole - t001689 - Dimension Description:\n1. **Collective Responsibility and Supportive Governance**: This opposing view emphasizes a collective approach to societal well-being, with a belief in shared responsibility for individual success and security. Rather than emphasizing personal self-sufficiency, it advocates for robust social support systems, progressive tax policies, and wealth redistribution to foster equity. Government assistance is seen as essential to ensuring that all individuals have the resources and opportunities necessary for personal success.\n2. **Economic Progressivism and Fair Regulation**: This ideology argues for active governmental involvement in economic regulation and corporate accountability, with a focus on fair labor standards, social safety nets, and environmental protections. It views corporate regulation, higher taxation on the wealthy, and redistributive policies as necessary to reduce inequality, stimulate equitable growth, and protect public interests over private profits.\n3. **Global Cooperation and Inclusive Security**: Instead of prioritizing strict border controls and stringent immigration laws, this perspective advocates for open, humane immigration policies and global collaboration. National security is pursued through diplomatic partnerships, humanitarian aid, and policies that recognize the contributions of immigrants to societal progress, rather than framing immigration as a threat.\n4. **Progressive and Inclusive Cultural Values**: This ideology supports diversity, inclusivity, and cultural dynamism, viewing social change and multiculturalism as vital to a thriving society. Rather than seeing immigration and cultural differences as threats, it celebrates them as sources of strength, promoting policies that encourage integration, mutual respect, and equal opportunities for all demographic groups.\n5. **Proactive and Preventative Governance**: Contrary to a crisis-driven approach, this ideology supports proactive measures in public health, climate resilience, and social welfare to prevent crises before they arise. Government intervention is seen as essential to preempt economic and social challenges through policies that prioritize sustainable development, social protections, and community resilience over reactive law enforcement.\n6. **Support for Progressive Social and Economic Policies**: This view champions progressive reforms like universal healthcare, accessible welfare programs, and comprehensive immigration reform. It supports economic policies that address systemic inequalities and strengthen community welfare, including programs that aid vulnerable populations and promote equal access to resources as a means of reinforcing national unity and integrity.\nOverall, this opposite pole reflects an **inclusive, cooperative worldview** where collective well-being, governmental responsibility, and progressive values drive policy decisions. Economic equity, cultural inclusivity, and proactive social policies are prioritized, with government intervention viewed positively in advancing shared prosperity, security, and societal harmony.","Text":"You know, when Senator Obama ended up his conversation with Joe the plumber \u2014 we need to spread the wealth around.

Government assistance is seen as essential to ensuring that all individuals have the resources and opportunities necessary for personal success.\n2. **Economic Progressivism and Fair Regulation**: This ideology argues for active governmental involvement in economic regulation and corporate accountability, with a focus on fair labor standards, social safety nets, and environmental protections. It views corporate regulation, higher taxation on the wealthy, and redistributive policies as necessary to reduce inequality, stimulate equitable growth, and protect public interests over private profits.\n3. **Global Cooperation and Inclusive Security**: Instead of prioritizing strict border controls and stringent immigration laws, this perspective advocates for open, humane immigration policies and global collaboration. National security is pursued through diplomatic partnerships, humanitarian aid, and policies that recognize the contributions of immigrants to societal progress, rather than framing immigration as a threat.\n4. **Progressive and Inclusive Cultural Values**: This ideology supports diversity, inclusivity, and cultural dynamism, viewing social change and multiculturalism as vital to a thriving society. Rather than seeing immigration and cultural differences as threats, it celebrates them as sources of strength, promoting policies that encourage integration, mutual respect, and equal opportunities for all demographic groups.\n5. **Proactive and Preventative Governance**: Contrary to a crisis-driven approach, this ideology supports proactive measures in public health, climate resilience, and social welfare to prevent crises before they arise. Government intervention is seen as essential to preempt economic and social challenges through policies that prioritize sustainable development, social protections, and community resilience over reactive law enforcement.\n6. **Support for Progressive Social and Economic Policies**: This view champions progressive reforms like universal healthcare, accessible welfare programs, and comprehensive immigration reform. It supports economic policies that address systemic inequalities and strengthen community welfare, including programs that aid vulnerable populations and promote equal access to resources as a means of reinforcing national unity and integrity.\nOverall, this opposite pole reflects an **inclusive, cooperative worldview** where collective well-being, governmental responsibility, and progressive values drive policy decisions. Economic equity, cultural inclusivity, and proactive social policies are prioritized, with government intervention viewed positively in advancing shared prosperity, security, and societal harmony.","Text":"It is\u2014our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster."}

It argues for a policy of minimal intervention in other nations\u2019 affairs, advocating respect for their sovereignty and self-determination rather than imposing democratic values.\n2. **Relativism in Political Ideals**: Freedom and democracy are viewed as culturally specific ideals rather than universal absolutes. This perspective opposes the notion that the U.S. should promote its political system worldwide and instead supports a diverse range of governance styles, including authoritarian regimes, as legitimate choices for other nations.\n3. **Self-Reliance and Domestic Unity over Global Alliances**: Rather than focusing on alignment with allies, this dimension prioritizes strengthening internal cohesion and self-sufficiency. The ideology suggests that national security comes from a stable domestic foundation, placing less emphasis on global unity or military alliances and preferring a focus on localized preparedness and economic independence.\n4. **Pragmatic Use of Resources over Competitive Supremacy**: This stance questions the need for economic and technological dominance on a global scale. It promotes a balanced approach to economic growth and technology that serves domestic welfare, with less emphasis on surpassing other nations. Strategic assets are directed inwardly to address social needs rather than being leveraged for international influence.\n5. **Diplomacy and Compromise as Paths to Peace**: Opposing the \u201cpeace through strength\u201d doctrine, this philosophy supports diplomatic negotiations, compromise, and multilateral cooperation to prevent conflicts. It emphasizes peace-building through collaborative international efforts rather than through military power or deterrence, viewing a conciliatory approach as more sustainable for global stability.\n6. **Flexible Identity and Reassessment of Global Role**: Rather than viewing America\u2019s international leadership as historically necessary, this perspective advocates for a redefined role that is responsive to current global realities. It suggests reassessing traditional missions and focusing on pragmatic, issue-based involvement, resisting the idea that U.S. identity is bound to a vigilant defense of global democracy or ideological confrontation.\nThese opposing beliefs promote an ideology centered on non-intervention, respect for diverse political systems, prioritization of domestic resilience, a balanced approach to technological growth, diplomatic compromise, and a reassessment of America\u2019s global role focused on selective, practical engagement.","Text":"Mr. Howe, Mr. Vice President. First uh \u2013 let me again try to correct the record on the matter of Quemoy and Matsu. I voted for the Formosa resolution in 1955. I have sustained it since then. I\u2019ve said that I agree with the Administration policy. Mr. Nixon earlier indicated that he would defend Quemoy and Matsu even if the attack on these islands, two miles off the coast of China, were not part of a general attack an Formosa and the Pescadores. I indicated that I would defend those islands if the attack were directed against Pescadores and Formosa, which is part of the Eisenhower policy. I\u2019ve supported that policy. In the last week, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have re-read the testimony of General Twining representing the Administration in 1959, and the Assistant Secretary of State before the Foreign Relations Committee in 1958, and I have accurately described the Administration policy, and I support it wholeheartedly. So that really isn\u2019t an issue in this campaign. It isn\u2019t an issue with Mr. Nixon, who now says that he also supports the Eisenhower policy. Nor is the question that all Americans want peace and security an issue in this campaign. The question is: are we moving in the direction of peace and security? Is our relative strength growing? Is, as Mr. Nixon says, our prestige at an all-time high, as he said a week ago, and that of the Communists at an all-time low? I don\u2019t believe it is. I don\u2019t believe that our relative strength is increasing. And I say that not as the Democratic standard-bearer, but as a citizen of the United States who is concerned about the United States. I look at Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States. In 1957 I was in Havana. I talked to the American Ambassador there. He said that he was the second most powerful man in Cuba. And yet even though Ambassador Smith and Ambassador Gardner, both Republican Ambassadors, both warned of Castro, the Marxist influences around Castro, the Communist influences around Castro, both of them have testified in the last six weeks, that in spite of their warnings to the American government, nothing was done. Our d- security depends upon Latin America. Can any American looking at the situation in Latin America feel contented with what\u2019s happening today, when a candidate for the presidency of Brazil feels it necessary to call \u2013 not on Washington during the campaign \u2013 but on Castro in Havana, in order to pick up the support of the Castro supporters in Brazil? At the American Conference \u2013 Inter-American Conference this summer, when we wanted them to join together in the denunciation of Castro and the Cuban Communists, we couldn\u2019t even get the Inter-American group to join together in denouncing Castro. It was rather a vague statement that they finally made. Do you know today that the Com- the Russians broadcast ten times as many programs in Spanish to Latin America as we do? Do you know we don\u2019t have a single program sponsored by our government to Cuba \u2013 to tell them our story, to tell them that we are their friends, that we want them to be free again? Africa is now the emerging area of the world. It contains twenty-five percent of all the members of the General Assembly. We didn\u2019t even have a Bureau of African Affairs until 1957. In the Africa south of the Sahara, which is the major new section, we have less students from all of Africa in that area studying under government auspices today than from the country of Thailand. If there\u2019s one thing Africa needs it\u2019s technical assistance. And yet last year we gave them less than five percent of all the technical assistance funds that we distributed around the world. We relied in the Middle East on the Baghdad Pact, and yet when the Iraqi Government was changed, the Baghdad Pact broke down. We relied on the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Middle East, which passed the Senate. There isn\u2019t one country in the Middle East that now endorses the Eisenhower Doctrine. We look to Europe uh \u2013 to Asia because the struggle is in the underdeveloped world. Which system, Communism or freedom, will triumph in the next five or ten years? That\u2019s what should concern us, not the history of ten, or fifteen, or twenty years ago. But are we doing enough in these areas? What are freedom\u2019s chances in those areas? By 1965 or 1970, will there be other Cubas in Latin America? Will Guinea and Ghana, which have now voted with the Communists frequently as newly independent countries of Africa \u2013 will there be others? Will the Congo go Communist? Will other countries? Are we doing enough in that area? And what about Asia? Is India going to win the economic struggle or is China going to win it? Who will dominate Asia in the next five or ten years? Communism? The Chinese? Or will freedom? The question which we have to decide as Americans \u2013 are we doing enough today? Is our strength and prestige rising? Do people want to be identified with us? Do they want to follow United States leadership? I don\u2019t think they do, enough. And that\u2019s what concerns me. In Africa \u2013 these countries that have newly joined the United Nations. On the question of admission of Red China, only two countries in all of Africa voted with us \u2013 Liberia and the Union of South Africa. The rest either abstained or voted against us. More countries in Asia voted against us on that question than voted with us. I believe that this struggle is going to go on, and it may be well decided in the next decade. I have seen Cuba go to the Communists. I have seen Communist influence and Castro influence rise in Latin America. I have seen us ignore Africa. There are six countries in Africa that are members of the United Nations. There isn\u2019t a single American diplomatic representative in any of those six. When Guinea became independent, the Soviet Ambassador showed up that very day. We didn\u2019t recognize them for two months; the American Ambassador didn\u2019t show up for nearly eight months. I believe that the world is changing fast. And I don\u2019t think this Administration has shown the foresight, has shown the knowledge, has been identified with the great fight which these people are waging to be free, to get a better standard of living, to live better. The average income in some of those countries is twenty-five dollars a year. The Communists say, \u201cCome with us; look what we\u2019ve done.\u201d And we\u2019ve been in \u2013 on the whole, uninterested. I think we\u2019re going to have to do better. Mr. Nixon talks about our being the strongest country in the world. I think we are today. But we were far stronger relative to the Communists five years ago, and what is of great concern is that the balance of power is in danger of moving with them. They made a breakthrough in missiles, and by nineteen sixty-one, two, and three, they will be outnumbering us in missiles. I\u2019m not as confident as he is that we will be the strongest military power by 1963. He talks about economic growth as a great indicator of freedom. I agree with him. What we do in this country, the kind of society that we build, that will tell whether freedom will be sustained around the world. And yet, in the last nine months of this year, we\u2019ve had a drop in our economic growth rather than a gain. We\u2019ve had the lowest rate of increase of economic growth in the last nine months of any major industrialized society in the world. I look up and see the Soviet flag on the moon. The fact is that the State Department polls on our prestige and influence around the world have shown such a sharp drop that up till now the State Department has been unwilling to release them. And yet they were polled by the U.S.I.A. The point of all this is, this is a struggle in which we\u2019re engaged. We want peace. We want freedom. We want security. We want to be stronger. We want freedom to gain. But I don\u2019t believe in these changing and revolutionary times this Administration has known that the world is changing \u2013 has identified itself with that change. I think the Communists have been moving with vigor \u2013 Laos, Africa, Cuba \u2013 all around the world today they\u2019re on the move. I think we have to revita1ize our society. I think we have to demonstrate to the people of the world that we\u2019re determined in this free country of ours to be first \u2013 not first if, and not first but, and not first when \u2013 but first. And when we are strong and when we are first, then freedom gains; then the prospects for peace increase; then the prospects for our society gain."}

Since this campaign began I have had a very rare privilege. I have traveled to forty-eight of the fifty states and in my travels I have learned what the people of the United States are thinking about. There is one issue that stands out above all the rest, one in which every American is concerned, regardless of what group he may be a member and regardless of where he may live. And that issue, very simply stated, is this: how can we keep the peace \u2013 keep it without surrender? How can we extend freedom \u2013 extend it without war? Now in determining how we deal with this issue, we must find the answer to a very important but simple question: who threatens the peace? Who threatens freedom in the world? There is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom \u2013 that that is presented by the international Communist movement. And therefore if we are to have peace, we must know how to deal with the Communists and their leaders. I know Mr. Khrushchev. I also have had the opportunity of knowing and meeting other Communist leaders in the world. I believe there are certain principles we must find in dealing with him and his colleagues \u2013 principles, if followed, that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom. First, we have to learn from the past, because we cannot afford to make the mistakes of the past. In the seven years before this Administration came into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain. And at the end of that seven years we were engaged in a war in Korea which cost of thirty thousand American lives. In the past seven years, in President Eisenhower\u2019s Administration, this situation has been reversed. We ended the Korean War; by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars; and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table. Now why were we successful, as our predecessors were not successful? I think there\u2019re several reasons. In the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the Communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world. One of the major errors they made was the one that led to the Korean War. In ruling out the defense of Korea, they invited aggression in that area. They thought they were going to have peace \u2013 it brought war. We learned from their mistakes. And so, in our seven years, we find that we have been firm in our diplomacy; we have never made concessions without getting concessions in return. We have always been willing to go the extra mile to negotiate for disarmament or in any other area. But we have never been willing to do anything that, in effect, surrendered freedom any place in the world. That is why President Eisenhower was correct in not apologizing or expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev at the Paris Conference, as Senator Kennedy suggested he could have done. That is why Senator wh- President Eisenhower was also correct in his policy in the Formosa Straits, where he declined, and refused to follow the recommendations \u2013 recommendations which Senator Kennedy voted for in 1955; again made in 1959; again repeated in his debates that you have heard \u2013 recommendations with regard to \u2013 again \u2013 slicing off a piece of free territory, and abandoning it, if \u2013 in effect, to the Communists. Why did the President feel this was wrong and why was the President right and his critics wrong? Because again this showed a lack of understanding of dictators, a lack of understanding particularly of Communists, because every time you make such a concession it does not lead to peace; it only encourages them to blackmail you. It encourages them to begin a war. And so I say that the record shows that we know how to keep the peace, to keep it without surrender. Let us move now to the future. It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical\u2026 leaders that the world has ever seen. That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area. First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have \u2013 if the should launch a surprise attack \u2013 we will be able to destroy their war-making capability. They must know, in other words, that it is national suicide if they begin anything. We need this kind of strength because we\u2019re the guardians of the peace. In addition to military strength, we need to see that the economy of this country continues to grow. It has grown in the past seven years. It can and will grow even more in the next four. And the reason that it must grow even more is because we have things to do at home and also because we\u2019re in a race for survival \u2013 a race in which it isn\u2019t enough to be ahead; it isn\u2019t enough simply to be complacent. We have to move ahead in order to stay ahead. And that is why, in this field, I have made recommendations which I am confident will move the American economy ahead \u2013 move it firmly and soundly so that there will never be a time when the Soviet Union will be able to challenge our superiority in this field. And so we need military strength, we need economic strength, we also need the right diplomatic policies. What are they? Again we turn to the past. Firmness but no belligerence, and by no belligerence I mean that we do not answer insult by insult. When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues. And that example that President Eisenhower has set we will continue to follow. But all this by itself is not enough. It is not enough for us simply to be the strongest nation militarily, the strongest economically, and also to have firm diplomacy. We must have a great goal. And that is: not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world, to extend it to all the world because that is America\u2019s destiny. To extend it to all the world because the Communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend Communism. And you cannot fight a victory for Communism or a strategy of victory for Communism with the strategy, simply of holding the line. And so I say that we believe that our policies of military strength, of economic strength, of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep it without surrender. We also believe that in the great field of ideals that we can lead America to the victory for freedom \u2013 victory in the newly developing countries, victory also in the captive countries \u2013 provided we have faith in ourselves and faith in our principles."}

In the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln said the question was whether this nation could exist half-slave or half-free. In the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half-slave or half-free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, in the direction of the road that we are taking, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery. I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain. We discuss tonight domestic issues, but I would not want that to be any implication to be given that this does not involve directly our struggle with Mr. Khrushchev for survival. Mr. Khrushchev is in New York, and he maintains the Communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the Soviet Union itself. The Chinese Communists have always had a large population. But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country. The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom. If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if we\u2019re moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world. If we fail, then freedom fails. Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do? Are we as strong as we should be? Are we as strong as we must be if we\u2019re going to maintain our independence, and if we\u2019re going to maintain and hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to us for assistance, to those who look to us for survival? I should make it very clear that I do not think we\u2019re doing enough, that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we\u2019re making. This is a great country, but I think it could be a greater country; and this is a powerful country, but I think it could be a more powerful country. I\u2019m not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel-mill capacity unused. I\u2019m not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world. Because economic growth means strength and vitality; it means we\u2019re able to sustain our defenses; it means we\u2019re able to meet our commitments abroad. I\u2019m not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food \u2013 some of it rotting \u2013 even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual. I saw cases in West Virginia, here in the United States, where children took home part of their school lunch in order to feed their families because I don\u2019t think we\u2019re meeting our obligations toward these Americans. I\u2019m not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are. I\u2019m not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part-time shifts. I think we should have an educational system second to none. I\u2019m not satisfied when I see men like Jimmy Hoffa \u2013 in charge of the largest union in the United States \u2013 still free. I\u2019m not satisfied when we are failing to develop the natural resources of the United States to the fullest. Here in the United States, which developed the Tennessee Valley and which built the Grand Coulee and the other dams in the Northwest United States at the present rate of hydropower production \u2013 and that is the hallmark of an industrialized society \u2013 the Soviet Union by 1975 will be producing more power than we are. These are all the things, I think, in this country that can make our society strong, or can mean that it stands still. I\u2019m not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights. If a Negro baby is born \u2013 and this is true also of Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in some of our cities \u2013 he has about one-half as much chance to get through high school as a white baby. He has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student. He has about a third as much chance to be a professional man, about half as much chance to own a house. He has about uh \u2013 four times as much chance that he\u2019ll be out of work in his life as the white baby. I think we can do better. I don\u2019t want the talents of any American to go to waste. I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government. I don\u2019t at all. I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities. And I want the states to meet their responsibilities. But I think there is also a national responsibility. The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty-five years. The people of the United States individually could not have developed the Tennessee Valley; collectively they could have. A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so. Seventeen million Americans, who live over sixty-five on an average Social Security check of about seventy-eight dollars a month, they\u2019re not able to sustain themselves individually, but they can sustain themselves through the social security system. I don\u2019t believe in big government, but I believe in effective governmental action. And I think that\u2019s the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom. It\u2019s the only way that we\u2019re going to move ahead. I think we can do a better job. I think we\u2019re going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us. We cannot turn the job over to anyone else. If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails. And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country. The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States. Because they felt that the American society was moving again. I want us to recapture that image. I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how we\u2019re doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese Communists. That is the obligation upon our generation. In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt said in his inaugural that this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny. I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous. The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack \u2013 attack it has ever known? I think it can be. And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here. I think it\u2019s time America started moving again."}

I served it uh \u2013 in the war. I\u2019m devoted to it. If I lose this election, I will continue in the Senate to try to build a stronger country. But I run because I believe this year the United States has a great opportunity to make a move forward, to make a determination here at home and around the world, that it\u2019s going to reestablish itself as a vigorous society. My judgment is that the Republican party has stood still here in the United States, and it\u2019s also stood still around the world. Uh \u2013 We\u2019re using about fifty percent of our steel capacity today. We had a recession in fifty-eight. We had a recession in fifty-four. We\u2019re not moving ahead in education the way we should. We didn\u2019t make a judgment in fifty-seven and fifty-six and fifty-five and fifty-four that outer space would be important. If we stand still here, if we appoint people to ambassadorships and positions in Washington who have a status quo outlook, who don\u2019t recognize that this is a revolutionary time, then the United States does not maintain its influence. And if we fail, the cause of freedom fails. I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again, to get our economy moving ahead, to set before the American people its goals, its unfinished business. And then throughout the world appoint the best people we can get, ambassadors who can speak the language \u2013 no mere \u2013 not merely people who made a political contribution but who can speak the language. Bring students here; let them see what kind of a country we have. Mr. Nixon said that we should not regard them as pawns in the cold war; we should identify ourselves with them. If that were true, why didn\u2019t we identify ourselves with the people of Africa? Why didn\u2019t we bring students over here? Why did we suddenly offer Congo three hundred students last June when they had the tremendous revolt? That was more than we had offered to all of Africa before from the federal government. I believe that this party \u2013 Republican party \u2013 has stood still really for twenty-five years \u2013 its leadership has. It opposed all of the programs of President Roosevelt and others \u2013 the minimum wage and for housing and economic growth and development of our natural resources, the Tennessee Valley and all the rest. And I believe that if we can get a party which believes in movement, which believes in going ahead, then we can reestablish our position in the world \u2013 strong defense, strong in economic growth, justice for our people, co- guarantee of constitutional rights, so that people will believe that we practice what we preach, and then around the world, particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which existed in Latin America at the time of Franklin Roosevelt. He was a good neighbor in Latin America because he was a good neighbor in the United States; because they saw us as a society that was compassionate, that cared about people, that was moving this country ahead. I believe it my responsibility as the leader of the Democratic party in 1960 to try to warn the American people that in this crucial time we can no longer afford to stand still. We can no longer afford to be second best. I want people all over the world to look to the United States again, to feel that we\u2019re on the move, to feel that our high noon is in the future. I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States, and that they\u2019re going to put this country back to work again. I don\u2019t believe that there is anything this country cannot do. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any burden, or any responsibility, that any American would not assume to protect his country, to protect our security, to advance the cause of freedom. And I believe it incumbent upon us now to do that. Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that that generation of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny. I believe in 1960 and sixty-one and two and three we have a rendezvous with destiny. And I believe it incumbent upon us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom; and to do that, we must give this country leadership and we must get America moving again."}

The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with. There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position. There is no question but that this nation cannot stand still; because we are in a deadly competition, a competition not only with the men in the Kremlin, but the men in Peking. We\u2019re ahead in this competition, as Senator Kennedy, I think, has implied. But when you\u2019re in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead. And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the United States should move ahead. Where, then, do we disagree? I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still. We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world. Now last year, of course, was 1958. That happened to be a recession year. But when we look at the growth of G.N.P. this year, a year of recovery, we find that it\u2019s six and nine-tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today. More about that later. Looking then to this problem of how the United States should move ahead and where the United States is moving, I think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner: Let\u2019s look at the record. Is the United States standing still? Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation? Is it true that, as far as this country is concerned, in the field of electric power, in all of the fields that he has mentioned, we have not been moving ahead. Well, we have a comparison that we can make. We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration. When we compare these two records in the areas that Senator Kennedy has \u2013 has discussed tonight, I think we find that America has been moving ahead. Let\u2019s take schools. We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years. Let\u2019s take hydroelectric power. We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history. Let us take hospitals. We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration. The same is true of highways. Let\u2019s put it in terms that all of us can understand. We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven years. That shows that there\u2019s been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor. But let\u2019s not put it there; let\u2019s put it in terms of the average family. What has happened to you? We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration. What about the prices you pay? We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration. What\u2019s the net result of this? This means that the average family income went up fifteen per cent in the Eisenhower years as against two per cent in the Truman years. Now, this is not standing still. But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isn\u2019t enough. A record is never something to stand on. It\u2019s something to build on. And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress. And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way. Senator Kennedy has suggested that he believes he knows the way. I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion. But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new. They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it. And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then. What kind of programs are we for? We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people. We are for programs, in addition, which will see that our medical care for the aged are \u2013 is \u2013 are much \u2013 is much better handled than it is at the present time. Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims. We both want to help the old people. We want to see that they do have adequate medical care. The question is the means. I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates. I could give better examples, but for \u2013 for whatever it is, whether it\u2019s in the field of housing, or health, or medical care, or schools, or the eh- development of electric power, we have programs which we believe will move America, move her forward and build on the wonderful record that we have made over these past seven and a half years. Now, when we look at these programs, might I suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much you\u2019re spending. I will concede that in all the areas to which I have referred Senator Kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than I would have it spend. I costed out the cost of the Democratic platform. It runs a minimum of thirteen and two-tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than we\u2019re presently spending. Now the Republican platform will cost more too. It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than we\u2019re presently spending. Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours? Not at all. Because it isn\u2019t a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn\u2019t a question of which government does the most. It is a question of which administration does the right thing. And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans. I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress. The final point that I would like to make is this: Senator Kennedy has suggested in his speeches that we lack compassion for the poor, for the old, and for others that are unfortunate. Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere. I know what it means to be poor. I know what it means to see people who are unemployed. I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals."}

I\u2019ve got a little ways to go before I start doing that. But I have uh \u2013 an adequate background, I believe. I am a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, the first military graduate since uh \u2013 Eisenhower. I\u2019ve served as the Governor of Georgia and have traveled extensively in foreign countries and South America, Central America, Europe, the Middle East and in Japan. I\u2019ve traveled the last twenty-one months among the people of this country. I\u2019ve talked to them and I\u2019ve listened. And I\u2019ve seen at first hand, in a very vivid way, the deep hurt that\u2019s come to this country in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia, Chile, and Pakistan, and Angola, and Watergate, CIA revelations. What we were formerly so proud of \u2013 the strength of our country, its uh \u2013 moral integrity, the representation in foreign affairs of what our people are, what our Constitution stands for, has been gone. And in the secrecy that has surrounded our foreign policy in the last few years, uh \u2013 the American people, the Congress have been excluded. I believe I know what this country ought to be. I\u2019ve uh \u2013 been one who\u2019s loved my nation as many Americans do, and I believe that there\u2019s no limit placed on what we can be in the future, if we can harness the tremendous resources \u2013 militarily, economically, and the stature of our people, the meaning of the Constitution, in the future. Every time we\u2019ve made a serious mistake in foreign affairs, it\u2019s been because the American people have been excluded from the process. If we can just tap the intelligence and ability, the sound common sense and the good judgment of the American people, we can once again have a foreign policy to make us proud instead of ashamed. And I\u2019m not gonna exclude the American people from that process in the future, as Mr. Ford and Kissinger have done. This is what it takes to have a sound foreign policy strong at home, strong defense, permanent commitments, not betray the principles of our country, and involve the American people and the Congress in the shaping of our foreign policy. Every time Mr. Ford speaks from a position of secrecy in negotiations, in secret \u2013 in secret treaties that\u2019ve been uh \u2013 pursued and achieved, in supporting dictatorships, in ignoring human rights, we are weak and the rest of the world knows it. So these are the ways that we can restore the strength of our country, and they don\u2019t require long experience in foreign policy. Nobody has that except a president who has served a long time or a secretary of state. But my background, my experience, my knowledge of the people of this country, my commitment to our principles that don\u2019t change \u2013 those are the best bases to correct the horrible mistakes of this administration and restore our own country to a position of leadership in the world."}

America is not standing still. It has not been standing still. And let\u2019s set the record straight right now by looking at the record, as Al Smith used to say. He talks about housing. We built more houses in the last seven years than in any Administration and thirty percent more than in the previous Administration. We talk about schools \u2013 three times as many classrooms built in the past Administration \u2013 and Eisenhower \u2013 than under the Truman Administration. Let\u2019s talk about civil rights. More progress in the past eight years than in the whole eighty years before. He talks about the progress in the field of slum clearance and the like. We find four times as many projects undertaken and completed in this Administration than in the previous one. Anybody that says America has been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn\u2019t been traveling in America. He\u2019s been in some other country. Let\u2019s get that straight right away. Now the second point we have to understand is this, however. America has not been standing still. But America cannot stand pat. We can\u2019t stand pat for the reason that we\u2019re in a race, as I\u2019ve indicated. We can\u2019t stand pat because it is essential with the conflict that we have around the world that we not just hold our own, that we not keep just freedom for ourselves. It is essential that we extend freedom, extend it to all the world. And this means more than what we\u2019ve been doing. It means keeping America even stronger militarily than she is. It means seeing that our economy moves forward even faster than it has. It means making more progress in civil rights than we have so that we can be a splendid example for all the world to see \u2013 a democracy in action at its best. Now, looking at the other parts of the world \u2013 South America \u2013 talking about our record and the previous one. We had a good neighbor policy, yes. It sounded fine. But let\u2019s look at it. There were eleven dictators when we came into power in 1953 in Latin America. There are only three left. Let\u2019s look at Africa. Twenty new countries in Africa during the course of this Administration. Not one of them selected a Communist government. All of them voted for freedom \u2013 a free type of government. Does this show that Communism has the bigger pull, or freedom has the bigger pull? Am I trying to indicate that we have no problems in Africa or Latin America or Asia? Of course not. What I am trying to indicate is that the tide of history\u2019s on our side, and that we can keep it on our side, because we\u2019re on the right side. We\u2019re on the side of freedom. We\u2019re on the side of justice against the forces of slavery, against the forces of injustice. But we aren\u2019t going to move America forward and we aren\u2019t going to be able to lead the world to win this struggle for freedom if we have a permanent inferiority complex about American achievements. Because we are first in the world in space, as I\u2019ve indicated; we are first in science; we are first in education, and we\u2019re going to move even further ahead with the kind of leadership that we can provide in these years ahead. One other point I would make: what could you do? Senator Kennedy and I are candidates for the presidency of the United States. And in the years to come it will be written that one or the other of us was elected and that he was or was not a great president. What will determine whether Senator Kennedy or I, if I am elected, was a great president? It will not be our ambition that will determine it, because greatness is not something that is written on a campaign poster. It will be determined to the extent that we represent the deepest ideals, the highest feelings and faith of the American people. In other words, the next president, as he leads America and the free world, can be only as great as the American people are great. And so I say in conclusion, keep America\u2019s faith strong. See that the young people of America, particularly, have faith in the ideals of freedom and faith in God, which distinguishes us from the atheistic materialists who oppose us."}

The major purpose of an election for president is to choose a leader. Someone who can analyze the depths of feeling in our country to set a standard for our people to follow, to inspire our people to reach for greatness, to correct our defects, to answer difficult questions, to bind ourselves together in a spirit of unity. I don\u2019t believe the present administration has done that. We have been discouraged and we\u2019ve been alienated. Sometimes we\u2019ve been embarrassed and sometimes we\u2019ve been ashamed. Our people are out of work, and there\u2019s a sense of withdrawal. But our country is innately very strong. Mr. Ford is a good and decent man, but he\u2019s in \u2013 been in office now more than eight hundred days approaching almost as long as John Kennedy was in office. I\u2019d like to ask the American people what, what\u2019s been accomplished. A lot remains to be done. My own background is different from his. I was a school board member, and a library board member. I served an a hospital authority. And I was in the state senate and I was governor and I\u2019m an engineer, a Naval officer, a farmer, a businessman. And I believe we require someone who can work harmoniously with the Congress, who can work closely with the people of this country, and who can bring a new image and a new spirit to Washington. Our tax structure is a disgrace, it needs to be reformed. I was Governor of Georgia for four years. We never increased sales taxes or income tax or property tax. As a matter of fact, the year before I went out of office we gave a $50 million refund to the property taxpayers of Georgia. We spend six hundred dollars per person in this country \u2013 every man, woman and child \u2013 for health care. We still rank fifteenth among all the nations of the world in infant mortality. And our cancer rate is uh \u2013 higher than any country in the world. We don\u2019t have good health care. We could have it. Employment ought to be restored to our people. We\u2019ve become almost a welfare state. We spend now 700 percent more on unemployment compensation than we did eight years ago when the Republicans took over the White House. Our people wanna go back to work. Our education system can be improved. Secrecy ought to be stripped away from government and a maximum of personal privacy ought to be maintained. Our housing programs have uh \u2013 gone bad. It used to be that the average \u2013 uh family could own a house. But now less than a third of our people can afford to buy their own homes. The budget was more grossly out of balance last year than ever before in the history of our country \u2013 $65 billion \u2013 primarily because our people are not at work. Inflation is robbing us, as we\u2019ve already discussed, and the government bureaucracy is uh \u2013 just a horrible mess. This doesn\u2019t have to be. Now I don\u2019t know all the answers. Nobody could. But I do know that if the president of the United States and the Congress of the United States and the people of the United States said, \u201cI believe our nation is greater than what we are now.\u201d I believe that if we are inspired, if we can achieve a degree of unity, if we can set our goals high enough and work toward recognized goals with industry and labor and agriculture along with government at all levels, then we can achieve great things. We might have to do it slowly. There are no magic answers to do it. But I believe together we can make great progress. We can correct our difficult mistakes and answer those very tough questions. I believe in the greatness of our country, and I believe the American people are ready for a change in Washington. We\u2019ve been drifting too long. We\u2019ve been dormant too long. We\u2019ve been discouraged too long. And we have not set an example for our own people. But I believe that we can now establish in the White House a good relationship with Congress, a good relationship with our people, set very high goals for our country. And with inspiration and hard work we can achieve great things. And let the world know \u2013 that\u2019s very important. But more importantly, let the people in our own country realize that we still live in the greatest nation on earth. Thank you very much."}

I must say that forty-four percent and that Soviet country is causing us a good deal of trouble tonight. I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship. I don\u2019t want to see the day when it\u2019s sixty percent of ours, and seventy and seventy-five and eighty and ninety percent of ours, with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction. Secondly, the Vice President mentioned medical care for the aged. Our program was an amendment to the Kerr bill. The Kerr bill provided assistance to all those who were not on Social Security. I think it\u2019s a very clear contrast. In 1935, when the Social Security Act was written, ninety-four out of ninety-five Republicans voted against it. Mr. Landon ran in 1936 to repeal it. In August of 1960, when we tried to get it again, but this time for medical care, we received the support of one Republican in the Senate on this occasion. Thirdly, I think the question before the American people is: as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them, the goals are the same for all Americans. The means are at question. The means are at issue. If you feel that everything that is being done now is satisfactory, that the relative power and prestige and strength of the United States is increasing in relation to that of the Communists; that we\u2019ve b- gaining more security, that we are achieving everything as a nation that we should achieve, that we are achieving a better life for our citizens and greater strength, then I agree. I think you should vote for Mr. Nixon. But if you feel that we have to move again in the sixties, that the function of the president is to set before the people the unfinished business of our society as Franklin Roosevelt did in the thirties, the agenda for our people \u2013 what we must do as a society to meet our needs in this country and protect our security and help the cause of freedom. As I said at the beginning, the question before us all, that faces all Republicans and all Democrats, is: can freedom in the next generation conquer, or are the Communists going to be successful? That\u2019s the great issue. And if we meet our responsibilities I think freedom will conquer. If we fail, if we fail to move ahead, if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country, then I think that uh \u2013 the tide could begin to run against us. And I don\u2019t want historians, ten years from now, to say, these were the years when the tide ran out for the United States. I want them to say these were the years when the tide came in; these were the years when the United States started to move again. That\u2019s the question before the American people, and only you can decide what you want, what you want this country to be, what you want to do with the future. I think we\u2019re ready to move. And it is to that great task, if we\u2019re successful, that we will address ourselves."}

I\u2019ve been critical of the Administration\u2019s failure to suggest policies which would make it possible for us to establish, for example, closer relations with Poland, particularly after the fifty-five-fifty-six period and the Hungarian revolution. We indicated at that time that we were not going to intervene militarily. But there was a period there when Poland demonstrated a national independence and even the Polish government moved some differn- di- distance away from the Soviet Union. I suggested that we amend our legislation so that we could enjoy closer economic ties. We received the support first of the Administration and then not, and we were defeated by one vote in the Senate. We passed the bill in the Senate this year but it didn\u2019t pass the House. I would say Eastern Europe is the area of vulnerability of the uh \u2013 s- of the Soviet Union. Secondly, the relations between Russia and China. They are now engaged in a debate over whether war is the means of Communizing the world or whether they should use subversion, infiltration, economic struggles and all the rest. No one can say what that course of action will be, but I think the next president of the United States should watch it carefully. If those two powers should split, it could have great effects throughout the entire world. Thirdly, I believe that India represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world. India started from about the same place that China did. Chinese Communists have been moving ahead the last ten years. India under a free society has been making some progress. But if India does not succeed \u2013 with her four hundred and fifty million people, if she can\u2019t make freedom work \u2013 then people around the world are going to determine \u2013 particularly in the underdeveloped world \u2013 that the only way that they can develop their resources is through the Communist system. Fourth, let me say that in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the great force on our side is the desire of people to be free. This has expressed itself in the revolts in Eastern Europe. It\u2019s expressed itself in the desire of the people of Africa to be independent of Western Europe. They want to be free. And my judgment is that they don\u2019t want to give their freedom up to become Communists. They want to stay free, independent perhaps of us, but certainly independent of the Communists. And I believe if we identify ourselves with that force, if we identify ourselves with it as Lincoln, as Wilson did, as Franklin Roosevelt did, if we become known as the friend of freedom, sustaining freedom, helping freedom, helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease, helping them build their lives, I believe in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, eventually in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East, certainly in Western Europe, we can strengthen freedom. We can make it move. We can put the Communists on the defensive."}

This election will also determine what kind of world we leave our children. Will it be a nightmare world threatened with the proliferation of atomic bombs, not just in five major countries but dozens of smaller countries that have been permitted to develop atomic weapons because of a failure of our top leadership to stop proliferation? Will we have a world of hunger and \u2013 and hatred, and will we be living in an armed camp stripped of our friendship and allies hiding behind a tight defense that\u2019s been drawn in around us because we are fearful of the outside world? Will we have a government of secrecy that excludes the American people from participation in making basic decisions and therefore covers up mistakes and makes it possible for our government \u2013 our government \u2013 to depart from the principles of our Constitution and Bill of Rights? Or will we have a world of peace with the threat of atomic weapons eliminated, with full trade, with our people at work, inflation controlled, openness in government, our people proud once again, Congress, citizens, president, secretary of state working in harmony and unity toward a common future? Or world where people have enough to eat and a world where we care about those who don\u2019t? Can we become a breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world? I believe we can and we ought to. Now we\u2019ve been hurt in recent years in this country. In the aftermath of Vietnam, Cambodia, Chile, Pakistan, Angola, Watergate, CIA, we\u2019ve been hurt. Our people feel that we\u2019ve lost something precious. That\u2019s not necessary. I wanna see our nation \u2013 return to a posture and an image and a standard to make us proud once again. I remember the world with NATO, and the world of Point Four, and the world of the Marshall Plan, and the world of the Peace Corps. Why can\u2019t we have that once again? We ought to be a beacon for nations who search for peace and who search for freedom, who search for individual liberty, who search for basic human rights. We haven\u2019t been lately. We can be once again. We\u2019ll never have that world leadership until we are strong at home, and we can have that strength if we return to the basic principles.

I felt that \u2014 I wish we\u2019d have had a better vision of the future. I wish that, looking back at the beginning of the president\u2019s term and even further back than that, that we\u2019d have recognized that there was a growing energy and passion for freedom in that part of the world, and that we would have worked more aggressively with our friend and with other friends in the region to have them make the transition towards a more representative form of government, such that it didn\u2019t explode in the way that it did. But once it exploded, I felt the same as the president did, which is these freedom voices and the streets of Egypt, where the people who were speaking of our principles and the President Mubarak had done things which were unimaginable and the idea of him crushing his people was not something that we could possibly support. Let me step back and talk about what I think our mission has to be in the Middle East and even more broadly, because our purpose is to make sure the world is more \u2014 is peaceful. We want a peaceful planet. We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know they\u2019re going to have a bright and prosperous future, not be at war. That\u2019s our purpose. And the mantle of leadership for the \u2014 promoting the principles of peace has fallen to America. We didn\u2019t ask for it. But it\u2019s an honor that we have it. But for us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong. And that begins with a strong economy here at home. Unfortunately, the economy is not stronger. When the \u2014 when the president of Iraq \u2014 excuse me, of Iran, Ahmadinejad, says that our debt makes us not a great country, that\u2019s a frightening thing.

We\u2019re blessed with terrific soldiers, and extraordinary technology and intelligence. But the idea of a trillion dollar in cuts through sequestration and budget cuts to the military would change that. We need to have strong allies. Our association and connection with our allies is essential to America\u2019s strength. We\u2019re the great nation that has allies, 42 allies and friends around the world. And, finally, we have to stand by our principles. And if we\u2019re strong in each of those things, American influence will grow.

In fact, it would be deflationary; it would cause great unemployment; it would cause a real slowdown in our economy. If it ever becomes necessary, and is wise economically and essential to our security, I would have no hesitancy in suggesting a tax increase or any other policy which would defend the United States. I have talked in every speech about the fact that these are going to be very difficult times in the nineteen-sixties and that we\u2019re going to have to meet our responsibilities as citizens. I\u2019m talking about a national mood. I\u2019m talking about our willingness to bear any burdens in order to maintain our own freedom and in order to meet our freedom around the globe. We don\u2019t know what the future\u2019s going to bring. But I would not want anyone to elect me uh \u2013 president of the United States \u2013 or vote for me \u2013 under the expectation that life would be easier if I were elected. Now, many of the programs that I\u2019m talking about \u2013 economic growth, care for the aged, development of our natural resources \u2013 build the strength of the United States. That\u2019s how the United States began to prepare for its great actions in World War II and in the post-war period. If we\u2019re moving ahead, if we\u2019re providing a viable economy, if our people have sufficient resources so that they can consume what we produce; then this country\u2019s on the move, then we\u2019re stronger, then we set a better example to the world. So we have the problem of not only building our own uh \u2013 military strength and extending uh \u2013 our policies abroad, we have to do a job here at home.

Bob, Mr. President, folks at Lynn University, good to be with you. I\u2019m optimistic about the future. I\u2019m excited about our prospects as a nation. I want to see peace. I want to see growing peace in this country. It\u2019s our objective. We have an opportunity to have real leadership. America\u2019s going to have that kind of leadership and continue to promote principles of peace to make a world a safer place and make people in this country more confident that their future is secure. I also want to make sure that we get this economy going. And there are two very different paths the country can take. One is a path represented by the president, which at the end of four years would mean we\u2019d have $20 trillion in debt heading towards Greece. I\u2019ll get us on track to a balanced budget. The president\u2019s path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay. I want to make sure our take-home pay turns around and starts to grow. The president\u2019s path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay. I want to make sure take-home pay turns around and starts to grow. The president\u2019s path means 20 million people out of work struggling for a good job. I\u2019ll get people back to work with 12 million new jobs. I\u2019m going to make sure that we get people off of food stamps, not by cutting the program, but by getting them good jobs. America\u2019s going to come back, and for that to happen, we\u2019re going to have to have a president who can work across the aisle. I was in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat. I learned how to get along on the other side of the aisle. We\u2019ve got to do that in Washington. Washington is broken. I know what it takes to get this country back, and will work with good Democrats and good Republicans to do that. This nation is the hope of the earth. We\u2019ve been blessed by having a nation that\u2019s free and prosperous thanks to the contributions of the greatest generation.

Since I became president, 43, 44 countries have gone democratic, no longer totalitarian, no longer living under dictatorship or communist rule. This is exciting. New world order to me means freedom and democracy. I think we will have a continuing responsibility, as the only remaining superpower, to stay involved. If we pull back in some isolation and say we don\u2019t have to do our share, or more than our share, anymore, I believe you are going to just ask for conflagration that we\u2019ll get involved in the future. NATO, for example, has kept the peace for many, many years, and I want to see us keep fully staffed in NATO so we\u2019ll continue to guarantee the peace in Europe. But the exciting thing is, the fear of nuclear war is down. And you hear all the bad stuff that\u2019s happened on my watch; I hope people will recognize that this is something pretty good for mankind. I hope they\u2019ll think it\u2019s good that democracy and freedom is on the move. And we\u2019re going to stay engaged, as long as I\u2019m president, working to improve things. You know, it\u2019s so easy now to say, hey, cut out foreign aid, we got a problem at home. I think the US has to still have the Statue of Liberty as a symbol, caring for others. Right this very minute we\u2019re sending supplies in to help these little starving kids in Somalia. It\u2019s the US that\u2019s taken the lead in humanitarian aid into Bosnia. We\u2019re doing this all around the world. Yes, we got problems at home. And I think I got a good plan to help fix those problems at home. But because of our leadership, because we didn\u2019t listen to the freeze \u2014 the nuclear-freeze group, do you remember \u2014 freeze it, back in the late 70s \u2014 freeze, don\u2019t touch it; we\u2019re going to lock it in now or else we\u2019ll have war. President Reagan said no, peace through strength. It worked. The Soviet Union is no more, and now we\u2019re working to help them become totally democratic through the Freedom Support Act that I led on, a great Democratic ambassador, Bob Strauss, over there, Jim Baker, all of us got this thing passed \u2014 through cooperation, Ross \u2014 it worked with cooperation, and you\u2019re for that, I\u2019m sure, helping Russia become democratic. So the new world order to me means freedom and democracy, keep engaged, do not pull back into isolation. And we are the US, and we have a responsibility to lead and to guarantee the security. If it hadn\u2019t been for us, Saddam Hussein would be sitting on top of three-fifths of the oil supply of the world and he\u2019d have nuclear weapons. And only the US could do this.

But I think it\u2019s time to talk about the future. Our nation in the last eight years has been divided as never before. It\u2019s a time for unity. It\u2019s a time to draw ourselves together: to have a president and a Congress that can work together with mutual respect for a change, cooperating for a change, in the open for a change, so the people can understand their own government. It\u2019s time for government, industry, labor, manufacturing, agriculture, education, other entities in our society to cooperate. And it\u2019s a time for government to understand and to cooperate with our people. For a long time our American citizens have been excluded, sometimes misled, sometimes have been lied to. This is uh \u2013 not compatible with the purpose of our nation. I believe in our country. It needs to be competent. The government needs to be well-managed, efficient, economical, We need to have a government that\u2019s sensitive to our people\u2019s needs \u2013 to those who are poor, who don\u2019t have adequate health care, who have been cheated too long with our tax programs, who\u2019ve been out of jobs, whose families have been torn apart. We need to restore the faith and the trust of the American people in their own government. In addition to that, we\u2019ve suffered because we haven\u2019t had leadership in this administration. We\u2019ve got a government of stalemate. We\u2019ve lost the vision of what our country can and ought to be. This is not the America that we\u2019ve known in the past. It\u2019s not the America that we have to have in the future. I don\u2019t claim to know all the answers. But I\u2019ve got confidence in my country. Our economic strength is still there. Our system of government \u2013 in spite of Vietnam, Cambodia, CIA, Watergate \u2013 is still the best system of government on earth. And the greatest resource of all are the two hundred and fifteen million Americans who have within us the strength, the character, the intelligence, the experience, the patriotism, the idealism, the compassion, the sense of brotherhood on which we can rely in the future to restore the greatness to our country We ought not to be excluded from our government anymore. We need a president who can go in \u2013 who derives his strength from the people. I owe the special interests nothing. I owe everything to you, the people of this country.

I think it\u2019s been a very constructive debate and I hope it\u2019s helped to acquaint the American people with the sharp differences between myself and Governor Reagan. Also, I want to thank the people of Cleveland and Ohio for being such hospitable hosts during these last few hours in my life. I\u2019ve been President now for almost four years. I\u2019ve had to make thousands of decisions, and each one of those decisions has been a learning process. I\u2019ve seen the strength of my nation, and I\u2019ve seen the crises it approached in a tentative way. And I\u2019ve had to deal with those crises as best I could. As I\u2019ve studied the record between myself and Governor Reagan, I\u2019ve been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us. I think the result of this debate indicates that that fact is true. I consider myself in the mainstream of my party. I consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of Presidents who served before me. The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure. We must have a society that\u2019s just and fair. And we must extend the benefits of our own commitment to peace, to create a peaceful world. I believe that since I\u2019ve been in office, there have been six or eight areas of combat evolved in other parts of the world. In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country. I\u2019ve done that with moderation, with care, with thoughtfulness; sometimes consulting experts. But, I\u2019ve learned in this last three and a half years that when an issue is extremely difficult, when the call is very close, the chances are the experts will be divided almost 50-50. And the final judgment about the future of the nation \u2013 war, peace, involvement, reticence, thoughtfulness, care, consideration, concern \u2013 has to be made by the man in the Oval Office. It\u2019s a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people in the process, with an open Government, the job is a very gratifying one. The American people now are facing, next Tuesday, a lonely decision. Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country. And I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference. If one vote per precinct had changed in 1960, John Kennedy would never have been President of this nation. And if a few more people had gone to the polls and voted in 1968, Hubert Humphrey would have been President; Richard Nixon would not. There is a partnership involved in our nation. To stay strong, to stay at peace, to raise high the banner of human rights, to set an example for the rest of the world, to let our deep beliefs and commitments be felt by others in other nations, is my plan for the future. I ask the American people to join me in this partnership."}

I don\u2019t uh \u2013 look at the picture as bleakly as you have indicated in your question, Mr. Trewhitt. I believe that the United States ha- had many successes in recent years, in recent months, as far as the Communist movement is concerned. We have been successful in Portugal, where a year ago it looked like there was a very great possibility that the uh \u2013 Communists would take over in Portugal. It didn\u2019t happen. We have a democracy in Portugal today. A few uh \u2013 months ago, or I should say, maybe two years ago, the Soviet Union looked like they had continued strength in the Middle East. Today, according to Prime Minister Rabin, the Soviet Union is weaker in the Middle East than they have been in many, many years. The facts are, there \u2013 the Soviet Union relationship with Egypt is uh \u2013 at a low level. The Soviet Union relationship with Syria is at a very low point. The United States today, according to Prime Minister Rabin of Israel, is a- at a peak in its uh \u2013 influence and power in the Middle East. But let\u2019s turn for a minute to the uhh \u2013 southern African operations that are now going on. The United States of America took the initiative in southern Africa. We wanted to end the bloodshed in southern Africa. We wanted to have the right of self-determination in southern Africa. We wanted to have majority rule with the full protection of the rights of the minority. We wanted to preserve human dignity in southern Africa. We have taken the initiative, and in southern Africa today the United States is trusted by the black front-line nations and black Africa. The United States is trusted by other elements in southern Africa. The United States foreign policy under this administration has been one of progress and success. And I believe that instead of talking about Soviet progress, we can talk about American successes. And may I make an observation \u2013 part of the question you asked, Mr. Trewhitt? I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s in the best interest of the United States and the NATO nations to have a Communist government in NATO. Mr. Carter has indicated he would look with sympathy to a Communist government in NATO. I think that would destroy the integrity and the strength of NATO, and I am totally opposed to it."}

What\u2019s at issue here is the President\u2019s application of his authority to understand what a President must know to lead this nation, secure our defense, and make the decisions and the judgments that are necessary. A minute ago the President quoted Cicero, I believe. I want to quote somebody a little closer to home, Harry Truman. He said, \u201cThe buck stops here.\u201d We just heard the President\u2019s answer for the problems at the barracks in Lebanon, where 241 marines were killed. What happened? First, the Joint Chiefs of Staff went to the President, said, \u201cDon\u2019t put those troops there.\u201d They did it. And then 5 days before the troops were killed, they went back to the President, through the Secretary of Defense, and said, \u201cPlease, Mr. President, take those troops out of there because we can\u2019t defend them.\u201d They didn\u2019t do it. And we know what happened. After that, once again, our Embassy was exploded. This is the fourth time this has happened \u2014 an identical attack, in the same region, despite warnings \u2014 even public warnings \u2014 from the terrorists. Who\u2019s in charge? Who\u2019s handling this matter? That\u2019s my main point. Now, on arms control, we\u2019re completing 4 years. This is the first administration since the bomb went off that made no progress. We have an arms race underway instead. A President has to lead his government or it won\u2019t be done. Different people with different views fight with each other. For 3\\1\/2\\ years, this administration avoided arms control, resisted tabling arms control proposals that had any hope of agreeing, rebuked their negotiator in 1981 when he came close to an agreement, at least in principle, on medium-range weapons. And we have this arms race underway. And a recent book that just came out by perhaps the Nation\u2019s most respected author in this field, Strobe Talbott, called \u201cDeadly Gambits,\u201d concludes that this President has failed to master the essential details needed to command and lead us, both in terms of security and terms of arms control. That\u2019s why they call the President the Commander in Chief. Good intentions, I grant. But it takes more than that. You must be tough and smart. The President\u2019s Leadership Mr. Trewhitt. This question of leadership keeps arising in different forms in this discussion already. And the President, Mr. Mondale, has called you whining and vacillating, among the more charitable phrases \u2014 weak, I believe. It is a question of leadership. And he has made the point that you have not repudiated some of the semidiplomatic activity of the Reverend Jackson, particularly in Central America. Did you approve of his diplomatic activity? And are you prepared to repudiate him now? I read his statement the other day. I don\u2019t admire Fidel Castro at all. And I\u2019ve said that. Che Guevara was a contemptible figure in civilization\u2019s history. I know the Cuban state as a police state, and all my life I\u2019ve worked in a way that demonstrates that. But Jesse Jackson is an independent person. I don\u2019t control him. And let\u2019s talk about people we do control. In the last debate,\\1\\ (FOOTNOTE) the Vice President of the United States said that I said the marines had died shamefully and died in shame in Lebanon. I demanded an apology from Vice President Bush because I had, instead, honored these young men, grieved for their families, and think they were wonderful Americans that honored us all. What does the President have to say about taking responsibility for a Vice President who won\u2019t apologize for something like that?

And the initiatives that we took in southern Africa are the best examples of what this administration is doing and will continue to do in the next four years. If the United States had not moved when we did in southern Africa, there\u2019s no doubt there would have been an acceleration of bloodshed in that tragic part of the world. If we had not taken our initiative, it\u2019s very, very possible that uh \u2013 the government of Rhodesia would have been overrun and that the Soviet Union and the Cubans would have dominated uh \u2013 southern Africa. So the United States, seeking to preserve the principle of self-determination, to eliminate the possibility of bloodshed, to protect the rights of the minority as we insisted upon the rights of the majority, uh \u2013 I believe followed the good conscience of the American people in foreign policy. And I believe that we used our skill. Secretary of State Kissinger has done a superb job in working with the black African nations, the so-called front-line nations. He has done a superb job in getting the prime minister of South Africa, Mr. Vorster, to agree that the time had come for a solution to the problem of Rhodesia. Secretary Kissinger, in his meeting with uh \u2013 Prime Minister Smith of Rhodesia, was able to convince him that it was in the best interests of whites as well as blacks in Rhodesia to find an answer for a transitional government and then a majority government. This is a perfect example of the kind of leadership that the United States, under this administration, has taken. And I can assure you that this administration will follow that high moral principle in our future efforts in foreign policy, including our efforts in the Middle East where it is vitally important because the Middle East is the crossroads of the world. There\u2019ve been more disputes in its area where there\u2019s more volatility than any other place in the world. But because Arab nations and the Israelis trust the United States, we were able to take the lead in the Sinai II Agreement. And I can assure you that the United States will have the leadership role in moving toward a comprehensive settlement of the Middle Eastern problems, I hope and trust as soon as possible. And we will do it with the highest moral principles."}

In my judgment that statement has been distorted uh \u2013 by Mr. Nixon and others in their debates around the country and in their discussions. Mr. Lodge, on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d a month ago, said if there was ever a case when we did not have law an our side it was in the U-2 incident. The U-2 flights were proper from the point of view of protecting our security. But they were not in accordance with international law. And I said that I felt that rather than tell the lie which we told, rather than indicate that the flights would continue \u2013 in fact, I believe Mr. Nixon himself said on May fifteenth that the flights would continue even though Mr. Herter testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that they had been canceled as of May twelfth \u2013 that it would have been far better that if we had expressed regrets, if that would have saved the summit, and if the summit is useful \u2013 and I believe it is. The point that is always left out is the fact that we expressed regrets to Castro this winter; that we expressed regrets \u2013 the Eisenhower Administration expressed regrets \u2013 for a flight over Southern Russia in 1958. We expressed regrets for a flight over Eastern Germany under this Administration. The Soviet Union in 1955 expressed regrets to us over the Bering Sea incident. The Chinese Communists expressed regrets to us over a plane incident in 1956. That is the accepted procedure between nations; and my judgment is that we should follow the advice of Theodore Roosevelt: Be strong; maintain a strong position; but also speak softly. I believe that in those cases where international custom calls for the expression of a regret, if that would have kept the summit going, in my judgment it was a proper action. It\u2019s not appeasement. It\u2019s not soft. I believe we should be stronger than we now are. I believe we should have a stronger military force. I believe we should increase our strength all over the world. But I don\u2019t confuse words with strength; and in my judgment if the summit was useful, if it would have brought us closer to peace, that rather than the lie that we told \u2013 which has been criticized by all responsible people afterwards \u2013 it would have been far better for us to follow the common diplomatic procedure of expressing regrets and then try to move on."}

And since today is Eleanor Roosevelt\u2019s 100th birthday, let me quote her. She said, \u201cIt is not enough to want peace, you must believe in it. And it is not enough to believe in it, you must work for it.\u201d This administration\u2019s policies have indicated quite the opposite. The last time I heard Vice President Bush blame the fact that they didn\u2019t meet with the Soviet leader, and this is the first president in forty years not to meet with a Soviet counterpart. He said the reason was because there are three Soviet leaders in the past three and a half years. I went and got a computer printout. It\u2019s five pages of the leaders, world leaders, that the Soviet leaders have met with, and they\u2019re not little people. They\u2019re people like Mitterrand of France and Kohl of Germany and President Kiprianou of Cyprus \u2013 you go down the list, five pages of people that the Soviet leaders have managed to meet with and somehow they couldn\u2019t meet with the president of the United States. In addition to not meeting with his Soviet counterpart, this is the first president \u2013 and you\u2019re right \u2013 since the start of negotiating arms control agreements who have not negotiated an arms control agreement, But not only has he not negotiated one, he\u2019s been opposed to every single one that every other president has negotiated, including Eisenhower, including Ford, and including Nixon. Now, let me just say that with reference to the vice-president\u2019s comments about the intent and the desire of the United Sites and this administration, the Soviet Union did walk out of the talks. I agree. But it seems to me in 1982, when the administration presented its Start proposal, that it wasn\u2019t a realistic proposal. And that is the comment that was made by Secretary Haig after he left office, because what it dealt with was that it dealt just with land-based nuclear missiles, which is where the Soviets had the bulk of their missiles. But that aside, in 1982, I believe it was, their own negotiator, Nitze, came out with a proposal called the \u201cwalk-in-the-woods proposal\u201d which would have limited the number of nuclear arms in Europe. That proposal was turned down by the administration \u2013 a proposal presented by its own administrator. Now I\u2019m delighted that they met with Mr. Gromyko, but they could have had that opportunity to meet with him in 1981 when he came to the UN, which he had done with every other president before, and in 1982 as well.

It\u2019s not government investments that makes businesses grow and hire people. Let me also note that the greatest threat that the world faces, the greatest national security threat is a nuclear Iran. Let\u2019s talk about China. China has an interest that\u2019s very much like ours in one respect, and that is they want a stable world. They don\u2019t want war. They don\u2019t want to see protectionism. They don\u2019t want to see the world break out into \u2014 into various forms of chaos, because they have to \u2014 they have to manufacture goods and put people to work and they have about 20,000 \u2014 20 million, rather, people coming out of the farms every year coming into the cities, needing jobs. So they want the economy to work and the world to be free and open. And so we can be a partner with China. We don\u2019t have to be an adversary in any way, shape or form. We can work with them, we can collaborate with them, if they\u2019re willing to be responsible. Now, they look at us and say, Is it a good idea to be with America? How strong are we going to be? How strong is our economy? They look at the fact that we owe \u2019em a trillion dollars and owe other people $16 trillion in total, including that. They look at our \u2014 our decision to \u2014 to cut back on our military capabilities. A trillion dollars. The secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating. It\u2019s not my term, it\u2019s the president\u2019s own secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating. It\u2019s not my term, it\u2019s the president\u2019s own Secretary of Defense, called them devastating.

And the answer is, yes, if I\u2019m president, America will be very strong. We\u2019ll also make sure that we have trade relations with China that work for us. I\u2019ve watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and people have lost their jobs because China has not played by the same rules, in part by holding down artificially the value of their currency. It holds down the prices of their goods. It means our goods aren\u2019t as competitive and we lose jobs. That\u2019s got to end. They\u2019re making some progress; they need to make more. That\u2019s why on day one, i will label them a currency manipulator, which allows us to apply tariffs where they\u2019re taking jobs. They\u2019re stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our goods. They have to understand we want to trade with them.

I saw them work, I saw them make very hard decisions. I didn\u2019t always agree with their decisions, whether they were Democratic or Republican presidents. For the last two years, I\u2019ve been the president, and I have found from experience that it\u2019s much more difficult to make those decisions than it is to second-guess them. I became president at the time that the United States was in a very troubled time.

The American people had lost faith and trust and confidence in the presidency itself.

The American people are healed, are working together. The American people are moving again, and moving in the right direction. We have cut inflation by better than half. We have came out of the recession and we\u2019re well on the road to real prosperity in this country again. There has been a restoration of faith and confidence and trust in the presidency because I\u2019ve been open, candid and forthright.

In fact uh \u2013 Mr. Nixon uh \u2013 discussed that a week ago in a speech. I believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined.

That\u2019s the argument between Mr. Nixon and myself and on that issue the American people have to make their judgment and I think it\u2019s a important judgment. I think in many ways this election is more important than any since 1932, or certainly almost any in this century. Because we disagree very fundamentally on the position of the United States, and if his view prevails then I think that\u2019s going to bring an important result to this country in the sixties. If our view prevails that we have to do more, that we have to make a greater national and international effort, that we have lost prestige in Latin America \u2013 the President of Brazil \u2013 the new incumbent running for office called on Castro during his campaign because he thought it was important to get the vote of those who were supporting Castro in Latin America.

I want to thank President Reagan for agreeing to debate. He didn\u2019t have to, and he did, and we all appreciate it. The President\u2019s favorite question is: Are you better off? Well, if you\u2019re wealthy, you\u2019re better off. If you\u2019re middle income, you\u2019re about where you were. And if you\u2019re modest income, you\u2019re worse off. That\u2019s what the economists tell us. But is that really the question that should be asked? Isn\u2019t the real question is will we be better off? Will our children be better off? Are we building the future that this nation needs? I believe that if we ask those questions that bear on our future, not just congratulate ourselves but challenge us to solve those problems, you\u2019ll see that we need new leadership. Are we better of with this arms race? Will we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens? Are we better off when we deemphasize our values in human rights? Are we better off when we load our children with this fantastic debt? Would fathers and mothers feel proud of themselves if they loaded their children with debts like this nation is now \u2014 over a trillion dollars on the shoulders of our children? Can we say, really say that we will be better off when we pull away from sort of that basic American instinct of decency and fairness? I would rather lose a campaign about decency than win a campaign about self-interest. I don\u2019t think this nation is composed of people who care only for themselves. And when we sought to assault Social Security and Medicare, as the record shows we did, I think that was mean-spirited. When we terminated 400,000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability \u2014 confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for 4 years, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what America is all about. America is a fair society, and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him. I believe there\u2019s fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system. I believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment. And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful. These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price. That\u2019s not fair for our future. I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training, because this world is more complex and we\u2019re being pressed harder all the time. I believe in opening doors. We won the Olympics, in part, because we\u2019ve had civil rights laws and the laws that prohibit discrimination against women. I have been for those efforts all my life. The President\u2019s record is quite different. The question is our future. President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, \u201cWe are great, but we can be greater.\u201d We can be better if we face our future, rejoice in our strengths, face our problems, and by solving them, build a better society for our children. Thank you."}

And those principles include human rights, human dignity, free enterprise, freedom of expression, elections. Because when there are elections, people tend to vote for peace. They don\u2019t vote for war. So we want to promote those principles around the world. We recognize that there are places of conflict in the world. We want to end those conflicts to the extent humanly possible. But in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong. America must lead. And for that to happen, we have to strengthen our economy here at home. You can\u2019t have 23 million people struggling to get a job. You can\u2019t have an economy that over the last three years keeps slowing down its growth rate. You can\u2019t have kids coming out of college, half of them can\u2019t find a job today, or a job that\u2019s commensurate with their college degree. We have to get our economy going. And our military, we\u2019ve got to strengthen our military long-term. We don\u2019t know what the world is going to throw at us down the road. We \u2014 we make decisions today in the military that \u2014 that will confront challenges we can\u2019t imagine. In the 2000 debates, there was no mention of terrorism, for instance. And a year later, 9\/11 happened. So, we have to make decisions based upon uncertainty, and that means a strong military. I will not cut our military budget. We have to also stand by our allies. I \u2014 I think the tension that existed between Israel and the United States was very unfortunate. I think also that pulling our missile defense program out of Poland in the way we did was also unfortunate in terms of, if you will, disrupting the relationship in some ways that existed between us. And then, of course, with regards to standing for our principles, when \u2014 when the students took to the streets in Tehran and the people there protested, the Green Revolution occurred, for the president to be silent I thought was an enormous mistake. We have to stand for our principles, stand for our allies, stand for a strong military and stand for a stronger economy."}

Then I believe that we should move full time on our missile production, particularly on Minuteman and on Polaris. It may be a long period, but we must \u2013 we must get started immediately. Now on the question of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, I must say that I feel that another effort should be made by a new Administration in January of 1961, to renew negotiations with the Soviet Union and see whether it\u2019s possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chances of contamination of the atmosphere, and also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity. There are indications, because of new inventions, that ten, fifteen, or twenty nations will have a nuclear capacity \u2013 including Red China \u2013 by the end of the presidential office in 1964. This is extremely serious. There have been many wars in the history of mankind. And to take a chance uh \u2013 now be \u2013 and not make every effort that we could make to provide for some control over these weapons, I think would be a great mistake. One of my disagreements with the present Administration has been that I don\u2019t feel a real effort has been made an this very sensitive subject, not only of nuclear controls, but also of general disarmament. Less than a hundred people have been working throughout the entire federal government on this subject, and I believe it\u2019s been reflected in our success and failures at Geneva. Now, we may not succeed. The Soviet Union may not agree to an inspection system. We may be able to get satisfactory assurances. It may be necessary for us to begin testing again. But I hope the next Administration \u2013 and if I have anything to do with it, the next Administration will \u2013 make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels. These must be done. If we cannot succeed, then we must strengthen ourselves. But I would make the effort because I think the fate not only of our own civilization, but I think the fate of world and the future of the human race is involved in preventing a nuclear war."}

This evening we talked about national strength. I believe we need to be strong, and I will keep us strong. But I think strength must also require wisdom and smarts in its exercise. That\u2019s key to the strength of our nation. A President must know the essential facts essential to command. But a President must also have a vision of where this nation should go. Tonight, as Americans, you have a choice. And you\u2019re entitled to know where we would take this country if you decide to elect us. As President, I would press for long-term, vigorous economic growth. That\u2019s why I want to get these debts down and these interest rates down, restore America\u2019s exports, help rural America, which is suffering so much, and bring the jobs back here for our children. I want this next generation to be the best educated in American history, to invest in the human mind and science again, so we\u2019re out front. I want this nation to protect its air, its water, its land, and its public health. America is not temporary; we\u2019re forever. And as Americans, our generation should protect this wonderful land for our children. I want a nation of fairness, where no one is denied the fullness of life or discriminated against, and we deal compassionately with those in our midst who are in trouble. And, above all, I want a nation that\u2019s strong. Since we debated 2 weeks ago, the United States and the Soviet Union have built a hundred more warheads, enough to kill millions of Americans and millions of Soviet citizens. This doesn\u2019t strengthen us. This weakens the chances of civilization to survive. I remember the night before I became Vice President. I was given the briefing and told that any time, night or day, I might be called upon to make the most fateful decision on Earth \u2014 whether to fire these atomic weapons that could destroy the human species. That lesson tells us two things: One, pick a President that you know will know if that tragic moment ever comes what he must know, because there\u2019ll be no time for staffing committees or advisers. A President must know right then. But above all, pick a President who will fight to avoid the day when that God-awful decision ever needs to be made. And that\u2019s why this election is so terribly important. America and Americans decide not just what\u2019s happening in this country. We are the strongest and most powerful free society on Earth. When you make that judgment, you are deciding not only the future of our nation; in a very profound respect, you\u2019re deciding the future of the world. We need to move on. It\u2019s time for America to find new leadership. Please, join me in this cause to move confidently and with a sense of assurance and command to build the blessed future of our nation."}

The place where we\u2019ve seen manufacturing go has been China. China is now the largest manufacturer in the world. It used to be the United States of America. A lot of good people have lost jobs. A half a million manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last four years. That\u2019s total over the last four years. One of the reasons for that is that people think it\u2019s more attractive in some cases to go offshore than to stay here. We have made it less attractive for enterprises to stay here than to go offshore from time to time. What I will do as president is make sure it\u2019s more attractive to come to America again. This is the way we\u2019re going to create jobs in this country. It\u2019s not by trickle-down government, saying we\u2019re going to take more money from people and hire more government workers, raise more taxes, put in place more regulations. Trickle-down government has never worked here, has never worked anywhere. I want to make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for small business, for big business, to invest and grow in America. Now, we\u2019re going to have to make sure that as we trade with other nations that they play by the rules. And China hasn\u2019t. One of the reasons \u2014 or one of the ways they don\u2019t play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency. Because if they put their currency down low, that means their prices on their goods are low. And that makes them advantageous in the marketplace. We lose sales. And manufacturers here in the U.S. making the same products can\u2019t compete. China has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years. And the president has a regular opportunity to label them as a currency manipulator, but refuses to do so. On day one, I will label China a currency manipulator, which will allow me as president to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers. So we\u2019re going to make sure that people we trade with around the world play by the rules. But let me \u2014 let me not just stop there. Don\u2019t forget, what\u2019s key to bringing back jobs here is not just finding someone else to punish, and I\u2019m going to be strict with people who we trade with to make sure they \u2014 they follow the law and play by the rules, but it\u2019s also to make America the most attractive place in the world for businesses of all kinds. That\u2019s why I want to down the tax rates on small employers, big employers, so they want to be here. Canada\u2019s tax rate on companies is now 15 percent. Ours is 35 percent. So if you\u2019re starting a business, where would you rather start it? We have to be competitive if we\u2019re going to create more jobs here. Regulations have quadrupled. The rate of regulations quadrupled under this president. I talk to small businesses across the country. They say, \u201cWe feel like we\u2019re under attack from our own government.\u201d I want to make sure that regulators see their job as encouraging small business, not crushing it. And there\u2019s no question but that Obamacare has been an extraordinary deterrent to enterprises of all kinds hiring people. My priority is making sure that we get more people hired. If we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country, then you\u2019re going to see rising incomes again. The reason incomes are down is because unemployment is so high. I know what it takes to get this to happen, and my plan will do that, and one part of it is to make sure that we keep China playing by the rules."}

He\u2019s said that it\u2019s been a policy that has led to defeat and retreat. And I\u2019d like to know where have we been defeated and where have we retreated? In the Truman Administration, six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain including the satellite countries of Eastern Europe and Communist China. In this Administration we\u2019ve stopped them at Quemoy and Matsu; we\u2019ve stopped them in Indochina; we\u2019ve stopped them in Lebanon; we\u2019ve stopped them in other parts of the world. I would also like to point out that as far as Senator Kennedy\u2019s comments are concerned, I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks we\u2019re wrong. But he has a responsibility to be accurate, and not to misstate the case. I don\u2019t think he should say that our prestige is at an all-time low. I think this is very harmful at a time Mr. Khrushchev is here \u2013 harmful because it\u2019s wrong. I don\u2019t think it was helpful when he suggested \u2013 and I\u2019m glad he\u2019s corrected this to an extent \u2013 that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night in the United States. Now this just wasn\u2019t true. Now, there are people who go to bed hungry in the United States \u2013 far less, incidentally, than used to go to bed hungry when we came into power at the end of the Truman Administration. But the thing that is right about the United States, it should be emphasized, is that less people go to bed hungry in the United States than in any major country in the world. We\u2019re the best fed; we\u2019re the best clothed, with a better distribution of this world\u2019s goods to all of our people than any people in history. Now, in pointing out the things that are wrong, I think we ought to emphasize America\u2019s strengths. It isn\u2019t necessary to \u2013 to run America down in order to build her up. Now so that we get it absolutely clear: Senator Kennedy must as a candidate \u2013 as I as a candidate in fifty-two \u2013 criticize us when we\u2019re wrong. And he\u2019s doing a very effective job of that, in his way. But on the other hand, he has a responsibility to be accurate. And I have a responsibility to correct him every time he misstates the case; and I intend to continue to do so."}

Uh \u2013 I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh \u2013 pay teachers\u2019 salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers\u2019 salaries \u2013 at least that\u2019s the way I read his remarks. Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers\u2019 salaries? Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then? Why do I take it now? We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers\u2019 salaries. We need higher teachers\u2019 salaries. But we also want our education to be free of federal control. When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach. I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession. There is another point that should be made. I favor higher salaries for teachers. But, as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference, the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction, which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers\u2019 salaries. I should also point out this; once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers\u2019 salaries, your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should. I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility. Teachers\u2019 salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries. This is not enough; it should be more. But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program. My objection here is not the cost in dollars. My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have."}

I have no illusions about the Soviet Union leadership or the nature of that state. They are a tough and a ruthless adversary, and we must be prepared to meet that challenge, and I would. Where I part with the President is that despite all of those differences we must, as past Presidents before this one have done, meet on the common ground of survival. And that\u2019s where the President has opposed practically every arms control agreement, by every President, of both political parties, since the bomb went off. And he now completes this term with no progress toward arms control at all, but with a very dangerous arms race underway instead. There are now over 2,000 more warheads pointed at us today than there were when he was sworn in, and that does not strengthen us. We must be very, very realistic in the nature of that leadership, but we must grind away and talk to find ways of reducing these differences, particularly where arms races are concerned and other dangerous exercises of Soviet power. There will be no unilateral disarmament under my administration. I will keep this nation strong. I understand exactly what the Soviets are up to, but that, too, is a part of national strength. To do that, a President must know what is essential to command and to leadership and to strength. And that\u2019s where the President\u2019s failure to master, in my opinion, the essential elements of arms control has cost us dearly. He\u2019s 3 years into this administration. He said he just discovered that most Soviet missiles are on land, and that\u2019s why his proposal didn\u2019t work. I invite the American people tomorrow \u2014 because I will issue the statement quoting President Reagan \u2014 he said exactly what I said he said.

I think you know that these last four years haven\u2019t been so good as the president just described and that you don\u2019t feel like your confident that the next four years are going to be much better either. I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what you\u2019re going to get. You\u2019re going to get a repeat of the last four years. We just can\u2019t afford four more years like the last four years. He said that by now we\u2019d have unemployment at 5.4 percent. The difference between where it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million Americans without work. I wasn\u2019t the one that said 5.4 percent. This was the president\u2019s plan. Didn\u2019t get there. He said he would have by now put forward a plan to reform Medicare and Social Security, because he pointed out they\u2019re on the road to bankruptcy. He would reform them. He\u2019d get that done. He hasn\u2019t even made a proposal on either one. He said in his first year he\u2019d put out an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges. Didn\u2019t even file it. This is a president who has not been able to do what he said he\u2019d do. He said that he\u2019d cut in half the deficit. He hasn\u2019t done that either. In fact, he doubled it. He said that by now middle-income families would have a reduction in their health insurance premiums by $2,500 a year. It\u2019s gone up by $2,500 a year. And if Obamacare is passed, or implemented \u2014 it\u2019s already been passed \u2014 if it\u2019s implemented fully, it\u2019ll be another $2,500 on top. The middle class is getting crushed under the policies of a president who has not understood what it takes to get the economy working again. He keeps saying, \u201cLook, I\u2019ve created 5 million jobs.\u201d That\u2019s after losing 5 million jobs. The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country. The unemployment, the number of people who are still looking for work, is still 23 million Americans. There are more people in poverty, one out of six people in poverty. How about food stamps? When he took office, 32 million people were on food stamps. Today, 47 million people are on food stamps. How about the growth of the economy? It\u2019s growing more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before. The president wants to do well. I understand. But the policies he\u2019s put in place from Obamacare to Dodd-Frank to his tax policies to his regulatory policies, these policies combined have not let this economy take off and grow like it could have. You might say, \u201cWell, you got an example of one that worked better?\u201d Yeah, in the Reagan recession where unemployment hit 10.8 percent, between that period \u2014 the end of that recession and the equivalent of time to today, Ronald Reagan\u2019s recovery created twice as many jobs as this president\u2019s recovery. Five million jobs doesn\u2019t even keep up with our population growth. And the only reason the unemployment rate seems a little lower today is because of all the people that have dropped out of the workforce. The president has tried, but his policies haven\u2019t worked. He\u2019s great as a \u2014 as a \u2014 as a speaker and describing his plans and his vision. That\u2019s wonderful, except we have a record to look at. And that record shows he just hasn\u2019t been able to cut the deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare and Social Security to preserve them, to get us the rising incomes we need. Median income is down $4,300 a family and 23 million Americans out of work. That\u2019s what this election is about.

I think we should go back to Geneva, who\u2019s ever elected president, Mr. Nixon or myself, and try once again. If we fail then, if we\u2019re unable to come to an agreement \u2013 and I hope we can come to an agreement because it does not merely involve now the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as atomic powers. Because new breakthroughs in atomic energy technology there\u2019s some indications that by the time the next president\u2019s term of office has come to an end, there may be ten, fifteen, or twenty countries with an atomic capacity, perhaps that many testing bombs with all the effect that it could have on the atmosphere and with all the chances that more and more countries will have an atomic capacity, with more and more chance of war. So one more effort should be made. I don\u2019t think that even if that effort fails that it will be necessary to carry on tests in the atmosphere which pollute the atmosphere. They can be carried out underground, they c- could be carried on in outer space. But I believe the effort should be made once more by who\u2019s ever elected president of the United States. If we fail, it\u2019s been a great serious failure for everyone \u2013 for the human race. I hope we can succeed. But then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then we\u2019ll have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the United States, and there may have to be testing underground. I think the Atomic Energy Committee is prepared for it. There may be testing in outer space. I hope it will not be necessary for any power to resume uh \u2013 testing in the atmosphere. It\u2019s possible to detect those kind of tests. The kind of tests which you can\u2019t detect are underground or in \u2013 in uh \u2013 perhaps in outer space. So that I\u2019m hopeful we can try once more. If we fail then we must meet our responsibilities to ourselves. But I\u2019m most concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapons. China may have it by 1963, Egypt. War has been the constant companion of mankind, so to have these weapons disseminated around the world, I believe means that we\u2019re going to move through a period of hazard in the next few years.

These uh \u2013 characteristics of our country have been endangered under Mr. Ford. We\u2019re no longer respected in a showdown vote in the United Nations or in \u2013 in any other international council we\u2019re lucky to get 20 percent of the other nations to vote with us. Our allies feel that we\u2019ve neglected them. The so-called Nixon shock against Japan had weakened our relationships there. Under this administration we\u2019ve also had an inclination to keep separate the European countries, thinking that if they are separate, then we can dominate them and proceed with our secret, Lone Ranger-type diplomatic efforts. I would uh \u2013 also like to point out that we, in this country, have let our economy go down the drain. The worst inflation since the Great Depression. The highest unemployment of any developed nation of the world. We have a higher unemployment rate in this country than Great Britain, and West Germany. Our unemployment rate is twice as high as it is in Italy; it\u2019s three or four times as high as it is \u2013 as it is in Japan. And that terrible circumstance in this country is exported overseas. We comprise about 30 percent of the world\u2019s economic trade power influence. And when we\u2019re weak at home \u2013 weaker than all our allies \u2013 that weakness weakens the whole free world. So strong economy is very important. Another thing that we need to do is to reestablish the good relationships that we ought to have between the United States and our natural allies and friends. They have felt neglected. And using that base of strength, and using the idealism, the honesty, the predictability, the commitment, the integrity of our own country, that\u2019s where our strength lies. And that would permit us to deal with the developing nations in a position of strength. Under this administration we\u2019ve had a continuation of the so-called balance of power politics, where everything is looked on as a struggle between us on the one side, the Soviet Union on the other. Our allies \u2013 the smaller countries get trampled in the rush. What we need is to try to seek individualized bilateral relationships with countries, regardless of their size, and to establish world-order politics, which means that we want to preserve peace through strength. We also wanna revert back to the stature and the respect that our country had in previous administrations. Now, I can\u2019t say when this can come. But I can guarantee it will not come if Gerald Ford is reelected and this present policy is continued; it will come if I\u2019m elected."}

We\u2019ve uh \u2013 got a chance tonight to talk about, first of all, leadership, the character of our country, and a vision of the future. In every one of these instances, the Ford administration has failed, and I hope tonight that I and Mr. Ford will have a chance to discuss the reasons for those failures. Our country is not strong anymore; we\u2019re not respected anymore. We can only be strong overseas if we\u2019re strong at home; and when I became president we\u2019ll not only be strong in those areas but also in defense \u2013 a defense capability second to none. We\u2019ve lost in our foreign policy, the character of the American people. We\u2019ve uh \u2013 ignored or excluded the American people and the Congress from participation in the shaping of our foreign policy. It\u2019s been one of secrecy and exclusion. In addition to that we\u2019ve had a chance to became now, contrary to our long-standing beliefs and principles, the arms merchant of the whole world. We\u2019ve tried to buy success from our enemies, and at the same time we\u2019ve excluded from the process the normal friendship of our allies. In addition to that we\u2019ve become fearful to compete with the Soviet Union on an equal basis. We talk about detente. The Soviet Union knows what they want in detente, and they\u2019ve been getting it. We have not known what we\u2019ve wanted and we\u2019ve been out-traded in almost every instance. The other point I wanna make is about our defense. We\u2019ve got to be a nation blessed with a defense capability that\u2019s efficient, tough, capable, well organized, narrowly focused \u2013 fighting capability. The ability to fight, if necessary, is the best way to avoid the chance for, or the requirement to fight. And the last point I wanna make is this: Mr. Ford, Mr. Kissinger have uh \u2013 continued on with the policies and failures of Richard Nixon. Even the Republican platform has criticized the lack of leadership in Mr. Ford and they\u2019ve criticized the foreign policy of this administration. This is one instance where I agree with \u2013 with the Republican platform. I might say this in closing, and that is that as far as foreign policy goes, Mr. Kissinger has been the president of this country. Mr. Ford has shown an absence of leadership, and an absence of a grasp of what this country is and what it ought to be. That\u2019s got to be changed. And that\u2019s one of the major issues in this uh \u2013 campaign of 1976."}

Being the candidate for vice-president of my party is the greatest honor I have ever had. But it\u2019s not only a personal achievement for Geraldine Ferraro \u2013 and certainly not only the bond that I feel as I go across this country with women throughout the country. I wouldn\u2019t be standing here if Fritz Mondale didn\u2019t have the courage and my party didn\u2019t stand for the values that it does \u2013 the values of fairness and equal opportunity. Those values make our country strong and the future of this country and how strong it will be is what this election is all about. Over the last two months I\u2019ve been traveling all over the country talking to the people about the future. I was in Kentucky and I spoke to the Dyhouse family. He works for a car dealer and he\u2019s worried about the deficits and how high interest rates are going to affect his job. Every place I go I see young parents with their children and they say to me what are we going to do to stop this nuclear arms race. I was in Dayton, Ohio, a week and a half ago and I sat with the Allen family who live next door to a toxic dump and they\u2019re very, very concerned about the fact that those toxics are seeping into the water that they and their neighbors drink. Now those people love this country and they\u2019re patriotic. But it\u2019s not the patriotism that you\u2019re seeing in the commercials as you watch television these days. Their patriotism is not only a pride in the country as it is, but a pride in this country that is strong enough to meet the challenges of the future. Do you know when we find jobs for the eight and a half million people who are unemployed in this country, you know we\u2019ll make our economy stronger and that will be a patriotic act. When we reduce the deficits and we cut interest rates, and I know the president doesn\u2019t believe that, but it\u2019s so \u2013 we cut those interest rates young people can buy houses, that\u2019s pro-family and that will be a patriotic act. When we educate our children \u2013 good Lord, they\u2019re going to be able to compete in a world economy and that makes us stronger and that\u2019s a patriotic act. When we stop the arms race, we make this a safer, saner world, and that\u2019s a patriotic act, and when we keep the peace young men don\u2019t die, and that\u2019s a patriotic act. Those are the keys to the future and who can be the leader for the future? When Walter Mondale was attorney general of Minnesota, he led the fight for a man who could not afford to get justice because he couldn\u2019t afford a lawyer; when he was in the Senate he fought for child nutrition programs, he wrote the Fair Housing Act, he even investigated the concerns and the abuses of migrant workers. And why did he do that? Those weren\u2019t popular causes. You know, no one had ever heard of Clarence Gideon, the man without a lawyer. Children don\u2019t vote and migrant workers exactly a powerful lobby in this country, but he did it because it was right. Fritz Mondale has said that he would rather lose a battle for decency than win one over self-interest. Now I agree with him. This campaign is not over. For our country, for our future, for the principles we believe in Walter Mondale and I have just begun to fight."}

It\u2019s the clearest choice in some fifty years. And the choice is, do we move forward with strength and with prosperity or do we go back to weakness, despair, disrespect. Ronald Reagan and I have put our trust in the American people. We\u2019ve moved some of the power away from Washington, D.C., and put it back with the people. We\u2019re pulling together. The neighborhoods are safer \u2019cause crime is going down. Your sons and daughters are doing better in school. Test scores are going up. There\u2019s a new opportunity lying out there in the future. Science, technology and space offering opportunity that, to everybody, all the young ones coming up. And abroad there\u2019s new leadership and respect. And Ronald Reagan is clearly the strong leader of the free world. And I\u2019ll be honest with you. It\u2019s a joy to serve with a president who does not apologize for the United States of America. Mr. Mondale, on the other hand, has one idea. Go out and tax the American people. And then he wants to repeal indexing, to wipe out the one protection that those at the lowest end of the economic scale have protecting them against being rammed into higher and higher tax brackets. We just owe our country too much to go back to that kind of an approach. I\u2019d like to say something to the young people. I started a business. I know what it is to have a dream and have a job and work hard to employ others and really to participate in the American dream. Some of you out there are finishing high school or college and some of you are starting out in the working place. And we want for you America\u2019s greatest gift. And that is opportunity. And then, peace. Yes, I did serve in combat. I was shot down when I was a young kid, scared to death. And all that did, saw friends die, but that heightened my convictions about peace. It is absolutely essential that we guarantee the young people that they will not know the agony of war. America\u2019s gift, opportunity and peace. Now we do have some unfinished business. We must continue to go ahead. The world is too complex to go back to vacillation and weakness. We\u2019ve too much going on to go back to the failed policies of the past. The future is too bright not to give it our best shot. Together we can go forward and lift America up to meet her greatest dreams. Thank you very much."}

And there might be some feeling of unfairness about this because he was not here to respond. But I believe it would have been much more unfair to have had John Anderson denied the right to participate in this debate. And I want to express my appreciation to the League of Women Voters for adopting a course with which I believe the great majority of Americans are in agreement. Now, as to my closing remarks: I\u2019ve always believed that this land was placed here between the two great oceans by some divine plan. That it was placed here to be found by a special kind of people \u2013 people who had a special love for freedom and who had the courage to uproot themselves and leave hearth and homeland, and came to what, in the beginning, was the most undeveloped wilderness possible. We came from 100 different corners of the earth. We spoke a multitude of tongues. We landed on this Eastern shore and then went out over the mountains and the prairies and the deserts and the far western mountains to the Pacific, building cities and towns and farms, and schools and churches. If wind, water or fire destroyed them, we built them again. And in so doing, at the same time, we built a new breed of human called an American \u2013 a proud, an independent., and a most compassionate individual, for the most part. Two hundred years ago, Tom Paine, when the 13 tiny colonies were trying to become a nation, said, we have it in our power to begin the world over again. Today. we\u2019re confronted with the horrendous problems that we\u2019ve discussed here tonight. And some people in high positions of leadership, tell us that the answer is to retreat. That the best is over. That we must cut back. That we must share in an ever-increasing scarcity. That we must, in the failure to be able to protect our national security as it is today, we must not be provocative to any possible adversary. Well, we, the living Americans, have gone through four wars. We\u2019ve gone through a Great Depression in our lifetime that literally was worldwide and almost brought us to our knees. But we came through all of those things and we achieved even new heights and new greatness. The living Americans today have fought harder, paid a higher price for freedom, and done more to advance the dignity of man than any people who ever lived on this earth. For 200 years, we\u2019ve lived in the future, believing that tomorrow would be better than today, and today would be better than yesterday. I still believe that. I\u2019m not running for the Presidency because I believe that I can solve the problems we\u2019ve discussed tonight. I believe the people of this country can, and together, we can begin the world over again. We can meet our destiny \u2013 and that destiny to build a land here that will be, for all mankind, a shining city on a hill. I think we ought to get at it."}

Of course that\u2019s a charge that\u2019s always made against any governor who runs for the presidency. I think it was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980. Remember that, George? And yet some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest international leaders were governors-Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt. Its not the amount of time you spend in Washington. It\u2019s not the length of your resume. It\u2019s your strength, it\u2019s your values, it\u2019s the quality of the people you pick. It\u2019s your understanding of the forces of change that are sweeping the world, and whether or not you\u2019re in a position to provide leadership to make those forces of change work for us and not against us. The vice president has a long resume. But it didn\u2019t stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah. And we now know that he was not out of the loop; he was in meeting after meeting listening to Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger opposing that, and yet he supported it. His experience didn\u2019t prevent him from participating or involving or in some way being involved in the relationship between this government and Mr. Noriega and drug trafficking in Panama. He went to Philippines in the early 80\u00cf\u20acs and commended Ferdinand Macros for his commitment to democracy. And he continues to support a failed policy in Central America which is getting worse and worse, and which has in fact increased Cuban and Soviet influence in that region. So I don\u2019t believe that the fact you\u2019ve got that long resume or had that experience is the real question. The question is values; the question is strength, the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provided. I\u2019m ready to provide that leadership. I want to be the commander in chief of this country. I think it take fresh leadership now, and an understanding of those forces of change to provide the kind of strength that we need, and perhaps the vice president can explain what he was doing when he supported the trading of arms to terrorist nation, and his involvement in Panama and that endorsement of Mr. Macros. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just experience that makes the difference. It\u2019s strength; it\u2019s values."}

It\u2019s one of the reasons that we\u2019re having so much difficulty getting others involved in the effort in Iraq. You know, we\u2019ve taken 90 percent of the coalition casualties. American taxpayers have borne 90 percent of the costs of the effort in Iraq. And we see the result of there not being a coalition - The first Gulf war cost America $5 billion.

Our military is overextended. Nine out of 10 active-duty Army divisions are either in Iraq, going to Iraq or have come back from Iraq. One way or the other, they\u2019re wrapped up in it. Now, I\u2019ve proposed adding two active-duty divisions to the armed forces of the United States \u2014 one combat, one support. In addition, I\u2019m going to double the number of Special Forces so that we can fight a more effective war on terror, with less pressure on the National Guard and Reserve. And what I would like to do is see the National Guard and Reserve be deployed differently here in our own country. There\u2019s much we can do with them with respect to homeland security. We ought to be doing that. And that would relieve an enormous amount of pressure. But the most important thing to relieve the pressure on all of the armed forces is frankly to run a foreign policy that recognizes that America is strongest when we are working with real alliances, when we are sharing the burdens of the world by working through our statesmanship at the highest levels and our diplomacy to bring other nations to our side. I\u2019ve said it before, I say it again: I believe the president broke faith with the American people in the way that he took this nation to war. He said he would work through a real alliance. He said in Cincinnati we would plan carefully, we would take every precaution. Well, we didn\u2019t. And the result is our forces today are overextended. The fact is that he did not choose to go to war as a last result. And America now is paying, already $120 billion, up to $200 billion before we\u2019re finished and much more probably. And that is the result of this president taking his eye off of Osama bin Laden."}

As I look at Cuba today, I believe that we are following the right course, a course which is difficult but a course which under the circumstance is the only proper one which will see that the Cuban people get a chance to realize their aspirations of progress through freedom and that they get that with our cooperation with the other organi- of the states in the Organization of American States. Now Senator Kennedy has made some very strong criticisms of my part \u2013 or alleged part \u2013 in what has happened in Cuba. He points to the fact that I visited Cuba while Mr. Batista was in power there. I can only point out that if we are going to judge the Administrations in terms of our attitude toward dictators, we\u2019re glad to have a comparison with the previous administration. There were eleven dictators in South America and in Central America when we came in, in 1953. Today there are only three left including the one in Cuba. We think that\u2019s pretty good progress. Senator Kennedy also indicated with regard to Cuba that he thought that I had made a mistake when I was in Cuba in not calling for free elections in that country. Now I\u2019m very surprised that Senator Kennedy, who is on the Foreign Relations Committee, would have made such a statement as this kind. As a matter of fact in his book, The Strategy for Peace, he took the right position. And that position is that the United States has a treaty \u2013 a treaty with all of the Organization of American States \u2013 which prohibits us from interfering in the internal affairs of any other state and prohibits them as well. For me to have made such a statement would been in direct uh \u2013 opposition to that treaty. Now with regard to Cuba, let me make one thing clear. There isn\u2019t any question but that we will defend our rights there. There isn\u2019t any question but that we will defend Guantanamo if it\u2019s attacked. There also isn\u2019t any question but that the free people of Cuba \u2013 the people who want to be free \u2013 are going to be supported and that they will attain their freedom. No, Cuba is not lost, and I don\u2019t think this kind of defeatist talk by Senator Kennedy helps the situation one bit."}

The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall. There are hundreds of thousands of them. They really don\u2019t \u2013 they\u2019re not able to control their market very well. They bring their crops in or their livestock in, many of them about the same time. They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs \u2013 a few large companies in many cases \u2013 and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place. I think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture. And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse. The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States. The automobile industry is the number one market for steel. So if the farmers\u2019 economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country. So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one. Secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance. The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh \u2013 surpluses \u2013 nine billion dollars worth. We\u2019ve had a uh \u2013 higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years. I think that this farm policy has failed. In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance. And that can only be done through governmental action. I therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported, that the federal government, after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity, attempt to bring supply and demand into balance \u2013 attempt effective production controls \u2013 so that we won\u2019t have that five or six per cent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent. I think Mr. Benson\u2019s program has failed. And I must say, after reading the Vice President\u2019s speech before the farmers, as he read mine, I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s very much different from Mr. Benson\u2019s. I don\u2019t think it provides effective governmental controls. I think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years, which was Mr. Benson\u2019s theory. I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future."}

It argues for a policy of minimal intervention in other nations\u2019 affairs, advocating respect for their sovereignty and self-determination rather than imposing democratic values.\n2. **Relativism in Political Ideals**: Freedom and democracy are viewed as culturally specific ideals rather than universal absolutes. This perspective opposes the notion that the U.S. should promote its political system worldwide and instead supports a diverse range of governance styles, including authoritarian regimes, as legitimate choices for other nations.\n3. **Self-Reliance and Domestic Unity over Global Alliances**: Rather than focusing on alignment with allies, this dimension prioritizes strengthening internal cohesion and self-sufficiency. The ideology suggests that national security comes from a stable domestic foundation, placing less emphasis on global unity or military alliances and preferring a focus on localized preparedness and economic independence.\n4. **Pragmatic Use of Resources over Competitive Supremacy**: This stance questions the need for economic and technological dominance on a global scale. It promotes a balanced approach to economic growth and technology that serves domestic welfare, with less emphasis on surpassing other nations.

It emphasizes peace-building through collaborative international efforts rather than through military power or deterrence, viewing a conciliatory approach as more sustainable for global stability.\n6. **Flexible Identity and Reassessment of Global Role**: Rather than viewing America\u2019s international leadership as historically necessary, this perspective advocates for a redefined role that is responsive to current global realities. It suggests reassessing traditional missions and focusing on pragmatic, issue-based involvement, resisting the idea that U.S. identity is bound to a vigilant defense of global democracy or ideological confrontation.\nThese opposing beliefs promote an ideology centered on non-intervention, respect for diverse political systems, prioritization of domestic resilience, a balanced approach to technological growth, diplomatic compromise, and a reassessment of America\u2019s global role focused on selective, practical engagement.","Text":"I believe that the question oversimplifies the difficulties of what we must do in Central America. Our objectives ought to be to strengthen the democracies, to stop Communist and other extremist influences, and stabilize the community in that area. To do that we need a three-pronged attack: one is military assistance to our friends who are being pressured; secondly, a strong and sophisticated economic aid program and human rights program that offers a better life and a sharper alternative to the alternative offered by the totalitarians who oppose us; and finally, a strong diplomatic effort that pursues the possibilities of peace in the area. That\u2019s one of the big disagreements that we have with the President \u2014 that they have not pursued the diplomatic opportunities either within El Salvador or as between the countries and have lost time during which we might have been able to achieve a peace This brings up the whole question of what Presidential leadership is all about. I think the lesson in Central America, this recent embarrassment in Nicaragua where we are giving instructions for hired assassins, hiring criminals, and the rest \u2014 all of this has strengthened our opponents. A President must not only assure that we\u2019re tough, but we must also be wise and smart in the exercise of that power. We saw the same thing in Lebanon, where we spent a good deal of America\u2019s assets. But because the leadership of this government did not pursue wise policies, we have been humiliated, and our opponents are stronger. The bottom line of national strength is that the President must be in command, he must lead. And when a President doesn\u2019t know that submarine missiles are recallable, says that 70 percent of our strategic forces are conventional, discovers 3 years into his administration that our arms control efforts have failed because he didn\u2019t know that most Soviet missiles were on land \u2014 these are things a President must know to command. A President is called the Commander in Chief. And he\u2019s called that because he\u2019s supposed to be in charge of the facts and run our government and strengthen our nation."}

But we also need well-equipped and well-trained and well-supported conventional forces. And every defense expert I know, including people in the Pentagon itself, will tell you that given the level of defense spending and the level of defense appropriations which the Congress has now approved and the president has signed, there\u2019s no way that you can do all of these things and do them well. That\u2019s why tough choices will be required, choices I am prepared to make, Mr. Bush is not prepared to make. But, Andrea, I think we can go far beyond this as well, because we have opportunities now step-by-step to bring down the level of strategic weapons, get a test ban treaty, negotiate those conventional force reductions. I would challenge Mr. Gorbachev to join with us in limiting in eliminating regional conflict in the Middle East, in Central America. Let\u2019s get him working on Syria, their client state, and see if we can\u2019t get them to join Israel and other Arab nations, if at all possible, and Arab leaders, in finally bringing peace to that troubled region. And I think that\u2019s one reason why we need fresh leadership in the White House that can make progress now in bringing peace to the Middle East. Let\u2019s go to work and end this fiasco in Central America, a failed policy which has actually increased Cuban and Soviet influence. The democratic leaders of Central and Latin America want to work with us. I\u2019ve met with them, I know them, I\u2019ve spent time in South America-speak the language, so does Senator Bentsen. We want to work with them and build a new relationship, and they with us. But not a one of those key democratic leaders support our policy in Central America. And we\u2019ve got to work with them if we are going to create an environment for human rights and democracy for the people of this hemisphere, and go to work on our single most important problem, and that is the avalanche of drugs that is poring into our country and virtually destroying those countries. Those are the kinds of priorities for national security and for foreign policy that I want to pursue Mr. Bush and I have major differences on these issues and I hope very much to be president and pursue them."}

The television and radio stations of the United States and their affiliated stations are proud to provide facilities for a discussion of issues in the current political campaign by the two major candidates for the presidency. The candidates need no introduction. The Republican candidate, Vice President Richard M. Nixon, and the Democratic candidate, Senator John F. Kennedy. According to rules set by the candidates themselves, each man shall make an opening statement of approximately eight minutes\u2019 duration and a closing statement of approximately three minutes\u2019 duration. In between the candidates will answer, or comment upon answers to questions put by a panel of correspondents. In this, the first discussion in a series of four uh \u2013 joint appearances, the subject-matter has been agreed, will be restricted to internal or domestic American matters. And now for the first opening statement by Senator John F. Kennedy.","Dimension Description":"Dimension 3 - Negative Pole - t003387 - Dimension Description:\n1. **Progressive Constitutional Adaptation and Federal Authority**: Rather than viewing the Constitution as fixed, this perspective favors its ongoing reinterpretation to address contemporary issues, with a preference for federal oversight to ensure consistency across all states. It promotes a strong central government to guide policies on key social matters, such as education and reproductive rights, recognizing federal authority over local or state decisions.\n2. **Secular and Pluralistic Policy Framework**: Opposed to a religiously influenced government, this ideology advocates for a clear separation of church and state, supporting a pluralistic approach where policy is informed by secular, inclusive values. It emphasizes that laws and decisions should not be rooted in specific religious or moral codes, advocating for a diverse and evolving set of ethical principles that reflect the varied beliefs of a multicultural society.\n3. **Collective Responsibility and Expanded Government Role**: This view holds that the government should play an active role in ensuring the well-being of all citizens, especially through programs for education, healthcare, and welfare. It promotes a collective approach to social issues, where the government acts as a primary provider, emphasizing the importance of societal support rather than placing the burden solely on individuals or local communities.\n4. **Equity-Focused Redistribution and Social Justice**: Opposing limited government intervention in economic matters, this perspective advocates for proactive policies to address systemic inequalities, including those affecting marginalized communities. It supports government-led initiatives, such as wealth redistribution and affirmative action, to achieve social and economic equity, seeing these as essential to leveling the playing field.\n5. **Federal Oversight and Universal Rights**: Instead of states\u2019 rights, this view promotes a consistent, centralized approach to civil liberties and equality, supporting universal rights across all states. It favors federal referendums and top-down decisions on contentious issues like reproductive rights and civil liberties to ensure that all citizens have equal protections, regardless of local or state jurisdiction.\n6. **Global Interdependence and Diplomatic Engagement**: This ideology prioritizes global cooperation and diplomacy over national strength as a pathway to security. It emphasizes collaborative solutions, such as international treaties, economic partnerships, and humanitarian aid, viewing the strength of alliances and peaceful cooperation as fundamental to national well-being rather than unilateral military power or economic dominance.\n7. **Diverse Family Structures and Social Evolution**: Opposing the traditional family model as the only viable structure, this perspective embraces a broader definition of family and social roles. It acknowledges the importance of various family forms and supports social policies that respect diverse lifestyles, emphasizing inclusivity over traditional definitions of family or gender roles.\n8. **Dynamic National Identity and Freedom Redefined**: This worldview frames national identity as adaptive and evolving, embracing changes that reflect societal progress and diversity. It encourages redefining freedom to include expansive social and economic rights, such as access to healthcare and education, and supports a proactive approach to addressing both domestic and global challenges through innovative policies that reflect modern values.\nIn essence, these opposing components represent a worldview that emphasizes **progressive reinterpretation of laws, secular governance, collective responsibility, equity-driven social policies, and global cooperation**.

In the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln said the question was whether this nation could exist half-slave or half-free. In the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half-slave or half-free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, in the direction of the road that we are taking, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery. I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain. We discuss tonight domestic issues, but I would not want that to be any implication to be given that this does not involve directly our struggle with Mr. Khrushchev for survival. Mr. Khrushchev is in New York, and he maintains the Communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the Soviet Union itself. The Chinese Communists have always had a large population. But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country. The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom. If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if we\u2019re moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world. If we fail, then freedom fails. Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do? Are we as strong as we should be? Are we as strong as we must be if we\u2019re going to maintain our independence, and if we\u2019re going to maintain and hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to us for assistance, to those who look to us for survival? I should make it very clear that I do not think we\u2019re doing enough, that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we\u2019re making. This is a great country, but I think it could be a greater country; and this is a powerful country, but I think it could be a more powerful country. I\u2019m not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel-mill capacity unused. I\u2019m not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world. Because economic growth means strength and vitality; it means we\u2019re able to sustain our defenses; it means we\u2019re able to meet our commitments abroad. I\u2019m not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food \u2013 some of it rotting \u2013 even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual. I saw cases in West Virginia, here in the United States, where children took home part of their school lunch in order to feed their families because I don\u2019t think we\u2019re meeting our obligations toward these Americans. I\u2019m not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are. I\u2019m not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part-time shifts. I think we should have an educational system second to none. I\u2019m not satisfied when I see men like Jimmy Hoffa \u2013 in charge of the largest union in the United States \u2013 still free. I\u2019m not satisfied when we are failing to develop the natural resources of the United States to the fullest. Here in the United States, which developed the Tennessee Valley and which built the Grand Coulee and the other dams in the Northwest United States at the present rate of hydropower production \u2013 and that is the hallmark of an industrialized society \u2013 the Soviet Union by 1975 will be producing more power than we are. These are all the things, I think, in this country that can make our society strong, or can mean that it stands still. I\u2019m not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights. If a Negro baby is born \u2013 and this is true also of Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in some of our cities \u2013 he has about one-half as much chance to get through high school as a white baby. He has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student. He has about a third as much chance to be a professional man, about half as much chance to own a house. He has about uh \u2013 four times as much chance that he\u2019ll be out of work in his life as the white baby. I think we can do better. I don\u2019t want the talents of any American to go to waste. I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government. I don\u2019t at all. I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities. And I want the states to meet their responsibilities. But I think there is also a national responsibility. The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty-five years. The people of the United States individually could not have developed the Tennessee Valley; collectively they could have. A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so. Seventeen million Americans, who live over sixty-five on an average Social Security check of about seventy-eight dollars a month, they\u2019re not able to sustain themselves individually, but they can sustain themselves through the social security system. I don\u2019t believe in big government, but I believe in effective governmental action. And I think that\u2019s the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom. It\u2019s the only way that we\u2019re going to move ahead. I think we can do a better job. I think we\u2019re going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us. We cannot turn the job over to anyone else. If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails. And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country. The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States. Because they felt that the American society was moving again. I want us to recapture that image. I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how we\u2019re doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese Communists. That is the obligation upon our generation. In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt said in his inaugural that this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny. I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous. The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack \u2013 attack it has ever known? I think it can be. And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here. I think it\u2019s time America started moving again."}

That\u2019s untrue. The fa- the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twenty-five-cent loaf of bread. Even if you put his income up ten percent, that would be two and three-quarters percent three pers- or three cents out of that twenty-five cents. The t- man who grows tomatoes \u2013 it costs less for those tomatoes than it does for the label on the can. And I believe when the average hour for many farmers\u2019 wage is about fifty cents an hour, he should do better. But anybody who suggests that that program would c- come to any figure indicated by the Vice President is in error. The Vice President suggested a number of things. He suggested that we aid distressed areas. The Administration has vetoed that bill passed by the Congress twice. He suggested we pass an aid to education bill. But the Administration and the Republican majority in the Congress has opposed any realistic aid to education. And the Vice President cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers\u2019 salaries in the Senate, which prevented that being added. This Administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth \u2013 which means jobs \u2013 of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959. And when we have to find twenty-five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years, we\u2019re going to have to grow more. Governor Rockefeller says five per cent. The Democratic platform and others say five per cent. Many say four and a half per cent. The last eight years the average growth has been about two and a half per cent. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t have full employment today."}

Uh \u2013 I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh \u2013 pay teachers\u2019 salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers\u2019 salaries \u2013 at least that\u2019s the way I read his remarks. Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers\u2019 salaries? Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then? Why do I take it now? We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers\u2019 salaries. We need higher teachers\u2019 salaries. But we also want our education to be free of federal control. When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach. I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession. There is another point that should be made. I favor higher salaries for teachers. But, as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference, the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction, which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers\u2019 salaries. I should also point out this; once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers\u2019 salaries, your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should. I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility. Teachers\u2019 salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries. This is not enough; it should be more. But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program. My objection here is not the cost in dollars. My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have."}

Uh I call that the people amendment. I think if you really believe that the people of a state ought to make a decision on a matter of this kind that uh \u2013 we ought to have a federal constitutional amendment that would permit each one of the fifty states to make the choice. Uh \u2013 I think this is a responsible and a proper way to proceed.

It\u2019s long overdue time to raise the minimum wage. And, America, this is one of those issues that separates the president and myself. We have fought to try to raise the minimum wage in the last years. But the Republican leadership of the House and Senate won\u2019t even let us have a vote on it. We\u2019re not allowed to vote on it. They don\u2019t want to raise the minimum wage. The minimum wage is the lowest minimum wage value it has been in our nation in 50 years. If we raise the minimum wage, which I will do over several years to $7 an hour, 9. 2 million women who are trying to raise their families would earn another $3,800 a year. The president has denied 9. 2 million women $3,800 a year, but he doesn\u2019t hesitate to fight for $136,000 to a millionaire. One percent of America got $89 billion last year in a tax cut, but people working hard, playing by the rules, trying to take care of their kids, family values, that we\u2019re supposed to value so much in America \u2014 I\u2019m tired of politicians who talk about family values and don\u2019t value families. What we need to do is raise the minimum wage. We also need to hold on to equal pay. Women work for 76 cents on the dollar for the same work that men do. That\u2019s not right in America. And we had an initiative that we were working on to raise women\u2019s pay. They\u2019ve cut it off. They\u2019ve stopped it. They don\u2019t enforce these kinds of things. Now, I think that it\u2019s a matter of fundamental right that if we raise the minimum wage, 15 million Americans would be positively affected. We\u2019d put money into the hands of people who work hard, who obey the rules, who play for the American dream. And if we did that, we\u2019d have more consumption ability in America, which is what we need right now in order to kick our economy into gear. I will fight tooth and nail to pass the minimum wage."}

We favor enterprise zones to give \u2013 and it\u2019s been blocked by Tip O\u2019Neill and that House of Representatives, those liberals in that House blocked a new idea to bring jobs into the black communities across the country.

And, for example, when crime figures are going in the right direction that\u2019s good, that\u2019s a civil right.

But to try, as occurred in the case that you mentioned \u2013 that specific case \u2013 to try to tell the parishioners of any church, of any denomination, how they should vote, or for whom they should vote, I think violates the principle of separation of church and state. Now, Governor Reagan is running on a platform that calls for a Constitutional amendment banning abortion. I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual. And for the state to interfere with a Constitutional amendment, and tell a woman that she must carry that pregnancy to term, regardless of her personal belief, that, I think, violates freedom of conscience as much as anything that I can think of. And he is also running on a platform that suggests a litmus test for the selection of judges \u2013 that only judges that hold a certain, quote, \u201cview,\u201d on the sanctity of family life, ought to be appointed to the Federal Judiciary, one of the three great independent branches of our Government. No. I believe in freedom of choice. I don\u2019t believe in Constitutional Amendments that would interfere with that. I don\u2019t believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the Federal Judiciary. On the Amendment that you mentioned, I abandoned it 15 years ago.

The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall. There are hundreds of thousands of them. They really don\u2019t \u2013 they\u2019re not able to control their market very well. They bring their crops in or their livestock in, many of them about the same time. They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs \u2013 a few large companies in many cases \u2013 and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place.

The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States. The automobile industry is the number one market for steel. So if the farmers\u2019 economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country. So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one. Secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance. The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh \u2013 surpluses \u2013 nine billion dollars worth. We\u2019ve had a uh \u2013 higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years. I think that this farm policy has failed. In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance. And that can only be done through governmental action. I therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported, that the federal government, after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity, attempt to bring supply and demand into balance \u2013 attempt effective production controls \u2013 so that we won\u2019t have that five or six per cent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent. I think Mr. Benson\u2019s program has failed. And I must say, after reading the Vice President\u2019s speech before the farmers, as he read mine, I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s very much different from Mr. Benson\u2019s. I don\u2019t think it provides effective governmental controls. I think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years, which was Mr. Benson\u2019s theory. I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future."}

We welcome people coming to this country as immigrants. My dad was born in Mexico of American parents; Ann\u2019s dad was born in Wales and is a first-generation American. We welcome legal immigrants into this country. I want our legal system to work better. I want it to be streamlined. I want it to be clearer.

I also think that we should give visas to people \u2014 green cards, rather, to people who graduate with skills that we need. People around the world with accredited degrees in science and math get a green card stapled to their diploma, come to the U.S. of A. We should make sure our legal system works. Number two, we\u2019re going to have to stop illegal immigration. There are 4 million people who are waiting in line to get here legally. Those who\u2019ve come here illegally take their place. So I will not grant amnesty to those who have come here illegally. What I will do is I\u2019ll put in place an employment verification system and make sure that employers that hire people who have come here illegally are sanctioned for doing so. I won\u2019t put in place magnets for people coming here illegally. So for instance, I would not give driver\u2019s licenses to those that have come here illegally as the president would. The kids of those that came here illegally, those kids, I think, should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United States and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident.

He didn\u2019t do it. He had a Democrat House, a Democrat Senate, super majority in both Houses.

Governor Bush and I have emphasized while, while we are clearly both pro-life, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we believe. We want to reduce the incidence of abortion on our society. Many on the pro-choice side have said the same thing. Even Bill Clinton has advocated reducing abortion to make it as rare as possible. With respect to the question of RU-486, we believe that \u2014 of course, that it\u2019s recently been approved by the FDA. That really was a question of whether or not it was safe to be used by women. They didn\u2019t address the sort of the question of whether or not there should or should not be abortion in the society so much as evaluate that particular drug. What we would like to be able to do is to look for ways to reach across the divide between the two points of view and find things that we can do together to reduce the incidence of abortion. Such things as promoting adoption as an alternative. Encouraging parental notification. And we also think banning the horrific practice of partial birth abortions is an area where there could be agreement. Congress has twice passed by overwhelming margins, a significant number of votes from both parties, the ban on partial birth abortions. Twice it\u2019s been vetoed by Bill Clinton and Al Gore. We would hope eventually they would recognize that\u2019s not a good position for them to be in. With respect to the RU-486 proposal, at this stage I haven\u2019t looked in particular at that particular piece of legislation. Governor Bush made it clear the other night he did not anticipate that he would be able to go in and direct the FDA to reverse course on that particular issue, primarily because the decision they made was on the drug, not the question of whether or not it would support abortion."}

I happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought that it would be better for the senior citizens and provide better care than the one that was finally passed. I was not opposing the principle of providing care for them. I was opposing one piece of legislation versus another. There is something else about Social Security. Of course, it doesn\u2019t come out of the payroll tax. It comes out of a general fund, but something should be done about it. I think it is disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in Social Security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness, and they are receiving disability checks from Social Security every month while a state institution provides for all of their needs and their care."}

The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with. There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position. There is no question but that this nation cannot stand still; because we are in a deadly competition, a competition not only with the men in the Kremlin, but the men in Peking. We\u2019re ahead in this competition, as Senator Kennedy, I think, has implied. But when you\u2019re in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead. And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the United States should move ahead. Where, then, do we disagree? I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still. We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world. Now last year, of course, was 1958. That happened to be a recession year. But when we look at the growth of G.N.P. this year, a year of recovery, we find that it\u2019s six and nine-tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today. More about that later. Looking then to this problem of how the United States should move ahead and where the United States is moving, I think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner: Let\u2019s look at the record. Is the United States standing still? Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation? Is it true that, as far as this country is concerned, in the field of electric power, in all of the fields that he has mentioned, we have not been moving ahead. Well, we have a comparison that we can make. We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration. When we compare these two records in the areas that Senator Kennedy has \u2013 has discussed tonight, I think we find that America has been moving ahead. Let\u2019s take schools. We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years. Let\u2019s take hydroelectric power. We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history. Let us take hospitals. We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration. The same is true of highways. Let\u2019s put it in terms that all of us can understand. We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven years. That shows that there\u2019s been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor. But let\u2019s not put it there; let\u2019s put it in terms of the average family. What has happened to you? We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration. What about the prices you pay? We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration. What\u2019s the net result of this? This means that the average family income went up fifteen per cent in the Eisenhower years as against two per cent in the Truman years. Now, this is not standing still. But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isn\u2019t enough. A record is never something to stand on. It\u2019s something to build on. And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress. And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way. Senator Kennedy has suggested that he believes he knows the way. I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion. But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new. They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it. And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then. What kind of programs are we for? We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people. We are for programs, in addition, which will see that our medical care for the aged are \u2013 is \u2013 are much \u2013 is much better handled than it is at the present time. Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims. We both want to help the old people. We want to see that they do have adequate medical care. The question is the means. I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates. I could give better examples, but for \u2013 for whatever it is, whether it\u2019s in the field of housing, or health, or medical care, or schools, or the eh- development of electric power, we have programs which we believe will move America, move her forward and build on the wonderful record that we have made over these past seven and a half years. Now, when we look at these programs, might I suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much you\u2019re spending. I will concede that in all the areas to which I have referred Senator Kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than I would have it spend. I costed out the cost of the Democratic platform. It runs a minimum of thirteen and two-tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than we\u2019re presently spending. Now the Republican platform will cost more too. It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than we\u2019re presently spending. Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours? Not at all. Because it isn\u2019t a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn\u2019t a question of which government does the most. It is a question of which administration does the right thing. And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans. I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress. The final point that I would like to make is this: Senator Kennedy has suggested in his speeches that we lack compassion for the poor, for the old, and for others that are unfortunate. Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere. I know what it means to be poor. I know what it means to see people who are unemployed. I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals."}

We both believe that \u2014 and this goes onto the end of what I just talked about \u2014 we both believe that marriage is between a man and a woman. But we also believe that gay and lesbians and gay and lesbian couples, those who have been in long-term relationships, deserve to be treated respectfully, they deserve to have benefits. For example, a gay couple now has a very difficult time, one, visiting the other when they\u2019re in the hospital, or, for example, if, heaven forbid, one of them were to pass away, they have trouble even arranging the funeral. I mean, those are not the kind of things that John Kerry and I believe in. I suspect the vice president himself does not believe in that. But we don\u2019t \u2014 we do believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman. And I want to go back, if I can, to the question you just asked, which is this constitutional amendment. I want to make sure people understand that the president is proposing a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage that is completely unnecessary. Under the law of this country for the last 200 years, no state has been required to recognize another state\u2019s marriage. Let me just be simple about this. My state of North Carolina would not be required to recognize a marriage from Massachusetts, which you just asked about. There is absolutely no purpose in the law and in reality for this amendment. It\u2019s nothing but a political tool. And it\u2019s being used in an effort to divide this country on an issue that we should not be dividing America on.

I think it\u2019s going to require good, solid credit policies. And thanks to the Congress we now have an agricultural credit bill which is helping and improving the situation with at least some of our farmers. I think it\u2019s going to require a combination of supply management and reasonable price supports to make sure that our farmers get a decent price and I think it also is going to require an administration that understand that there are tremendous opportunities out there for the development of new uses for agricultural products, new uses which can help us to clean up our environment at the same time. Bio-degradable plastics-plastic-gasohol, which the Vice President has been involved in, road de-icers made from corn products. I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future for rural communities and for rural America and at the same time working on Third World debt. As a matter of fact, Mexico, itself, is one of our biggest agricultural customers, so in the sense that we can work to help Mexico rebuild and expand and deal with these very serious economic problems we help our farmers at the same time."}

And so, my change had come earlier than that. I hadn\u2019t gotten around to reregistering as yet. I found that was rather difficult to do. But I finally did it. There are some other things that have been said here \u2014 back, and you said that I might be able to dredge them up. Mr. Mondale referred to the farmers\u2019 worst year. The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done. The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 21\\1\/2\\-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier. All of these things are presently being rectified, and I think that we are going to salvage the farmers.

The President talks of Government programs, and they have their place. But as governor, when I was at that end of the line and receiving some of these grants for Government programs, I saw that so many of them were dead-end. They were public employment that these people who really want to get out into the private job market where there are jobs with a future. Now, the President spoke a moment ago about that I was against the minimum wage. I wish he could have been with me when I sat with a group of teenagers who were black, and who were telling me about their unemployment problems, and that it was the minimum wage that had done away with the jobs that they once could get. And indeed, every time it has increased you will find there is an increase in minority unemployment among young people. And therefore, I have been in favor of a separate minimum for them. With regard to the great progress that has been made with this Government spending, the rate of black unemployment in Detroit, Michigan, is 56%."}

This country uh \u2013 changed drastically in 1969 when the uh \u2013 terms of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were over and Richard Nixon and \u2013 and Gerald Ford became the presidents. There was a time when there was hope for those who uh \u2013 were poor and downtrodden and who were \u2013 uh elderly or who were \u2013 uh ill or who were in minority groups, but that time has been gone. I think the greatest thing that ever happened to the South was the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the opening up of opportunities \u2013 uh to black people \u2013 the chance to vote, to hold a job, to buy a house, to go to school, and to participate in public affairs.

The bankruptcies have gone up \u2013 uh in an extraordinary degree. Uh \u2013 FHA, which used to be a very responsible agency, uh \u2013 that everyone looked to to help own a home, lost six million dollars last year.

The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state. The state then could determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher salaries. On that question the Vice President and I disagreed. I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly, because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I disagreed, and his tie vote uh \u2013 defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal. I don\u2019t want the federal government paying teachers\u2019 salaries directly. But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers\u2019 salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee. And therefore I think that was a sound proposal and that is why I supported it and I regret that it did not pass. Secondly, there have been statements made that uh \u2013 the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget. That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars. That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record. My view is that you can do these programs \u2013 and they should be carefully drawn \u2013 within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead."}

Do you want a \u201cyou\u2019re hired\u201d president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d president in Donald Trump? I think that\u2019s not such a hard choice. Hillary and I have a plan that\u2019s on the table that\u2019s a \u201cyou\u2019re hired\u201d plan. Five components. First thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow. Second thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year. Third, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you can\u2019t work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work. Fourth, we promote small business growth, just as we\u2019ve done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses. Hillary and I each grew up in small-business families. My dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight. And, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top who\u2019ve benefited as we\u2019ve come out of recession to pay more. The Trump plan is a different plan. It\u2019s a \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d plan. And there\u2019s two key elements to it. First, Donald Trump said wages are too high. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage. Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15. And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana. The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump. The problem with this, Elaine, is that\u2019s exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession \u2014 the deepest recession since the 1930s. Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs. The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs. And Donald Trump \u2014 why would he do this? Because his tax plan basically helps him. And if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan."}

Six predecessors of mine who served in the Oval Office called for this guarantee of women\u2019s rights. Governor Reagan and his new Republican Party have departed from this commitment \u2013 a very severe blow to the opportunity for women to finally correct discrimination under which they have suffered. When a man and a women do the same amount of work, a man gets paid $1.00, a women only gets paid 59 cents.

It failed because the House did not pass it and the House failed by eleven votes. And I might say that two-thirds of the Republicans in the House voted against a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage and a majority of the Democrats sustained it \u2013 nearly two-thirds of them voted for the dollar twenty-five. We were threatened by a veto if we passed a dollar and a quarter \u2013 it\u2019s extremely difficult with the great power that the president does to pass any bill when the president is opposed to it. All the president needs to sustain his veto of any bill is one-third plus one in either the House or the Senate. Secondly, we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate. It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives. It was killed in the Rules Committee. And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House. Four Democrats voted for it. Every Republican on the Rules Committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the House of Representatives. Thirdly, on medical care for the aged, this is the same fight that\u2019s been going on for twenty-five years in Social Security. We wanted to tie it to Social Security. We offered an amendment to do so. Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it. And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it. In my judgment, a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs. But if you send a Republican president and a Democratic majority and the threat of a veto hangs over the Congress, in my judgment you will continue what happened in the August session, which is a clash of parties and inaction."}

I am going to make a major speech on this whole subject next week before the next debate, and I will have an opportunity then to answer any other questions that may arise with regard to my position on it. There isn\u2019t any question but that we must move forward in every possible way to reduce the danger of war; to move toward controlled disarmament; to control tests; but also let\u2019s have in mind this: when Senator Kennedy suggests that we haven\u2019t been making an effort, he simply doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. It isn\u2019t a question of the number of people who are working in an Administration. It\u2019s a question of who they are. This has been one of the highest level operations in the whole State Department right under the President himself. We have gone certainly the extra mile and then some in making offers to the Soviet Union on control of tests, on disarmament, and in every other way. And I just want to make one thing very clear. Yes, we should make a great effort. But under no circumstances must the United States ever make an agreement based on trust. There must be an absolute guarantee. Now, just a comment on Senator Kennedy\u2019s last answer. He forgets that in this same debate on the Formosa resolution, which he said he voted for \u2013 which he did \u2013 that he voted against an amendment, or was recorded against an amendment \u2013 and on this particular \u2013 or for an amendment, I should say \u2013 which passed the Senate overwhelmingly, seventy to twelve. And that amendment put the Senate of the United States on record with a majority of the Senator\u2019s own party voting for it, as well as the majority of Republicans \u2013 put them on record \u2013 against the very position that the Senator takes now of surrendering, of indicating in advance, that the United States will not defend the offshore islands."}

I served it uh \u2013 in the war. I\u2019m devoted to it. If I lose this election, I will continue in the Senate to try to build a stronger country. But I run because I believe this year the United States has a great opportunity to make a move forward, to make a determination here at home and around the world, that it\u2019s going to reestablish itself as a vigorous society. My judgment is that the Republican party has stood still here in the United States, and it\u2019s also stood still around the world. Uh \u2013 We\u2019re using about fifty percent of our steel capacity today. We had a recession in fifty-eight. We had a recession in fifty-four. We\u2019re not moving ahead in education the way we should. We didn\u2019t make a judgment in fifty-seven and fifty-six and fifty-five and fifty-four that outer space would be important. If we stand still here, if we appoint people to ambassadorships and positions in Washington who have a status quo outlook, who don\u2019t recognize that this is a revolutionary time, then the United States does not maintain its influence. And if we fail, the cause of freedom fails. I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again, to get our economy moving ahead, to set before the American people its goals, its unfinished business. And then throughout the world appoint the best people we can get, ambassadors who can speak the language \u2013 no mere \u2013 not merely people who made a political contribution but who can speak the language. Bring students here; let them see what kind of a country we have. Mr. Nixon said that we should not regard them as pawns in the cold war; we should identify ourselves with them. If that were true, why didn\u2019t we identify ourselves with the people of Africa? Why didn\u2019t we bring students over here? Why did we suddenly offer Congo three hundred students last June when they had the tremendous revolt? That was more than we had offered to all of Africa before from the federal government. I believe that this party \u2013 Republican party \u2013 has stood still really for twenty-five years \u2013 its leadership has. It opposed all of the programs of President Roosevelt and others \u2013 the minimum wage and for housing and economic growth and development of our natural resources, the Tennessee Valley and all the rest. And I believe that if we can get a party which believes in movement, which believes in going ahead, then we can reestablish our position in the world \u2013 strong defense, strong in economic growth, justice for our people, co- guarantee of constitutional rights, so that people will believe that we practice what we preach, and then around the world, particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which existed in Latin America at the time of Franklin Roosevelt. He was a good neighbor in Latin America because he was a good neighbor in the United States; because they saw us as a society that was compassionate, that cared about people, that was moving this country ahead. I believe it my responsibility as the leader of the Democratic party in 1960 to try to warn the American people that in this crucial time we can no longer afford to stand still. We can no longer afford to be second best. I want people all over the world to look to the United States again, to feel that we\u2019re on the move, to feel that our high noon is in the future. I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States, and that they\u2019re going to put this country back to work again. I don\u2019t believe that there is anything this country cannot do. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any burden, or any responsibility, that any American would not assume to protect his country, to protect our security, to advance the cause of freedom. And I believe it incumbent upon us now to do that. Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that that generation of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny. I believe in 1960 and sixty-one and two and three we have a rendezvous with destiny. And I believe it incumbent upon us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom; and to do that, we must give this country leadership and we must get America moving again."}

Our faith informs us in everything we do. My faith informs me about how to take care of the vulnerable, of how to make sure that people have a chance in life. Now, you want to ask basically why I\u2019m pro-life? It\u2019s not simply because of my Catholic faith. That\u2019s a factor, of course. But it\u2019s also because of reason and science. You know, I think about 10 1\/2 years ago, my wife Janna and I went to Mercy Hospital in Janesville where I was born, for our seven week ultrasound for our firstborn child, and we saw that heartbeat. A little baby was in the shape of a bean. And to this day, we have nicknamed our firstborn child Liza, \u201cBean.\u201d Now I believe that life begins at conception. That\u2019s why \u2014 those are the reasons why I\u2019m pro-life. Now I understand this is a difficult issue, and I respect people who don\u2019t agree with me on this, but the policy of a Romney administration will be to oppose abortions with the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. What troubles me more is how this administration has handled all of these issues. Look at what they\u2019re doing through Obamacare with respect to assaulting the religious liberties of this country. They\u2019re infringing upon our first freedom, the freedom of religion, by infringing on Catholic charities, Catholic churches, Catholic hospitals. Our church should not have to sue our federal government to maintain their religious liberties. And with respect to abortion, the Democratic Party used to say they wanted it to be safe, legal and rare. Now they support it without restriction and with taxpayer funding. Taxpayer funding in Obamacare, taxpayer funding with foreign aid. The vice president himself went to China and said that he sympathized and wouldn\u2019t second guess their one child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations. That to me is pretty extreme."}

If it sounds incredible that I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant, that\u2019s because it\u2019s not true. The \u2014 here are the facts. There was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade. The fact is that there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it. And the Illinois Medical Society, the organization of doctors in Illinois, voted against it. Their Hippocratic Oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books. With respect to partial-birth abortion, I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there\u2019s an exception for the mother\u2019s health and life, and this did not contain that exception. And I attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional. And that was rejected, and that\u2019s why I voted present, because I\u2019m willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception. The last point I want to make on the issue of abortion. This is an issue that \u2014 look, it divides us. And in some ways, it may be difficult to \u2014 to reconcile the two views. But there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, \u201cWe should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby.\u201d Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for the first time this year, and I think that\u2019s where we can find some common ground, because nobody\u2019s pro-abortion.

First of all, I cannot tell you how deeply I respect the belief about life and when it begins. I\u2019m a Catholic, raised a Catholic. I was an altar boy. Religion has been a huge part of my life. It helped lead me through a war, leads me today. But I can\u2019t take what is an article of faith for me and legislate it for someone who doesn\u2019t share that article of faith, whether they be agnostic, atheist, Jew, Protestant, whatever. I can\u2019t do that. But I can counsel people. I can talk reasonably about life and about responsibility. I can talk to people, as my wife Teresa does, about making other choices, and about abstinence, and about all these other things that we ought to do as a responsible society. But as a president, I have to represent all the people in the nation. And I have to make that judgment. Now, I believe that you can take that position and not be pro- abortion, but you have to afford people their constitutional rights. And that means being smart about allowing people to be fully educated, to know what their options are in life, and making certain that you don\u2019t deny a poor person the right to be able to have whatever the constitution affords them if they can\u2019t afford it otherwise. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s important. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s important for the United States, for instance, not to have this rigid ideological restriction on helping families around the world to be able to make a smart decision about family planning. You\u2019ll help prevent AIDS. You\u2019ll help prevent unwanted children, unwanted pregnancies.

It is such an assault on the basic promise that America makes that the law will treat individuals as individuals regardless of their status. That is to say their race, their nationality, their gender, sexual orientation, etcetera, etcetera. And the sad fact is that racial profiling occurs in this country. I have a few African-American friends who have gone through this horror and, you know, it makes me want to kind of hit the wall because it\u2019s such an assault on their humanity and their citizenship. We can\u2019t tolerate it anymore. That\u2019s why I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve supported legislation in the first instance in Congress. Because it\u2019s the most we could get done to do hard studies to make the case of the extent to which racial profiling is occurring in our country. But it\u2019s also why I\u2019m so proud that Al Gore said two things. First we would issue, if we\u2019re fortunate enough to be elected, an executive order prohibiting racial profiling. And secondly the first Civil Rights Act legislation we would send to Congress would be a national ban on racial profiling. It is just wrong. It is unAmerican, and to think that in the 21st Century this kind of nonsense is still going on. We have to stop it. The only way to stop it is through the law. The law, after all, is meant to express our values and our aspirations for our society. And our values are violently contradicted by the kind of racial profiling that I know exists. I had a friend a while ago who works in the government, works at the White House, African-American, stopped, surrounded by police for no other cause that anyone can determine than the color of his skin.

I think we ought to raise the age at which juveniles can have a gun. But I also believe strongly that we need to enforce laws on the books that the best way to make sure that we keep our society safe and secure is to hold people accountable for breaking the law. If we catch somebody illegally selling a gun, there needs to be a consequence. If we keep somebody \u2014 you know, illegally using a gun, there needs to be a consequence.

And I think that you pointed the way in your comments, because when you say there are multiple things accomplished by farmers, you\u2019re specifically including conservation and protection of the environment. And yes, farmers are the first environmentalists. And when they decide not to plow a field that is vulnerable to soil erosion, that may cost them a little money, but it helps the environment. I think that we ought to have an expanded conservation reserve program. And I think that the environmental benefits that come from sound management of the land ought to represent a new way for farmers to get some income that will enable them \u2014 enable you to make sensible choices in crop rotation, and when you leave the land fallow and the rest. Now, I\u2019ll go beyond that and say I think we need much more focus on rural economic development programs.

It\u2019s pretty clear that was a quota case, and just because one teacher was white and one black and they had the same qualifications, you know they decided who would stay there. It shouldn\u2019t be that way. Now, the President can say well he wants to mend it, not end it. There are 168 federal programs that allow quotas. He ended one. Now, this economic package, Tim, I\u2019m glad you asked, because you look like the type that might be able to benefit from a 15 percent across- the-board tax cut and $500-per-child tax credit, or \u2014 you know, estate tax relief which you\u2019re not interested in right now, but capital gains rate reduction. If you\u2019re taking care of an elderly parent, you get a $1,000 deduction. We think that\u2019s very important because a lot of people take care of their parents. How do we pay for it? You can have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, which the President opposed and defeated. He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote with him and lost by one vote. We\u2019re going to balance the budget, by the year 2002. The President wants to spend 20 percent more in the next six years, and I want to spend 14 percent more and give that 6 percent back to the people. Remember, it\u2019s your money; it\u2019s not his money. And it\u2019s not my money. It\u2019s your money. And you shouldn\u2019t have to apologize for wanting to keep all you can of it.

It holds that existential threats are often amplified by aggressive defense postures, and thus emphasizes restraint and trust-building with potential adversaries rather than preemptive containment of threats.\n2. **Skepticism toward Alliances and Nationalistic Autonomy**: Opposing strong global alliances, this ideology champions national autonomy and a more insular foreign policy, viewing alliances and multinational agreements as limiting a nation\u2019s independence. It promotes a hands-off approach that encourages nations to manage their own security, discouraging interventionist alliances that might escalate conflicts or obligate countries to unnecessary foreign entanglements.\n3. **Cultural Relativism and Non-Intervention in Internal Conflicts**: Instead of a moral duty to intervene, this view supports the idea that nations should respect cultural differences and avoid intervening in what are seen as internal conflicts of other countries. This perspective argues against imposing moral imperatives on other nations, suggesting that each culture or government should handle its internal affairs without external pressures or moral judgments.\n4. **Diplomacy over Military Posturing**: This ideology de-emphasizes the use of military threats as a tool for maintaining credibility, favoring soft power and diplomacy to avoid provocation. It views reliance on military deterrence as an outdated, destabilizing practice that can encourage adversaries to escalate. Instead, peaceful negotiation and collaboration are seen as the pathways to resolving differences and preventing conflicts.\n5. **Reactive, Non-Interventionist Security Measures**: Contrary to preemptive action, this stance emphasizes a reactive approach, engaging in conflict only when directly threatened. It rejects the notion of addressing threats proactively, instead advocating for minimal foreign involvement and military restraint, arguing that such policies are more sustainable and prevent unnecessary entanglements.\n6. **Respect for Sovereignty over Democratic Evangelism**: Rather than promoting democracy as a universal value, this view supports political and cultural diversity on the global stage. It respects each nation\u2019s choice of government structure and rejects interventions aimed at spreading democratic systems, viewing this as a form of cultural imposition that can create instability and resentment.\n7. **Static Threat Landscape and Limited Adaptation**: This perspective is skeptical of the idea that global threats are constantly evolving, suggesting that perceived threats are often exaggerated to justify unnecessary military spending or intervention. It advocates for a more restrained, predictable approach to foreign policy, with a focus on internal stability and addressing domestic needs over responding to global shifts.\nIn sum, this opposite ideological framework centers around **non-interventionism, national autonomy, diplomatic restraint, and cultural respect**.

Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust. Let\u2019s just make that very clear. What I have proposed for a long time, and I\u2019ve had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, let\u2019s be clear and let\u2019s have some straight talk. The Russians are preventing significant action in the United Nations Security Council. I have proposed a league of democracies, a group of people \u2013 a group of countries that share common interests, common values, common ideals, they also control a lot of the world\u2019s economic power. We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect. The Iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues. So I am convinced that together, we can, with the French, with the British, with the Germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect Iranian behavior. But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight. And it is a threat not only in this region but around the world. What I\u2019d also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans, there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran. There is the Republican Guard in Iran, which Senator Kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror. Senator Obama said that would be provocative. So this is a serious threat. This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons."}

Now, let\u2019s take a look at where we\u2019ve gone \u2014 come from. When Barack Obama was elected, they had enough fissile material \u2014 nuclear material to make one bomb. Now they have enough for five. They\u2019re racing toward a nuclear weapon. They\u2019re four years closer toward a nuclear weapons capability. We\u2019ve had four different sanctions, the U.N. on Iran, three from the Bush administration, one here. And the only reason we got it is because Russia watered it down and prevented the \u2014 the sanctions from hitting the central bank. Mitt Romney proposed these sanctions in 2007. In Congress, I\u2019ve been fighting for these sanctions since 2009. The administration was blocking us every step of the way. Only because we had strong bipartisan support for these tough sanctions were we able to overrule their objections and put them in spite of the administration. Imagine what would have happened if we had these sanctions in place earlier. You think Iran\u2019s not brazen? Look at what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019re stepping up their terrorist attacks. They tried a terrorist attack in the United States last year when they tried to blow up the Saudi ambassador at a restaurant in Washington, D.C. And talk about credibility? When this administration says that all options are on the table, they send out senior administration officials that send all these mixed signals. And so, in order to solve this peacefully \u2014 which is everybody\u2019s goal \u2014 you have to have the ayatollahs change their minds. Look at where they are. They\u2019re moving faster toward a nuclear weapon. It\u2019s because this administration has no credibility on this issue. It\u2019s because this administration watered down sanctions, delayed sanctions, tried to stop us for putting the tough sanctions in place. Now we have them in place because of Congress. They say the military option\u2019s on the table, but it\u2019s not being viewed as credible. And the key is to do this peacefully, is to make sure that we have credibility.

And obviously we hope that diplomacy works before you ever use force. The hardest decision a president makes is ever to use force. After 9\/11, we had to look at the world differently. After 9\/11, we had to recognize that when we saw a threat, we must take it seriously before it comes to hurt us. In the old days we\u2019d see a threat, and we could deal with it if we felt like it or not. But 9\/11 changed it all. I vowed to our countrymen that I would do everything I could to protect the American people. That\u2019s why we\u2019re bringing Al Qaida to justice. Seventy five percent of them have been brought to justice. That\u2019s why I said to Afghanistan: If you harbor a terrorist, you\u2019re just as guilty as the terrorist. And the Taliban is no longer in power, and Al Qaida no longer has a place to plan. And I saw a unique threat in Saddam Hussein, as did my opponent, because we thought he had weapons of mass destruction. And the unique threat was that he could give weapons of mass destruction to an organization like Al Qaida, and the harm they inflicted on us with airplanes would be multiplied greatly by weapons of mass destruction. And that was the serious, serious threat. So I tried diplomacy, went to the United Nations. But as we learned in the same report I quoted, Saddam Hussein was gaming the oil-for-food program to get rid of sanctions. He was trying to get rid of sanctions for a reason: He wanted to restart his weapons programs. We all thought there was weapons there, Robin. My opponent thought there was weapons there. That\u2019s why he called him a grave threat. I wasn\u2019t happy when we found out there wasn\u2019t weapons, and we\u2019ve got an intelligence group together to figure out why. But Saddam Hussein was a unique threat. And the world is better off without him in power. And my opponent\u2019s plans lead me to conclude that Saddam Hussein would still be in power, and the world would be more dangerous. Thank you, sir."}

Nuclear proliferation. There\u2019s some 600-plus tons of unsecured material still in the former Soviet Union and Russia. At the rate that the president is currently securing it, it\u2019ll take 13 years to get it. I did a lot of work on this. I wrote a book about it several years ago \u2014 six, seven years ago \u2014 called \u201cThe New War,\u201d which saw the difficulties of this international criminal network. And back then, we intercepted a suitcase in a Middle Eastern country with nuclear materials in it. And the black market sale price was about $250 million. Now, there are terrorists trying to get their hands on that stuff today. And this president, I regret to say, has secured less nuclear material in the last two years since 9\/11 than we did in the two years preceding 9\/11. We have to do this job. And to do the job, you can\u2019t cut the money for it. The president actually cut the money for it. You have to put the money into it and the funding and the leadership. And part of that leadership is sending the right message to places like North Korea. Right now the president is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunker-busting nuclear weapons. The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons. It doesn\u2019t make sense. You talk about mixed messages. We\u2019re telling other people, \u201cYou can\u2019t have nuclear weapons,\u201d but we\u2019re pursuing a new nuclear weapon that we might even contemplate using. Not this president.

At one of the recent economic summit conferences between myself and the other leaders of the western world, we committed ourselves to take strong action against terrorism. Airplane hijacking was one of the elements of that commitment. There is no doubt that we have seen in recent years \u2013 in recent months \u2013 additional acts of violence against Jews in France and, of course, against those who live in Israel, by the PLO and other terrorist organizations. Ultimately, the most serious terrorist threat is if one of those radical nations, who believe in terrorism as a policy, should have atomic weapons. Both I and all my predecessors have had a deep commitment to controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons. In countries like Libya or Iraq, we have even alienated some of our closest trade partners because we have insisted upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries. When Governor Reagan has been asked about that, he makes the very disturbing comment that non-proliferation, or the control of the spread of nuclear weapons, is none of our business. And recently when he was asked specifically about Iraq, he said there is nothing we can do about it. This ultimate terrorist threat is the most fearsome of all, and it\u2019s part of a pattern where our country must stand firm to control terrorism of all kinds."}

And if Israel is attacked, we have their back, not just diplomatically, not just culturally, but militarily. That\u2019s number one. Number two, with regards to Iran and the threat of Iran, there\u2019s no question but that a nuclear Iran, a nuclear-capable Iran is unacceptable to America. It presents a threat not only to our friends but ultimately a threat to us to have Iran have nuclear material, nuclear weapons that could be used against us or used to be threatening to us. It is also essential for us to understand what our mission is in Iran, and that is to dissuade Iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means. And crippling sanctions are something I called for five years ago, when I was in Israel, speaking at the Herzliya Conference. I laid out seven steps, crippling sanctions were number one. And they do work. You\u2019re seeing it right now in the economy. It\u2019s absolutely the right thing to do, to have crippling sanctions. I would have put them in place earlier. But it\u2019s good that we have them. Number two, something I would add today is I would tighten those sanctions. I would say that ships that carry Iranian oil, can\u2019t come into our ports. I imagine the E.U. would agree with us as well. Not only ships couldn\u2019t, but I\u2019d say companies that are moving their oil can\u2019t, people who are trading in their oil can\u2019t. I would tighten those sanctions further. Secondly, I\u2019d take on diplomatic isolation efforts. I\u2019d make sure that Ahmadinejad is indicted under the Genocide Convention. His words amount to genocide incitation. I would indict him for it. I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world. The same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of South Africa. We need to increase pressure time, and time again on Iran because anything other than a \u2014 a \u2014 a solution to this, which says \u2014 which stops this \u2014 this nuclear folly of theirs, is unacceptable to America. And of course, a military action is the last resort. It is something one would only \u2013 only consider if all of the other avenues had been \u2014 had been tried to their full extent."}

And that\u2019s why proliferation is one of the centerpieces of a multi-prong strategy to make the country safer. My administration started what\u2019s called the Proliferation Security Initiative. Over 60 nations involved with disrupting the trans-shipment of information and\/or weapons of mass destruction materials. And we\u2019ve been effective. We busted the A.Q. Khan network. This was a proliferator out of Pakistan that was selling secrets to places like North Korea and Libya. We convinced Libya to disarm. It\u2019s a central part of dealing with weapons of mass destruction and proliferation. I\u2019ll tell you another way to help protect America in the long run is to continue with missile defenses. And we\u2019ve got a robust research and development program that has been ongoing during my administration. We\u2019ll be implementing a missile-defense system relatively quickly. And that is another way to help deal with the threats that we face in the 21st century. My opponent opposed the missile defenses."}

Look at where we are today. The United States is still the indispensable nation in the aftermath of the Cold War and on the brink of the 21st Century. I have worked to support our country as the world\u2019s strongest force for peace and freedom, prosperity and security. We have done the following things - Number one, we\u2019ve managed the aftermath of the Cold War, supporting a big drop in nuclear weapons in Russia. The removal of Russian troops from the Baltics. The integration of Central and Eastern European democracies into a new partnership with NATO. And, I might add, with the democratic Russia. There are no nuclear missiles pointed at the children of the United States tonight and have not been in our administration for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age. We have worked hard for peace and freedom. When I took office, Haiti was governed by a dictator that had defied the United States. When I took office, the worst war in Europe was waging in Bosnia. Now there is a the democratically elected president in Haiti. Peace in Bosnia. We just had the election there. We\u2019ve made progress in Northern Ireland, in the Middle East. We\u2019ve also stood up to the new threats of terrorism. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, and we have worked hard to expand America\u2019s economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade with the largest new number of trade agreements in history And that\u2019s one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again."}

My message to the troops is also - Thank you for what they\u2019re doing, but it\u2019s also help is on the way. I believe those troops deserve better than what they are getting today. You know, it\u2019s interesting. When I was in a rope line just the other day, coming out here from Wisconsin, a couple of young returnees were in the line, one active duty, one from the Guard. And they both looked at me and said: We need you. You\u2019ve got to help us over there. Now I believe there\u2019s a better way to do this. You know, the president\u2019s father did not go into Iraq, into Baghdad, beyond Basra. And the reason he didn\u2019t is, he said \u2014 he wrote in his book \u2014 because there was no viable exit strategy. And he said our troops would be occupiers in a bitterly hostile land. That\u2019s exactly where we find ourselves today. There\u2019s a sense of American occupation. The only building that was guarded when the troops when into Baghdad was the oil ministry. We didn\u2019t guard the nuclear facilities. We didn\u2019t guard the foreign office, where you might have found information about weapons of mass destruction. We didn\u2019t guard the borders. Almost every step of the way, our troops have been left on these extraordinarily difficult missions. I know what it\u2019s like to go out on one of those missions when you don\u2019t know what\u2019s around the corner. And I believe our troops need other allies helping.

And, Gwen, at the time, I was talking specifically about this question of unilateral sanctions. What happens when we impose unilateral sanctions is, unless there\u2019s a collective effort, then other people move in and take advantage of the situation and you don\u2019t have any impact, except to penalize American companies. We\u2019ve got sanctions on Iran now. We may well want to go to the U.N. Security Council and ask for even tougher sanctions if they don\u2019t live up to their obligations under the initial \u2014 International Atomic Energy Agency Non-Proliferation Treaty. We dealt with Iran differently than we have Iraq partly because Iran has not yet, as Iraq did, violated 12 years of resolutions by the U.N. Security Council. We\u2019re working with the Brits and the Germans and the French, who\u2019ve been negotiating with the Iranians. We recently were actively involved in a meeting with the board of governors in the International Atomic Energy Agency. And as I say, there will be a follow-up meeting in November to determine whether or not Iran\u2019s living up to their commitments and obligations. And if they aren\u2019t, my guess is then the board of governors will recommend sending the whole matter to the U.N. Security Council for the application of the international sanctions, which I think would be exactly the right way to go. We\u2019re addressing North Korea on a similar basis, working with the Chinese, the South Koreans, the Japanese and others to try to bring them around. One of the great by-products, for example, of what we did in Iraq and Afghanistan is that five days after we captured Saddam Hussein, Moammar Gadhafi in Libya came forward and announced that he was going to surrender all of his nuclear materials to the United States, which he has done. This was one of the biggest sources of proliferation in the world today in terms of the threat that was represented by that. The suppliers network that provided that, headed by Mr. A.Q. Khan, has been shut down. We\u2019ve made major progress in dealing here with a major issue with respect to nuclear proliferation. And we\u2019ll continue to press very hard on the North Koreans and the Iranians as well."}

But you\u2019re absolutely correct, it is a threat, it\u2019s a huge threat. And what\u2019s interesting is, it\u2019s a threat that has grown while the president has been preoccupied with Iraq, where there wasn\u2019t a threat. If he\u2019d let the inspectors do their job and go on, we wouldn\u2019t have 10 times the numbers of forces in Iraq that we have in Afghanistan chasing Osama bin Laden. Meanwhile, while Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons, some 37 tons of what they called yellow cake, the stuff they use to make enriched uranium, while they\u2019re doing that, North Korea has moved from one bomb maybe, maybe, to four to seven bombs. For two years, the president didn\u2019t even engage with North Korea, did nothing at all, while it was growing more dangerous, despite the warnings of former Secretary of Defense William Perry, who negotiated getting television cameras and inspectors into that reactor. We were safer before President Bush came to office. Now they have the bombs and we\u2019re less safe. So what do we do? We\u2019ve got to join with the British and the French, with the Germans, who\u2019ve been involved, in their initiative. We\u2019ve got to lead the world now to crack down on proliferation as a whole. But the president\u2019s been slow to do that, even in Russia. At his pace, it\u2019s going to take 13 years to reduce and get ahold of all the loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union. I\u2019ve proposed a plan that can capture it and contain it and clean it within four years. And the president is moving to the creation of our own bunker- busting nuclear weapon. It\u2019s very hard to get other countries to give up their weapons when you\u2019re busy developing a new one. I\u2019m going to lead the world in the greatest counterproliferation effort.

Since this campaign began I have had a very rare privilege. I have traveled to forty-eight of the fifty states and in my travels I have learned what the people of the United States are thinking about. There is one issue that stands out above all the rest, one in which every American is concerned, regardless of what group he may be a member and regardless of where he may live. And that issue, very simply stated, is this: how can we keep the peace \u2013 keep it without surrender? How can we extend freedom \u2013 extend it without war? Now in determining how we deal with this issue, we must find the answer to a very important but simple question: who threatens the peace? Who threatens freedom in the world? There is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom \u2013 that that is presented by the international Communist movement. And therefore if we are to have peace, we must know how to deal with the Communists and their leaders. I know Mr. Khrushchev. I also have had the opportunity of knowing and meeting other Communist leaders in the world. I believe there are certain principles we must find in dealing with him and his colleagues \u2013 principles, if followed, that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom. First, we have to learn from the past, because we cannot afford to make the mistakes of the past. In the seven years before this Administration came into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain. And at the end of that seven years we were engaged in a war in Korea which cost of thirty thousand American lives. In the past seven years, in President Eisenhower\u2019s Administration, this situation has been reversed. We ended the Korean War; by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars; and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table. Now why were we successful, as our predecessors were not successful? I think there\u2019re several reasons. In the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the Communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world. One of the major errors they made was the one that led to the Korean War. In ruling out the defense of Korea, they invited aggression in that area. They thought they were going to have peace \u2013 it brought war. We learned from their mistakes. And so, in our seven years, we find that we have been firm in our diplomacy; we have never made concessions without getting concessions in return. We have always been willing to go the extra mile to negotiate for disarmament or in any other area. But we have never been willing to do anything that, in effect, surrendered freedom any place in the world. That is why President Eisenhower was correct in not apologizing or expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev at the Paris Conference, as Senator Kennedy suggested he could have done. That is why Senator wh- President Eisenhower was also correct in his policy in the Formosa Straits, where he declined, and refused to follow the recommendations \u2013 recommendations which Senator Kennedy voted for in 1955; again made in 1959; again repeated in his debates that you have heard \u2013 recommendations with regard to \u2013 again \u2013 slicing off a piece of free territory, and abandoning it, if \u2013 in effect, to the Communists. Why did the President feel this was wrong and why was the President right and his critics wrong? Because again this showed a lack of understanding of dictators, a lack of understanding particularly of Communists, because every time you make such a concession it does not lead to peace; it only encourages them to blackmail you. It encourages them to begin a war. And so I say that the record shows that we know how to keep the peace, to keep it without surrender. Let us move now to the future. It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical\u2026 leaders that the world has ever seen. That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area. First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have \u2013 if the should launch a surprise attack \u2013 we will be able to destroy their war-making capability. They must know, in other words, that it is national suicide if they begin anything. We need this kind of strength because we\u2019re the guardians of the peace. In addition to military strength, we need to see that the economy of this country continues to grow. It has grown in the past seven years. It can and will grow even more in the next four. And the reason that it must grow even more is because we have things to do at home and also because we\u2019re in a race for survival \u2013 a race in which it isn\u2019t enough to be ahead; it isn\u2019t enough simply to be complacent. We have to move ahead in order to stay ahead. And that is why, in this field, I have made recommendations which I am confident will move the American economy ahead \u2013 move it firmly and soundly so that there will never be a time when the Soviet Union will be able to challenge our superiority in this field. And so we need military strength, we need economic strength, we also need the right diplomatic policies. What are they? Again we turn to the past. Firmness but no belligerence, and by no belligerence I mean that we do not answer insult by insult. When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues. And that example that President Eisenhower has set we will continue to follow. But all this by itself is not enough. It is not enough for us simply to be the strongest nation militarily, the strongest economically, and also to have firm diplomacy. We must have a great goal. And that is: not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world, to extend it to all the world because that is America\u2019s destiny. To extend it to all the world because the Communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend Communism. And you cannot fight a victory for Communism or a strategy of victory for Communism with the strategy, simply of holding the line. And so I say that we believe that our policies of military strength, of economic strength, of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep it without surrender. We also believe that in the great field of ideals that we can lead America to the victory for freedom \u2013 victory in the newly developing countries, victory also in the captive countries \u2013 provided we have faith in ourselves and faith in our principles."}

We cannot allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon. It would be a game-changer in the region. Not only would it threaten Israel, our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world, but it would also create a possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists. And so it\u2019s unacceptable. And I will do everything that\u2019s required to prevent it. And we will never take military options off the table. And it is important that we don\u2019t provide veto power to the United Nations or anyone else in acting in our interests. It is important, though, for us to use all the tools at our disposal to prevent the scenario where we\u2019ve got to make those kinds of choices. And that\u2019s why I have consistently said that, if we can work more effectively with other countries diplomatically to tighten sanctions on Iran, if we can reduce our energy consumption through alternative energy, so that Iran has less money, if we can impose the kinds of sanctions that, say, for example, Iran right now imports gasoline, even though it\u2019s an oil-producer, because its oil infrastructure has broken down, if we can prevent them from importing the gasoline that they need and the refined petroleum products, that starts changing their cost-benefit analysis. That starts putting the squeeze on them. Now, it is true, though, that I believe that we should have direct talks \u2014 not just with our friends, but also with our enemies \u2014 to deliver a tough, direct message to Iran that, if you don\u2019t change your behavior, then there will be dire consequences. If you do change your behavior, then it is possible for you to re-join the community of nations. Now, it may not work. But one of the things we\u2019ve learned is, is that when we take that approach, whether it\u2019s in North Korea or in Iran, then we have a better chance at better outcomes. When President Bush decided we\u2019re not going to talk to Iran, we\u2019re not going to talk to North Korea, you know what happened? Iran went from zero centrifuges to develop nuclear weapons to 4,000. North Korea quadrupled its nuclear capability. We\u2019ve got to try to have talks, understanding that we\u2019re not taking military options off the table."}

It\u2019s a nation that\u2019s not like \u2014 like others and it does not have a civilian leadership that is calling the shots there. You have the ISI, their intelligence organization, is probably the most powerful of the \u2014 of three branches there. Then you have the military and then you have the civilian government. This is a nation, which, if it falls apart, if it \u2014 if it becomes a failed state, there are nuclear weapons there and you\u2019ve got \u2014 you\u2019ve got terrorists there who could grab their \u2014 their hands onto those nuclear weapons. This is \u2014 this is an important part of the world for us. Pakistan is \u2014 is technically an ally, and they\u2019re not acting very much like an ally right now. But we have some work to do. And I \u2014 I don\u2019t blame the administration for the fact that the relationship with Pakistan is strained. We \u2014 we had to go into Pakistan. We had to go in there to get Osama bin Laden. That was the right thing to do. And \u2014 and that upset them, but obviously there was a great deal of anger even before that. But we\u2019re going to have to work with the \u2014 with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that they\u2019re on. And it\u2019s important for them. It\u2019s important for the nuclear weapons. It\u2019s important for the success of Afghanistan. Because inside Pakistan, you have a \u2014 a large group of Pashtun that are \u2014 that are Taliban. They\u2019re going to come rushing back in to Afghanistan when we go. And that\u2019s one of the reasons the Afghan Security Forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that.

The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because an Iranian nuclear weapons program has been stopped. The terrorist threat to United States troops has been decreased in some ways because there\u2019s not 175,000 in a dangerous part of the world. There\u2019s only 15,000. But there are other parts of the world that are challenging. Let me tell you this - To beat terrorism, there\u2019s only one candidate who can do it, and it\u2019s Hillary Clinton. Remember, Hillary Clinton was the senator from New York on 9\/11. She was there at the World Trade Center when they were still searching for victims and survivors. That\u2019s seared onto her, the need to beat terrorism. And she\u2019s got a plan to do it. She was part of the national security team that wiped out bin Laden. Here\u2019s her plan to defeat ISIL. First, we\u2019ve got to keep taking out their leaders on the battlefield. She was part of the team that got bin Laden, and she\u2019ll lead the team that will get Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS. Second, we\u2019ve got to disrupt financing networks, third, disrupt their ability to recruit on the Internet, in their safe havens. But, fourth, we also have to work with allies to share and surge intelligence. That\u2019s the Hillary Clinton plan; she\u2019s got the experience to do it. Donald Trump. Donald Trump can\u2019t start a Twitter war with Miss Universe without shooting himself in the foot. Donald Trump doesn\u2019t have a plan.

First of all, when we and our allies \u2014 the Italians, the French, and the United Kingdom \u2014 went into Lebanon, we went in there at the request of what was left of the Lebanese Government to be a stabilizing force while they tried to establish a government. But the first \u2014 pardon me \u2014 the first time we went in, we went in at their request because the war was going on right in Beirut between Israel and the PLO terrorists. Israel could not be blamed for that. Those terrorists had been violating their northern border consistently, and Israel chased them all the way to there. Then we went in with the multinational force to help remove, and did remove, more than 13,000 of those terrorists from Lebanon. We departed. And then the Government of Lebanon asked us back in as a stabilizing force while they established a government and sought to get the foreign forces all the way out of Lebanon and that they could then take care of their own borders. And we were succeeding. We were there for the better part of a year. Our position happened to be at the airport. Oh, there were occasional snipings and sometimes some artillery fire, but we did not engage in conflict that was out of line with our mission. I will never send troops anywhere on a mission of that kind without telling them that if somebody shoots at them, they can darn well shoot back. And this is what we did. We never initiated any kind of action; we defended ourselves there. But we were succeeding to the point that the Lebanese Government had been organized \u2014 if you will remember, there were the meetings in Geneva in which they began to meet with the hostile factional forces and try to put together some kind of a peace plan. We were succeeding, and that was why the terrorist acts began. There are forces there \u2014 and that includes Syria, in my mind \u2014 who don\u2019t want us to succeed, who don\u2019t want that kind of a peace with a dominant Lebanon, dominant over its own territory. And so, the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing of the building. Then the multilateral force withdrew for only one reason: We withdrew because we were no longer able to carry out the mission for which we had been sent in. But we went in in the interest of peace and to keep Israel and Syria from getting into the sixth war between them. And I have no apologies for our going on a peace mission."}

I\u2019ve been a person who has to set a clear vision and convince people to follow. I\u2019ve got a strategy for the Middle East. And first let me say that our nation now needs to speak with one voice during this time, and I applaud the president for working hard to diffuse tensions. Our nation needs to be credible and strong. When we say we\u2019re somebody\u2019s friend, everybody has got to believe it. Israel is our friend and we\u2019ll stand by Israel. We need to reach out to moderate Arab nations as well to build coalitions to keep the peace. I also need \u2014 the next leader needs to be patient. We can\u2019t put the Middle East peace process on our timetable. It\u2019s got to be on the timetable of the people that we\u2019re trying to bring to the peace table. We can\u2019t dictate the terms of peace, which means that you have to be steady. You can\u2019t worry about polls or focus groups. You\u2019ve got to have a clear vision. That\u2019s what a leader does. A leader also understands that the United States must be strong to keep the peace. Saddam Hussein still is a threat in the Middle East. Our coalition against Saddam is unraveling. Sanctions are loosened. The man who may be developing weapons of mass destruction, we don\u2019t know because inspectors aren\u2019t in. So to answer your question, it requires a clear vision, a willingness to stand by our friends, and the credibility for people both friend and foe to understand when America says something, we mean it."}

Obviously, we\u2019ve poured billions of dollars into airport security. We have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go. We\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re hardening our chemical sites. We haven\u2019t done enough in terms of transit; we haven\u2019t done enough in terms of ports. And the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies. It\u2019s in a suitcase. This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important. It is the \u2014 the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons. And we \u2014 we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense. And I actually believe that we need missile defense, because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but I also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then we\u2019re making a mistake. The other thing that we have to focus on, though, is Al Qaida. They are now operating in 60 countries. We can\u2019t simply be focused on Iraq. We have to go to the root cause, and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan. That\u2019s going to be critical. We are going to need more cooperation with our allies. And one last point I want to make. It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism. And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore America\u2019s standing in the world. We are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago. And this is the greatest country on Earth. But because of some of the mistakes that have been made \u2014 and I give Senator McCain great credit on the torture issue, for having identified that as something that undermines our long-term security \u2014 because of those things, we, I think, are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that America is that shining beacon on a hill."}

I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization. I\u2019ve consistently said so. What Senator McCain refers to is a measure in the Senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of Iraq. To deal with Iran. And ironically, the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq. Iraq was Iran\u2019s mortal enemy. That was cleared away. And what we\u2019ve seen over the last several years is Iran\u2019s influence grow. They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon. So obviously, our policy over the last eight years has not worked. Senator McCain is absolutely right, we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran. It would be a game changer. Not only would it threaten Israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this Middle East. Now here\u2019s what we need to do. We do need tougher sanctions. I do not agree with Senator McCain that we\u2019re going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with countries like Russia and China that are, I think Senator McCain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesn\u2019t have a nuclear weapon. But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked. It has not worked in Iran, it has not worked in North Korea. In each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons. That will change when I\u2019m president of the United States."}

First of all, let\u2019s talk about this troop funding issue because John always brings this up. Senator McCain cut \u2014 Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn\u2019t believe in a timetable. I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush. We had a difference on the timetable. We didn\u2019t have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops. We had a legitimate difference, and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy. And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there. The question is, was this wise? We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate. We need more troops there. We need more resources there. Senator McCain, in the rush to go into Iraq, said, you know what? We\u2019ve been successful in Afghanistan. There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there. This is a time when bin Laden was still out, and now they\u2019ve reconstituted themselves. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in Afghanistan and it needs to end there. But we can\u2019t do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country. Now, what I\u2019ve said is we should end this war responsibly. We should do it in phases. But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put \u2014 provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda. And right now, the commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have acknowledged that we don\u2019t have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge."}

During their, that, in three and a half years, three separate leaders. The Soviets have not been willing to talk. We are the ones that went to the table in INF. We had a good proposal, a moral proposal. Ban an entire generation of intermediate nuclear force weapons and if you won\u2019t do that, don\u2019t leave your allies in Europe in a monopoly position. The Soviets with 1,200 of these things, and the alliance with none. We didn\u2019t think that\u2019s the way to deter aggression and keep the peace. The president went, the first thing he did when he came into office was make a proposal on the most destabilizing weapons of all, START. And when the the strategic weapon and when the Soviets said, well, we don\u2019t like that proposal, we said all right, we\u2019ll be more flexible. I at the urging of the president went to Geneva and laid on the table a treaty to ban all chemical weapons. We don\u2019t want them to have a monopoly. We said look, let\u2019s come together. You come over here and see what we\u2019re doing; we\u2019ll go over there and see what you\u2019re doing. But let\u2019s save the kids of this world from chemical weapons.

In the mutual balance force reduction to reduce conventional forces, they\u2019re not even willing to tell us the base. Mrs. Ferraro knows that, and how many troops they have. There\u2019s four sessions. We have had an agreement with them on the hot line.

I\u2019ll give you one, that HMET, that heavy truck, that\u2019s cost what is it $850 million and the Pentagon didn\u2019t request it and, yet, a member of Congress, a very powerful one, put it in the budget.

My Secretary of Defense is going to have to make a very difficult decision in which system to go forward with. But we are protecting both of them. We are moving forward with negotiations and, you see, I just think it would be dumb negotiating policy with the Soviets to cut out one or the other of the two options right now. The Soviets are modernizing. They continue to modernize and we can\u2019t simply we\u2019ve got enough nuclear weapons, let\u2019s freeze. We can\u2019t do that.

And, so, that\u2019s the way I\u2019d reply to it and I believe we can have the strongest and best defense possible if we modernize, if we go forward with competitive strategies and if we do follow through on the Packard Commission report."}

We\u2019ll have to see if that happens. The thing about Iraq, of course, was at the end of the war we had pretty well decimated their military. We had put them back in the box, so to speak. We had a strong international coalition raid against them, effective economic sanctions, and a very robust inspection regime was in place under the U.N. auspices and it was able to do a good job of stripping out the capacity to build weapons of mass destruction, the work he had been doing that had not been destroyed during the war in biological and chemical agents, as well as a nuclear program. Unfortunately now we find ourselves in a situation where that started to fray on us, where the coalition now no longer is tied tightly together. Recently the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, two Gulf States, have reopened diplomatic relations with Baghdad. The Russians and French are flying commercial airliners back into Baghdad and thumbing their nose at the international sanctions regime, and of course U.N. inspectors have been kicked out and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been absolutely no response. . We\u2019re in a situation today where our posture with Iraq is weaker than it was at the end of the war. It\u2019s unfortunate. I also think it\u2019s unfortunate we find ourselves in a position where we don\u2019t know for sure what might be transpiring inside Iraq. I certainly hope he\u2019s not regenerating that kind of capability, but if he were, if in fact Saddam Hussein were taking steps to try to rebuild nuclear capability or weapons of mass destruction, you would have to give very serious consideration to military action to \u2014 to stop that activity. I don\u2019t think you can afford to have a man like Saddam Hussein with nuclear weapons in the Middle East."}

They want to know that they have good judgment. And they want to know that you\u2019ll tell them the truth. John Kerry and I will tell the American people the truth. During the time that I have served on the Intelligence Committee in the Senate, traveling to some of the places we\u2019ve talked about tonight \u2014 Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Middle East, Turkey \u2014 meeting with the leaders of NATO, I have a very clear idea of what has to be done to keep this country safe. The threats we face - terrorism, killing terrorists and stopping them before they can do damage to us, making sure that we stop the spread of nuclear weapons. I agree with John Kerry from Thursday night, that the danger of nuclear weapons getting in the hands of terrorists is one of the greatest threats that America faces. But the one thing that we know from this administration is \u2014 and I \u2014 first of all, I don\u2019t claim to have the long political resume that Vice President Cheney has. That\u2019s just the truth, and the American people know that and deserve to know it. But what we know from this administration is that a long resume does not equal good judgment. Here are the judgments I would make - My first priority would be to keep this country safe. I would find terrorists where they are and stop them and kill them before they do harm to us. We would stop the spread of nuclear weapons. And we would also strengthen this military, which means providing the equipment and training that they need. We want to raise the active-duty forces by 40,000, double the special forces so we can find terrorists where they are, and provide the kind of support for families \u2014 health care, housing \u2014 that they deserve while their loved ones are serving and protecting us.

What we know is that the president and the vice president have not done the work to build the coalition that we need \u2014 dramatically different than the first Gulf War. We know that they haven\u2019t done it, and we know they can\u2019t do it. They didn\u2019t, by the way, just reject the allies going into lead- up to the war. They also rejected them in the effort to do the reconstruction in Iraq, and that has consequences. What we believe is, as part of our entire plan for Iraq \u2014 and we have a plan for Iraq. They have a plan for Iraq too - more of the same. We have a plan for success. And that plan includes speeding up the training of the military. We have less than half of the staff that we need there to complete that training. Second, make sure that the reconstruction is sped up in a way that the Iraqis see some tangible benefit for what\u2019s happening. And by the way, if we need to, we can take Iraqis out of Iraq to train them. It is not secure enough. It\u2019s so dangerous on the ground that they can\u2019t be trained there. We can take them out of Iraq for purposes of training. We should do whatever has to be done to train the Iraqis and to speed up that process. That works in conjunction with making sure the elections take place on time. Right now, the United Nations, which is responsible for the elections in January, has about 35 people there. Now, that\u2019s compared with a much smaller country like East Timor, where they had over 200 people on the ground. You need more than 35 people to hold an election in Cleveland, much less in Iraq. And they keep saying the election\u2019s on schedule, this is going to happen. The reality is we need a new president with credibility with the rest of the world and who has a real plan for success. Success breeds contribution, breeds joining the coalition. Not only that, I want to go back to what the vice president said. He attacks us about the troops. They sent 40,000 American troops into Iraq without the body armor they needed. They sent them without the armored vehicles they needed. While they were on the ground fighting, they lobbied the Congress to cut their combat pay. This is the height of hypocrisy."}

It\u2019s a very important event, and they\u2019ve done a superb job of putting it together. It\u2019s important to look at all of our developments in Iraq within the broader context of the global war on terror. And, after 9\/11, it became clear that we had to do several things to have a successful strategy to win the global war on terror, specifically that we had to go after the terrorists wherever we might find them, that we also had to go after state sponsors of terror, those who might provide sanctuary or safe harbor for terror. And we also then finally had to stand up democracies in their stead afterwards, because that was the only way to guarantee that these states would not again become safe harbors for terror or for the development of deadly weapons. Concern about Iraq specifically focused on the fact that Saddam Hussein had been, for years, listed on the state sponsor of terror, that they he had established relationships with Abu Nidal, who operated out of Baghdad; he paid $25,000 to the families of suicide bombers; and he had an established relationship with Al Qaida. Specifically, look at George Tenet, the CIA director\u2019s testimony before the Committee on Foreign Relations two years ago when he talked about a 10-year relationship. The effort that we\u2019ve mounted with respect to Iraq focused specifically on the possibility that this was the most likely nexus between the terrorists and weapons of mass destruction. The biggest threat we faced today is the possibility of terrorists smuggling a nuclear weapon or a biological agent into one of our own cities and threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans. What we did in Iraq was exactly the right thing to do. If I had it to recommend all over again, I would recommend exactly the same course of action. The world is far safer today because Saddam Hussein is in jail, his government is no longer in power. And we did exactly the right thing."}

I\u2019ve been saying that for over a year now. And I think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because it\u2019s been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better. We had the highest fatalities among U.S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002. And we are seeing a major offensive taking place \u2014 Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion. They are feeling emboldened. And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we don\u2019t have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan. So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan. Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9\/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no Al Qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan. And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front \u2014 that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan. So here\u2019s what we have to do comprehensively, though. It\u2019s not just more troops. We have to press the Afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people. And I\u2019ve said this to President Karzai. Number two, we\u2019ve got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years. Number three, we\u2019ve got to deal with Pakistan, because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, we\u2019ve been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens.

They are not true. But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been in place. Because they have the opportunity to reenter the community of nations, and we would welcome that. There \u2014 there are people in Iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world for a better life. And we hope that their leadership takes the right decision, but the deal we\u2019ll accept is they end their nuclear program. It\u2019s very straightforward. And I\u2019m glad that Governor Romney agrees with the steps that we\u2019re taking. You know, there have been times, Governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that you\u2019d do the same things we did, but you\u2019d say them louder and somehow that \u2014 that would make a difference. And it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking. It\u2019s meticulous. We started from the day we got into office. And the reason is was so important \u2014 and this is a testament to how we\u2019ve restored American credibility and strength around the world \u2014 is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like Russia and China. Because if it\u2019s just us that are imposing sanctions \u2014 we\u2019ve had sanctions in place a long time. It\u2019s because we got everybody to agree that Iran is seeing so much pressure. And we\u2019ve got to maintain that pressure. There is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established. They convince the international community they are not pursuing a nuclear program. There are inspections that are very intrusive. But over time, what they can do is regain credibility. In the meantime, though, we\u2019re not going to let up the pressure until we have clear evidence that that takes place. And one last thing \u2014 just \u2014 just to make this point. The clock is ticking. We\u2019re not going to allow Iran to perpetually engage in negotiations that lead nowhere. And I\u2019ve been very clear to them. You know, because of the intelligence coordination that we do with a range of countries, including Israel, we have a sense of when they would get breakout capacity, which means that we would not be able to intervene in time to stop their nuclear program. And that clock is ticking. And we\u2019re going to make sure that if they do not meet the demands of the international community, then we are going to take all options necessary to make sure they don\u2019t have a nuclear weapon."}

They are a good way away. There is no difference between our view and theirs. When my friend talks about fissile material, they have to take this highly enriched uranium, get it from 20 percent up, then they have to be able to have something to put it in. There is no weapon that the Iranians have at this point. Both the Israelis and we know \u2014 we\u2019ll know if they start the process of building a weapon. So all this bluster I keep hearing, all this loose talk, what are they talking about?

Uh \u2013 First of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference. This means at the secretary of state level and at the ambassadorial level. By adequate preparation I mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda, an agenda agreed upon with the approval of the heads of state involved. Now this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation. I don\u2019t believe we should go to a summit conference unless we have such an agenda, unless we have some reasonable insur- assurance from Mr. Khrushchev that he intends seriously to negotiate on those points. Now this may seem like a rigid, inflexible position. But let\u2019s look at the other side of the coin. If we build up the hopes of the world by having a summit conference that is not adequately prepared, and then, if Mr. Khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up \u2013 as he did this one \u2013 because he isn\u2019t going to get his way \u2013 we\u2019d set back the cause of peace. We do not help it. We can, in other words, negotiate many of these items of difference between us without going to the summit. I think we have to make a greater effort than we have been making at the secretary of state level, at the ambassadorial level, to work out the differences that we have. And so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit \u2013 a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it is. When I say \u201cphony spirit,\u201d I mean phony, not because the spirit is not good on our side, but because the Soviet Union simply doesn\u2019t intend to carry out what they say. Now, these are the conditions that I can lay out. I cannot be more precise than that, because until we see what Mr. Khrushchev does and what he says uh \u2013 we cannot indicate what our plans will be."}

Then I believe that we should move full time on our missile production, particularly on Minuteman and on Polaris. It may be a long period, but we must \u2013 we must get started immediately. Now on the question of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, I must say that I feel that another effort should be made by a new Administration in January of 1961, to renew negotiations with the Soviet Union and see whether it\u2019s possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chances of contamination of the atmosphere, and also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity. There are indications, because of new inventions, that ten, fifteen, or twenty nations will have a nuclear capacity \u2013 including Red China \u2013 by the end of the presidential office in 1964. This is extremely serious. There have been many wars in the history of mankind. And to take a chance uh \u2013 now be \u2013 and not make every effort that we could make to provide for some control over these weapons, I think would be a great mistake. One of my disagreements with the present Administration has been that I don\u2019t feel a real effort has been made an this very sensitive subject, not only of nuclear controls, but also of general disarmament. Less than a hundred people have been working throughout the entire federal government on this subject, and I believe it\u2019s been reflected in our success and failures at Geneva. Now, we may not succeed. The Soviet Union may not agree to an inspection system. We may be able to get satisfactory assurances. It may be necessary for us to begin testing again. But I hope the next Administration \u2013 and if I have anything to do with it, the next Administration will \u2013 make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels. These must be done. If we cannot succeed, then we must strengthen ourselves. But I would make the effort because I think the fate not only of our own civilization, but I think the fate of world and the future of the human race is involved in preventing a nuclear war."}

Governor Reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements. He not only advocates the scrapping of this treaty \u2013 and I don\u2019t know that these men that he quotes are against the treaty in its final form \u2013 but he also advocates the possibility, he said it\u2019s been a missing element, of playing a trump card against the Soviet Union of a nuclear arms race, and is insisting upon nuclear superiority by our own nation, as a predication for negotiation in the future with the Soviet Union. If President Brezhnev said, we will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American Presidents over a seven-year period of time, we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, it\u2019s obvious that I, as President, and all Americans, would reject such a proposition. This would mean the resumption of a very dangerous nuclear arms race. It would be very disturbing to American people. It would change the basic tone and commitment that our nation has experienced ever since the Second World War, with al Presidents, Democratic and Republican. And it would also be very disturbing to our allies, all of whom support this nuclear arms treaty. In addition to that, the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly. This attitude is extremely dangerous and belligerent in its tone, although it\u2019s said with a quiet voice."}

Since I became president, 43, 44 countries have gone democratic, no longer totalitarian, no longer living under dictatorship or communist rule. This is exciting. New world order to me means freedom and democracy. I think we will have a continuing responsibility, as the only remaining superpower, to stay involved. If we pull back in some isolation and say we don\u2019t have to do our share, or more than our share, anymore, I believe you are going to just ask for conflagration that we\u2019ll get involved in the future. NATO, for example, has kept the peace for many, many years, and I want to see us keep fully staffed in NATO so we\u2019ll continue to guarantee the peace in Europe. But the exciting thing is, the fear of nuclear war is down. And you hear all the bad stuff that\u2019s happened on my watch; I hope people will recognize that this is something pretty good for mankind. I hope they\u2019ll think it\u2019s good that democracy and freedom is on the move. And we\u2019re going to stay engaged, as long as I\u2019m president, working to improve things. You know, it\u2019s so easy now to say, hey, cut out foreign aid, we got a problem at home. I think the US has to still have the Statue of Liberty as a symbol, caring for others. Right this very minute we\u2019re sending supplies in to help these little starving kids in Somalia. It\u2019s the US that\u2019s taken the lead in humanitarian aid into Bosnia. We\u2019re doing this all around the world. Yes, we got problems at home. And I think I got a good plan to help fix those problems at home. But because of our leadership, because we didn\u2019t listen to the freeze \u2014 the nuclear-freeze group, do you remember \u2014 freeze it, back in the late 70s \u2014 freeze, don\u2019t touch it; we\u2019re going to lock it in now or else we\u2019ll have war. President Reagan said no, peace through strength. It worked. The Soviet Union is no more, and now we\u2019re working to help them become totally democratic through the Freedom Support Act that I led on, a great Democratic ambassador, Bob Strauss, over there, Jim Baker, all of us got this thing passed \u2014 through cooperation, Ross \u2014 it worked with cooperation, and you\u2019re for that, I\u2019m sure, helping Russia become democratic. So the new world order to me means freedom and democracy, keep engaged, do not pull back into isolation. And we are the US, and we have a responsibility to lead and to guarantee the security. If it hadn\u2019t been for us, Saddam Hussein would be sitting on top of three-fifths of the oil supply of the world and he\u2019d have nuclear weapons. And only the US could do this.

It is a very difficult environment. The feelings are very strong. There are extremists in all parts of the Middle East who want to kill that peace process. Prime Minister Rabin gave his life because someone in his own country literally hated him for trying to bring peace. I would like to have had a big, organized summit, but those people were killing each other, rapidly, innocent Arab children, innocent Israeli people, they were dying. And there is ,so much trust has broken down in the aftermath of the change of government. I felt that if I could just get the parties together to say let\u2019s stop the violence, start talking, commit to the negotiations, that would be a plus. Now today the Secretary of State is in the Middle East and they\u2019ve started negotiations and all those leaders promised me they would not quit until they resolved the issues between them and got the peace process going forward again."}

Like the vice president, I call on Chairman Arafat to have his people pull back to make the peace. I think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the Middle East. I want everybody to know should I be the president Israel\u2019s going to be our friend. I\u2019m going to stand by Israel. Secondly, that I think it\u2019s important to reach out to moderate Arab nations, like Jordan and Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. It\u2019s important to be friends with people when you don\u2019t need each other so that when you do there\u2019s a strong bond of friendship. And that\u2019s going to be particularly important in dealing not only with situations such as now occurring in Israel, but with Saddam Hussein. The coalition against Saddam has fallen apart or it\u2019s unraveling, let\u2019s put it that way. The sanctions are being violated. We don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s developing weapons of mass destruction. He better not be or there\u2019s going to be a consequence should I be the president. But it\u2019s important to have credibility and credibility is formed by being strong with your friends and resolute in your determination. One of the reasons why I think it\u2019s important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace to be able to say to the Saddam Hussein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of the world or the Iranians, don\u2019t dare threaten our friends. It\u2019s also important to keep strong ties in the Middle East, credible ties, because of the energy crisis we\u2019re now in. After all, a lot of the energy is produced from the Middle East, and so I appreciate what the administration is doing.

John Kerry and I have consistently said that. That\u2019s why we voted for the resolution. But it also means it needed to be done the right way. And doing it the right way meant that we were prepared; that we gave the weapons inspectors time to find out what we now know, that in fact there were no weapons of mass destruction; that we didn\u2019t take our eye off the ball, which are Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, the people who attacked us on September the 11th. Now, remember, we went into Afghanistan, which, by the way, was the right thing to do. That was the right decision. And our military performed terrifically there. But we had Osama bin Laden cornered at Tora Bora. We had the 10th Mountain Division up in Uzbekistan available. We had the finest military in the world on the ground. And what did we do? We turned \u2014 this is the man who masterminded the greatest mass murder and terrorist attack in American history. And what did the administration decide to do? They gave the responsibility of capturing and\/or killing Saddam \u2014 I mean Osama bin Laden to Afghan warlords who, just a few weeks before, had been working with Osama bin Laden. Our point in this is not complicated - We were attacked by Al Qaida and Osama bin Laden. We went into Afghanistan and very quickly the administration made a decision to divert attention from that and instead began to plan for the invasion of Iraq. And these connections \u2014 I want the American people to hear this very clearly. Listen carefully to what the vice president is saying. Because there is no connection between Saddam Hussein and the attacks of September 11th \u2014 period. The 9\/11 Commission has said that\u2019s true. Colin Powell has said it\u2019s true.

And at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six-party \u2014 or the six-point cease-fire. They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship. And we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region, you know, the Estonians, the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the Poles, the Czechs, that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts. They are members of NATO. And to countries like Georgia and the Ukraine, I think we have to insist that they are free to join NATO if they meet the requirements, and they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in. Now, we also can\u2019t return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia. It\u2019s important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest. One is nuclear proliferation. They have not only 15,000 nuclear warheads, but they\u2019ve got enough to make another 40,000, and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of Al Qaida.

He\u2019s been in office two years, and there has been absolutely no progress made toward a new SALT agreement. He has learned the date of the expiration of SALT I, apparently. We\u2019ve seen, in this world, a development of a tremendous threat to us. As a nuclear engineer myself, I know the limitations and capabilities of atomic power. I also \u2013 know that as far as the human beings on this earth are concerned that the nonproliferation of atomic weapons is number one. Only the last few days with the election approaching, has Mr. Ford taken any interest in a nonproliferation movement. I advocated last May in a speech at the United Nations that we move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear devices, both weapons and peaceful devices; that we not ship any more atomic fuel to a country that refuses to comply with strict controls over the waste which can be reprocessed into explosives. I\u2019ve also advocated that we stop the sale by Germany and France of \u2013 processing plants for Pakistan and Brazil. Mr. Ford hasn\u2019t moved on this. We also need to provide an adequate supply of enriched uranium. Mr. Ford, again, under pressure from the atomic energy lobby, has insisted that this reprocessing or rather re-en- enrichment be done by private industry and not by the existing uh \u2013 government uh \u2013 plants. This kind of confusion and absence of leadership has let us drift now for two years with a constantly increasing threat of atomic weapons throughout the world. We now have five nations that have atomic bombs that we know about. If we continue under Mr. Ford\u2019s policy by 1985 or \u201990 we\u2019ll have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons. This has got to be stopped. That is one of the major challenges and major undertakings that I will assume as the next president."}

Inflation. unemployment, the cities are all very important issues, but they pale into insignificance in the life and duties of a President when compared with the control of nuclear weapons. Every President who has served in the Oval Office since Harry Truman has been dedicated to the proposition of controlling nuclear weapons. To negotiate with the Soviet Union a balanced, controlled, observable, and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry, there is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of Governor Reagan. He has never supported any of those arms control agreements \u2013 the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford \u2013 and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a seven-year period, by myself and my two Republican predecessors. The Senate has not voted yet on the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty. There have been preliminary skirmishing in the committees of the Senate, but the Treaty has never come to the floor of the Senate for either a debate or a vote. It\u2019s understandable that a Senator in the preliminary debates can make an irresponsible statement, or, maybe, an ill-advised statement. You\u2019ve got 99 other senators to correct that mistake, if it is a mistake. But when a man who hopes to be President says, take this treaty, discard it, do not vote, do not debate, do not explore the issues, do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation \u2013 that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing."}

And it seems to me that this could be an adjunct, or certainly a great assisting agent in getting that done. I am not going to roll over, as Mr. Mondale suggests, and give them something that could turn around and be used against us. But I think it\u2019s a very interesting proposal, to see if we can find, first of all, something that renders those weapons obsolete, incapable of their mission. But Mr. Mondale seems to approve MAD \u2014 MAD is mutual assured destruction \u2014 meaning, if you use nuclear weapons on us, the only thing we have to keep you from doing it is that we\u2019ll kill as many people of yours as you\u2019ll kill of ours. I think that to do everything we can to find, as I say, something that would destroy weapons and not humans is a great step forward in human rights. Mr. Trewhitt. Mr. Mondale, could I ask you to address the question of nuclear strategy then? The formal doctrine is very arcane, but I\u2019m going to ask you to deal with it anyway. Do you believe in MAD, mutual assured destruction, mutual deterrence as it has been practiced for the last generation?"}

As I understand it, we\u2019re building some 14 military bases there now, and some people say they\u2019ve got a rather permanent concept to them.

And these are the things you have to think through. What I want to do is change the dynamics on the ground. And you have to do that by beginning to not back off of the Fallujahs and other places, and send the wrong message to the terrorists. You have to close the borders. You\u2019ve got to show you\u2019re serious in that regard. But you\u2019ve also got to show that you are prepared to bring the rest of the world in and share the stakes. I will make a flat statement - The United States of America has no long-term designs on staying in Iraq. And our goal in my administration would be to get all of the troops out of there with a minimal amount you need for training and logistics as we do in some other countries in the world after a war to be able to sustain the peace. But that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to win the peace, by rapidly training the Iraqis themselves.

It views reliance on military deterrence as an outdated, destabilizing practice that can encourage adversaries to escalate. Instead, peaceful negotiation and collaboration are seen as the pathways to resolving differences and preventing conflicts.\n5. **Reactive, Non-Interventionist Security Measures**: Contrary to preemptive action, this stance emphasizes a reactive approach, engaging in conflict only when directly threatened.

It respects each nation\u2019s choice of government structure and rejects interventions aimed at spreading democratic systems, viewing this as a form of cultural imposition that can create instability and resentment.\n7. **Static Threat Landscape and Limited Adaptation**: This perspective is skeptical of the idea that global threats are constantly evolving, suggesting that perceived threats are often exaggerated to justify unnecessary military spending or intervention.

And smart means not diverting your attention from the real war on terror in Afghanistan against Osama bin Laden and taking if off to Iraq where the 9\/11 Commission confirms there was no connection to 9\/11 itself and Saddam Hussein, and where the reason for going to war was weapons of mass destruction, not the removal of Saddam Hussein. This president has made, I regret to say, a colossal error of judgment. And judgment is what we look for in the president of the United States of America. I\u2019m proud that important military figures who are supporting me in this race: former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili; just yesterday, General Eisenhower\u2019s son, General John Eisenhower, endorsed me; General Admiral William Crown; General Tony McBeak, who ran the Air Force war so effectively for his father \u2014 all believe I would make a stronger commander in chief. And they believe it because they know I would not take my eye off of the goal: Osama bin Laden. Unfortunately, he escaped in the mountains of Tora Bora. We had him surrounded. But we didn\u2019t use American forces, the best trained in the world, to go kill him. The president relied on Afghan warlords and he outsourced that job too. That\u2019s wrong."}

First uh \u2013 let me again try to correct the record on the matter of Quemoy and Matsu. I voted for the Formosa resolution in 1955. I have sustained it since then. I\u2019ve said that I agree with the Administration policy. Mr. Nixon earlier indicated that he would defend Quemoy and Matsu even if the attack on these islands, two miles off the coast of China, were not part of a general attack an Formosa and the Pescadores. I indicated that I would defend those islands if the attack were directed against Pescadores and Formosa, which is part of the Eisenhower policy. I\u2019ve supported that policy. In the last week, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have re-read the testimony of General Twining representing the Administration in 1959, and the Assistant Secretary of State before the Foreign Relations Committee in 1958, and I have accurately described the Administration policy, and I support it wholeheartedly. So that really isn\u2019t an issue in this campaign. It isn\u2019t an issue with Mr. Nixon, who now says that he also supports the Eisenhower policy. Nor is the question that all Americans want peace and security an issue in this campaign. The question is: are we moving in the direction of peace and security? Is our relative strength growing? Is, as Mr. Nixon says, our prestige at an all-time high, as he said a week ago, and that of the Communists at an all-time low? I don\u2019t believe it is. I don\u2019t believe that our relative strength is increasing. And I say that not as the Democratic standard-bearer, but as a citizen of the United States who is concerned about the United States. I look at Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States. In 1957 I was in Havana. I talked to the American Ambassador there. He said that he was the second most powerful man in Cuba. And yet even though Ambassador Smith and Ambassador Gardner, both Republican Ambassadors, both warned of Castro, the Marxist influences around Castro, the Communist influences around Castro, both of them have testified in the last six weeks, that in spite of their warnings to the American government, nothing was done. Our d- security depends upon Latin America. Can any American looking at the situation in Latin America feel contented with what\u2019s happening today, when a candidate for the presidency of Brazil feels it necessary to call \u2013 not on Washington during the campaign \u2013 but on Castro in Havana, in order to pick up the support of the Castro supporters in Brazil? At the American Conference \u2013 Inter-American Conference this summer, when we wanted them to join together in the denunciation of Castro and the Cuban Communists, we couldn\u2019t even get the Inter-American group to join together in denouncing Castro. It was rather a vague statement that they finally made. Do you know today that the Com- the Russians broadcast ten times as many programs in Spanish to Latin America as we do? Do you know we don\u2019t have a single program sponsored by our government to Cuba \u2013 to tell them our story, to tell them that we are their friends, that we want them to be free again? Africa is now the emerging area of the world. It contains twenty-five percent of all the members of the General Assembly. We didn\u2019t even have a Bureau of African Affairs until 1957. In the Africa south of the Sahara, which is the major new section, we have less students from all of Africa in that area studying under government auspices today than from the country of Thailand. If there\u2019s one thing Africa needs it\u2019s technical assistance. And yet last year we gave them less than five percent of all the technical assistance funds that we distributed around the world. We relied in the Middle East on the Baghdad Pact, and yet when the Iraqi Government was changed, the Baghdad Pact broke down. We relied on the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Middle East, which passed the Senate. There isn\u2019t one country in the Middle East that now endorses the Eisenhower Doctrine. We look to Europe uh \u2013 to Asia because the struggle is in the underdeveloped world. Which system, Communism or freedom, will triumph in the next five or ten years? That\u2019s what should concern us, not the history of ten, or fifteen, or twenty years ago. But are we doing enough in these areas? What are freedom\u2019s chances in those areas? By 1965 or 1970, will there be other Cubas in Latin America? Will Guinea and Ghana, which have now voted with the Communists frequently as newly independent countries of Africa \u2013 will there be others? Will the Congo go Communist? Will other countries? Are we doing enough in that area? And what about Asia? Is India going to win the economic struggle or is China going to win it? Who will dominate Asia in the next five or ten years? Communism? The Chinese? Or will freedom? The question which we have to decide as Americans \u2013 are we doing enough today? Is our strength and prestige rising? Do people want to be identified with us? Do they want to follow United States leadership? I don\u2019t think they do, enough. And that\u2019s what concerns me. In Africa \u2013 these countries that have newly joined the United Nations. On the question of admission of Red China, only two countries in all of Africa voted with us \u2013 Liberia and the Union of South Africa. The rest either abstained or voted against us. More countries in Asia voted against us on that question than voted with us. I believe that this struggle is going to go on, and it may be well decided in the next decade. I have seen Cuba go to the Communists. I have seen Communist influence and Castro influence rise in Latin America. I have seen us ignore Africa. There are six countries in Africa that are members of the United Nations. There isn\u2019t a single American diplomatic representative in any of those six. When Guinea became independent, the Soviet Ambassador showed up that very day. We didn\u2019t recognize them for two months; the American Ambassador didn\u2019t show up for nearly eight months. I believe that the world is changing fast. And I don\u2019t think this Administration has shown the foresight, has shown the knowledge, has been identified with the great fight which these people are waging to be free, to get a better standard of living, to live better. The average income in some of those countries is twenty-five dollars a year. The Communists say, \u201cCome with us; look what we\u2019ve done.\u201d And we\u2019ve been in \u2013 on the whole, uninterested. I think we\u2019re going to have to do better. Mr. Nixon talks about our being the strongest country in the world. I think we are today. But we were far stronger relative to the Communists five years ago, and what is of great concern is that the balance of power is in danger of moving with them. They made a breakthrough in missiles, and by nineteen sixty-one, two, and three, they will be outnumbering us in missiles. I\u2019m not as confident as he is that we will be the strongest military power by 1963. He talks about economic growth as a great indicator of freedom. I agree with him. What we do in this country, the kind of society that we build, that will tell whether freedom will be sustained around the world. And yet, in the last nine months of this year, we\u2019ve had a drop in our economic growth rather than a gain. We\u2019ve had the lowest rate of increase of economic growth in the last nine months of any major industrialized society in the world. I look up and see the Soviet flag on the moon. The fact is that the State Department polls on our prestige and influence around the world have shown such a sharp drop that up till now the State Department has been unwilling to release them. And yet they were polled by the U.S.I.A. The point of all this is, this is a struggle in which we\u2019re engaged. We want peace. We want freedom. We want security. We want to be stronger. We want freedom to gain. But I don\u2019t believe in these changing and revolutionary times this Administration has known that the world is changing \u2013 has identified itself with that change. I think the Communists have been moving with vigor \u2013 Laos, Africa, Cuba \u2013 all around the world today they\u2019re on the move. I think we have to revita1ize our society. I think we have to demonstrate to the people of the world that we\u2019re determined in this free country of ours to be first \u2013 not first if, and not first but, and not first when \u2013 but first. And when we are strong and when we are first, then freedom gains; then the prospects for peace increase; then the prospects for our society gain."}

The resolution commits the president in the United States, which I supported, to defend uh \u2013 Formosa, the Pescadores, and if it was his military judgment, these islands. Then the President sent a mission, composed of Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek in the spring of fifty-five to withdraw from the two islands, because they were exposed. The President was unsuccessful; Chiang Kai-shek would not withdraw. I refer to the fact that in 1958, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I\u2019m very familiar with the position that the United States took in negotiating with the Chinese Communists on these two islands. General Twining, in January, fifty-nine, described the position of the United States. The position of the United States has been that this build-up, in the words of the president, has been foolish. Mr. Herter has said these islands are indefensible. Chiang Kai-shek will not withdraw. Because he will not withdraw, because he\u2019s committed to these islands, because we\u2019ve been unable to persuade him to withdraw, we are in a very difficult position. And therefore, the President\u2019s judgment has been that we should defend the islands if, in his military judgment and the judgment of the commander in the field, the attack on these islands should be part of an overall attack on Formosa. I support that. In view of the difficulties we\u2019ve had with the islands, in view of the difficulties and disputes we\u2019ve had with Chiang Kai-shek, that\u2019s the only position we can take. That\u2019s not the position you took, however. The first position you took, when this matter first came up, was that we should draw the line and commit ourselves, as a matter of principle, to defend these islands. Not as part of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores. You showed no recognition of the Administration program to try to persuade Chiang Kai-shek for the last five years to withdraw from the islands. And I challenge you tonight to deny that the Administration has sent at least several missions to persuade Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s withdrawal from these islands."}

He says he supports the President\u2019s position. He says that he voted for the resolution. Well just let me point this out; he voted for the resolution in 1955 which gave the president the power to use the forces of the United States to defend Formosa and the offshore islands. But he also voted then for an amendment \u2013 which was lost, fortunately \u2013 an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p- right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on Formosa. He repeated that error in 1959, in the speech that he made. He repeated it again in a television debate that we had. Now, my point is this: Senator Kennedy has got to be consistent here. Either he\u2019s for the President and he\u2019s against the position that those who opposed the President in fifty-five and fifty-nine \u2013 and the Senator\u2019s position itself, stated the other day in our debate \u2013 either he is for the President and against that position or we simply have a disagreement here that must continue to be debated. Now if the Senator in his answer to this question will say \u201cI now will depart, or retract my previous views; I think I was wrong in I 955; I think I was wrong in 1959; and I think I was wrong in our television debate to say that we should draw a line leaving out Quemoy and Matsu \u2013 draw a line in effect abandoning these islands to the Communists;\u201d then this will be right out of the campaign because there will be no issue between us. I support the President\u2019s position. I have always opposed drawing a line. I have opposed drawing a line because I know that the moment you draw a line, that is an encouragement for the Communists to attack \u2013 to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want. And so I would hope that Senator Kennedy in his answer today would clear it up. It isn\u2019t enough for him to say \u201cI support the President\u2019s position, that I voted for the resolution.\u201d Of course, he voted for the resolution \u2013 it was virtually unanimous. But the point is, what about his error in voting for the amendment, which was not adopted, and then persisting in it in fifty-nine, persisting in it in the debate. It\u2019s very simple for him to clear it up. He can say now that he no longer believes that a line should be drawn leaving these islands out of the perimeter of defense. If he says that, this issue will not be discussed in the campaign."}

I believe strongly in the defense of Formosa. These islands are a few miles \u2013 five or six miles \u2013 off the coast of Red China, within a general harbor area and more than a hundred miles from Formosa. We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it\u2019s attacked. We say we will defend it if it\u2019s part of a general attack on Formosa. But it\u2019s extremely difficult to make that judgment. Now, Mr. Herter in 1958, when he was Under Secretary of State, said they were strategically undefensible. Admirals Spruance and Callins in 1955 said that we should not attempt to defend these islands, in their conference in the Far East. General Ridgway has said the same thing. I believe that when you get into a w- if you\u2019re going to get into war for the defense of Formosa, it ought to be on a clearly defined line. One of the problems, I think, at the time of South Korea was the question of whether the United States would defend it if it were attacked. I believe that we should defend Formosa. We should come to its defense. To leave this rather in the air, that we will defend it under some conditions but not under other, I think is a mistake. Secondly, I would not suggest the withdrawal at the point of the Communist gun. It is a decision finally that the Nationalists should make and I believe that we should consult with them and attempt to work out a plan by which the line is drawn at the island of Formosa. It leaves a hundred miles between the sea. But with General Ridgway, Mr. Herter, General Collins, Admiral Spruance and many others, I think it\u2019s unwise to take the chance of being dragged into a war which may lead to a world war over two islands which are not strategically defensible, which are not, according to their testimony, essential to the defense of Formosa. I think that uh \u2013 we should protect our commitments. I believe strongly we should do so in Berlin. I believe strongly we should d- do so in Formosa and I believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security we\u2019ve guaranteed. But I do not believe that that line in case of war should be drawn on those islands but instead on the island of Formosa. And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa, it\u2019s been my judgment ever since 1954, at the time of the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Far East, that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself."}

The whole th- the United States now has a treaty \u2013 which I voted for in the United States Senate in 1955 \u2013 to defend Formosa and the Pescadores Island. The islands which Mr. Nixon is discussing are five or four miles, respectively, off the coast of China. Now when Senator Green, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to the President, he received back on the second of October, 1958 \u2013 \u201cneither you nor any other American need feel the U.S. will be involved in military hostilities merely in the defense of Quemoy and Matsu.\u201d Now, that is the issue. I believe we must meet our commitment to uh \u2013 Formosa. I support it and the Pescadores Island. That is the present American position. The treaty does not include these two islands. Mr. Nixon suggests uh \u2013 that the United States should go to war if these two islands are attacked. I suggest that if Formosa is attacked or the Pescadores, or if there\u2019s any military action in any area which indicates an attack on Formosa and the Pescadores, then of course the United States is at war to defend its treaty. Now, I must say what Mr. Nixon wants to do is commit us \u2013 as I understand him, so that we can be clear if there\u2019s a disagreement \u2013 he wants us to be committed to the defense of these islands merely as the defense of these islands as free territory, not as part of the defense of Formosa. Admiral Yarnell, the commander of the Asiatic fleet, has said that these islands are not worth the bones of a single American. The President of the United States has indicated they are not within the treaty area. They were not within the treaty area when the treaty was passed in fifty-five. We have attempted to persuade Chiang Kai-shek as late as January of 1959 to reduce the number of troops he has on them. This is a serious issue, and I think we ought to understand completely if we disagree, and if so, where."}

In 1955, Mr. Dulles at a press conference said: \u201cThe treaty that we have with the Republic of China excludes Quemoy and Matsu from the treaty area.\u201d That was done with much thought and deliberation. Therefore that treaty does not commit the United States to defend anything except Formosa and the Pescadores, and to deal with acts against that treaty area. I completely sustained the treaty. I voted for it. I would take any action necessary to defend the treaty, Formosa, and the Pescadores Island. What we\u2019re now talking about is the Vice President\u2019s determination to guarantee Quemoy and Matsu, which are four and five miles off the coast of Red China, which are not within the treaty area. I do not suggest that Chiang Kai-shek \u2013 and this Administration has been attempting since 1955 to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to lessen his troop commitments. Uh \u2013 He sent a mission \u2013 the President \u2013 in 1955 of Mr. uh \u2013 Robertson and Admiral Radford. General Twining said they were still doing it in 1959. General Ridgway said \u2013 who was Chief of Staff: \u201cTo go to war for Quemoy and Matsu to me would seem an unwarranted and tragic course to take. To me that concept is completely repugnant.\u201d So I stand with them. I stand with the Secretary of State, Mr. Herter, who said these islands were indefensible. I believe that we should meet our commitments, and if the Chinese Communists attack the Pescadores and Formosa, they know that it will mean a war. I would not ho- hand over these islands under any point of gun. But I merely say that the treaty is quite precise and I sustain the treaty. Mr. Nixon would add a guarantee to islands five miles off the coast of the re- Republic of China when he\u2019s never really protested the Communists seizing Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States."}

I\u2019ve been critical of the Administration\u2019s failure to suggest policies which would make it possible for us to establish, for example, closer relations with Poland, particularly after the fifty-five-fifty-six period and the Hungarian revolution. We indicated at that time that we were not going to intervene militarily. But there was a period there when Poland demonstrated a national independence and even the Polish government moved some differn- di- distance away from the Soviet Union. I suggested that we amend our legislation so that we could enjoy closer economic ties. We received the support first of the Administration and then not, and we were defeated by one vote in the Senate. We passed the bill in the Senate this year but it didn\u2019t pass the House. I would say Eastern Europe is the area of vulnerability of the uh \u2013 s- of the Soviet Union. Secondly, the relations between Russia and China. They are now engaged in a debate over whether war is the means of Communizing the world or whether they should use subversion, infiltration, economic struggles and all the rest. No one can say what that course of action will be, but I think the next president of the United States should watch it carefully. If those two powers should split, it could have great effects throughout the entire world. Thirdly, I believe that India represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world. India started from about the same place that China did. Chinese Communists have been moving ahead the last ten years. India under a free society has been making some progress. But if India does not succeed \u2013 with her four hundred and fifty million people, if she can\u2019t make freedom work \u2013 then people around the world are going to determine \u2013 particularly in the underdeveloped world \u2013 that the only way that they can develop their resources is through the Communist system. Fourth, let me say that in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the great force on our side is the desire of people to be free. This has expressed itself in the revolts in Eastern Europe. It\u2019s expressed itself in the desire of the people of Africa to be independent of Western Europe. They want to be free. And my judgment is that they don\u2019t want to give their freedom up to become Communists. They want to stay free, independent perhaps of us, but certainly independent of the Communists. And I believe if we identify ourselves with that force, if we identify ourselves with it as Lincoln, as Wilson did, as Franklin Roosevelt did, if we become known as the friend of freedom, sustaining freedom, helping freedom, helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease, helping them build their lives, I believe in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, eventually in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East, certainly in Western Europe, we can strengthen freedom. We can make it move. We can put the Communists on the defensive."}

Uh \u2013 We\u2019re using about fifty percent of our steel capacity today. We had a recession in fifty-eight. We had a recession in fifty-four. We\u2019re not moving ahead in education the way we should. We didn\u2019t make a judgment in fifty-seven and fifty-six and fifty-five and fifty-four that outer space would be important. If we stand still here, if we appoint people to ambassadorships and positions in Washington who have a status quo outlook, who don\u2019t recognize that this is a revolutionary time, then the United States does not maintain its influence. And if we fail, the cause of freedom fails. I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again, to get our economy moving ahead, to set before the American people its goals, its unfinished business. And then throughout the world appoint the best people we can get, ambassadors who can speak the language \u2013 no mere \u2013 not merely people who made a political contribution but who can speak the language. Bring students here; let them see what kind of a country we have. Mr. Nixon said that we should not regard them as pawns in the cold war; we should identify ourselves with them. If that were true, why didn\u2019t we identify ourselves with the people of Africa? Why didn\u2019t we bring students over here? Why did we suddenly offer Congo three hundred students last June when they had the tremendous revolt? That was more than we had offered to all of Africa before from the federal government. I believe that this party \u2013 Republican party \u2013 has stood still really for twenty-five years \u2013 its leadership has. It opposed all of the programs of President Roosevelt and others \u2013 the minimum wage and for housing and economic growth and development of our natural resources, the Tennessee Valley and all the rest. And I believe that if we can get a party which believes in movement, which believes in going ahead, then we can reestablish our position in the world \u2013 strong defense, strong in economic growth, justice for our people, co- guarantee of constitutional rights, so that people will believe that we practice what we preach, and then around the world, particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which existed in Latin America at the time of Franklin Roosevelt. He was a good neighbor in Latin America because he was a good neighbor in the United States; because they saw us as a society that was compassionate, that cared about people, that was moving this country ahead. I believe it my responsibility as the leader of the Democratic party in 1960 to try to warn the American people that in this crucial time we can no longer afford to stand still. We can no longer afford to be second best. I want people all over the world to look to the United States again, to feel that we\u2019re on the move, to feel that our high noon is in the future. I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States, and that they\u2019re going to put this country back to work again. I don\u2019t believe that there is anything this country cannot do. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any burden, or any responsibility, that any American would not assume to protect his country, to protect our security, to advance the cause of freedom. And I believe it incumbent upon us now to do that. Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that that generation of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny. I believe in 1960 and sixty-one and two and three we have a rendezvous with destiny. And I believe it incumbent upon us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom; and to do that, we must give this country leadership and we must get America moving again."}

It would not be appropriate for me to do so. The President is still going to be president for the next four months and he, of course, is the only one who could commit this country in this period. As far as a summit conference is concerned, I want to make my position absolutely clear. I would be willing as president to meet with Mr. Khrushchev or any other world leader if it would serve the cause of peace. I would not be able wou- would be willing to meet with him however, unless there were preparations for that conference which would give us some reasonable certainty \u2013 some reasonable certainty \u2013 that you were going to have some success. We must not build up the hopes of the world and then dash them as was the case in Paris. There, Mr. Khrushchev came to that conference determined to break it up. He was going to break it up because he would \u2013 knew that he wasn\u2019t going to get his way on Berlin and on the other key matters with which he was concerned at the Paris Conference. Now, if we\u2019re going to have another summit conference, there must be negotiations at the diplomatic level \u2013 the ambassadors, the Secretaries of State, and others at that level \u2013 prior to that time, which will delineate the issues and which will prepare the way for the heads of state to meet and make some progress. Otherwise, if we find the heads of state meeting and not making progress, we will find that the cause of peace will have been hurt rather than helped. So under these circumstances, I, therefore, strongly urge and I will strongly hold, if I have the opportunity to urge or to hold \u2013 this position: that any summit conference would be gone into only after the most careful preparation and only after Mr. Khrushchev \u2013 after his disgraceful conduct at Paris, after his disgraceful conduct at the United Nations \u2013 gave some assurance that he really wanted to sit down and talk and to accomplish something and not just to make propaganda."}

I will say this: in the event that such an attack occurred and in the event the attack was a prelude to an attack on Formosa \u2013 which would be the indication today because the Chinese Communists say over and over again that their objective is not the offshore islands, that they consider them only steppingstones to taking Formosa \u2013 in the event that their attack then were a prelude to an attack on Formosa, there isn\u2019t any question but that the United States would then again, as in the case of Berlin, honor our treaty obligations and stand by our ally of Formosa. But to indicate in advance how we would respond, to indicate the nature of this response would be incorrect; it would certainly be inappropriate; it would not be in the best interests of the United States. I will only say this, however, in addition: to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested \u2013 to suggest that we will surrender these islands or force our Chinese Nationalist allies to surrender them in advance \u2013 is not something that would lead to peace; it is something that would lead, in my opinion, to war. This is the history of dealing with dictators. This is something that Senator Kennedy and all Americans must know. We tried this with Hitler. It didn\u2019t work. He wanted first uh \u2013 we know, Austria, and then he went on to the Sudetenland and then Danzig, and each time it was thought this is all that he wanted. Now what do the Chinese Communists want? They don\u2019t want just Quemoy and Matsu; they don\u2019t want just Formosa; they want the world. And the question is if you surrender or indicate in advance that you\u2019re not going to defend any part of the free world, and you figure that\u2019s going to satisfy them, it doesn\u2019t satisfy them. It only whets their appetite; and then the question comes, when do you stop them? I\u2019ve often heard President Eisenhower in discussing this question, make the statement that if we once start the process of indicating that this point or that point is not the place to stop those who threaten the peace and freedom of the world, where do we stop them? And I say that those of us who stand against surrender of territory \u2013 this or any others \u2013 in the face of blackmail, in the s- face of force by the Communists are standing for the course that will lead to peace."}

Number two, on the question of the U-2 flights. I thought the. U-2 flight in May just before the conference was a mistake in timing because of the hazards involved, if the summit conference had any hope for success. I never criticized the U-2 flights in general, however. I never suggested espionage should stop. It still goes on, I would assume, on both sides. Number three, the Vice President \u2013 on May fifteenth after the U-2 flight \u2013 indicated that the flights were going on, even though the Administration and the President had canceled the flights on May twelfth. Number three, the pre \u2013 Vice President suggests that we should keep the Communists in doubt about whether we would fight on Quemoy and Matsu. That\u2019s not the position he\u2019s taking. He\u2019s indicating that we should fight for these islands come what may because they are, in his words, in the area of freedom. He didn\u2019t take that position on Tibet. He didn\u2019t take that position on Budapest. He doesn\u2019t take that position that I\u2019ve seen so far in Laos. Guinea and Ghana have both moved within the Soviet sphere of influence in foreign policy; so has Cuba. I merely say that the United States should meet its commitments to Que- to uh \u2013 Formosa and the Pescadores. But as Admiral Yarnell has said, and he\u2019s been supported by most military authority, these islands that we\u2019re now talking about are not worth the bones of a single American soldier; and I know how difficult it is to sustain troops close to the shore under artillery bombardment.

His first statement was, \u201cBoth sides ought to show restraint.\u201d Again, a little bit of naivete there. He doesn\u2019t understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia. And Russia has now become a nation fueled by petro-dollars that is basically a KGB apparatchik-run government. I looked into Mr. Putin\u2019s eyes, and I saw three letters, a \u201cK,\u201d a \u201cG,\u201d and a \u201cB.\u201d And their aggression in Georgia is not acceptable behavior. I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to go back to the Cold War. I am sure that that will not happen. But I do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies. And that wasn\u2019t just about a problem between Georgia and Russia. It had everything to do with energy. There\u2019s a pipeline that runs from the Caspian through Georgia through Turkey. And, of course, we know that the Russians control other sources of energy into Europe, which they have used from time to time. It\u2019s not accidental that the presidents of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine flew to Georgia, flew to Tbilisi, where I have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, Misha Saakashvili. And they showed solidarity with them, but, also, they are very concerned about the Russian threats to regain their status of the old Russian to regain their status of the old Russian empire. Now, I think the Russians ought to understand that we will support \u2014 we, the United States \u2014 will support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in the natural process, inclusion into NATO. We also ought to make it very clear that the Russians are in violation of their cease-fire agreement. They have stationed additional troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. By the way, I went there once, and we went inside and drove in, and there was a huge poster. And this is \u2014 this is Georgian territory. And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin, and it said, \u201cVladimir Putin, our president.\u201d It was very clear, the Russian intentions towards Georgia.

Part of my tax package which is paid for in my balanced budget plan would exempt up to half a million dollars in gains from people when they sell their homes, which I think is the biggest capital gains benefit we could give to most ordinary Americans. We also have capital gains now for people that invest in new small businesses and hold the investment for five years. It was part of our other economic plan. And these are things I think that will go a long way toward helping America build a stronger economy and a better tax system. I think the most important thing to emphasize, though, is that we also have to help people in other ways to build a strong economy and we can\u2019t have any tax cut that\u2019s not paid for. One of the big differences between Senator Dole and myself is that I told you how I\u2019m going to pay for every penny of the tax cuts I recommend and we\u2019ve worked hard to bring this deficit down and that\u2019s helped people in the real estate business because the interest rates are lower. We\u2019ve got home ownership at a 15-year high. We\u2019ve got this country going in the right direction. So we can have a tax cut but my priority would be to help the families who need it with child rearing and education and buying a first-time home and helping for health care costs. So from your business, helping in buying a first-time home, exempting the capital gains on the sale of the home would be the most important things that you asked about. Thank you, Pamela."}

However, there were things added in in the House side that we felt made it less of a good bill; as a matter of fact, made it a bad bill. And in conference \u2014 we stayed with them in conference all the way to where even Senator Simpson did not want the bill in the manner in which it would come out of the conference committee. There were a number of things in there that weakened that bill. I can\u2019t go into detail about them here. But it is true our borders are out of control. It is also true that this has been a situation on our borders back through a number of administrations. And I supported this bill. I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though sometime back they may have entered illegally. With regard to the employer sanctions, we must have that not only to ensure that we can identify the illegal aliens, but also, while some keep protesting about what it would do to employers, there is another employer that we shouldn\u2019t be so concerned about, and these are employers down through the years who have encouraged the illegal entry into this country because they then hire these individuals and hire them at starvation wages and with none of the benefits that we think are normal and natural for workers in our country, and the individuals can\u2019t complain because of their illegal status. We don\u2019t think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free. And this was why the provisions that we had in with regard to sanctions, and so forth \u2014 and I\u2019m going to do everything I can, and all of us in the administration are, to join in again when Congress is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us, once again, control of our borders. And with regard to friendship below the border and with the countries down there, yes, no administration that I know has established the relationship that we have with our Latin friends. But as long as they have an economy that leaves so many people in dire poverty and unemployment, they are going to seek that employment across our borders. And we work with those other countries."}

I remember in the period immediately before the Korean War, South Korea was supposed to be indefensible as well. Generals testified to that. And Secretary Acheson made a very famous speech at the Press Club, early in the year that k- Korean War started, indicating in effect that South Korea was beyond the defense zone of the United States. I suppose it was hoped when he made that speech that we wouldn\u2019t get into a war. But it didn\u2019t mean that. We had to go in when they came in. Now I think as far as Quemoy and Matsu are concerned, that the question is not these two little pieces of real estate \u2013 they are unimportant. It isn\u2019t the few people who live on them \u2013 they are not too important. It\u2019s the principle involved. These two islands are in the area of freedom. The Nationalists have these two islands. We should not uh \u2013 force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists. If we do that we start a chain reaction; because the Communists aren\u2019t after Quemoy and Matsu, they\u2019re a- they\u2019re after Formosa. In my opinion this is the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for America in Korea. I am against it.

Uh \u2013 I obviously don\u2019t think it\u2019s valid. I have supported the Administration\u2019s position and I think that that position has been correct; I think my position has been correct. As far as Indochina was concerned, I stated over and over again that it was essential during that period that the United States make it clear that we would not tolerate Indochina falling under Communist domination. Now, as a result of our taking the strong stand that we did, the civil war there was ended; and today, at least in the south of Indochina, the Communists have moved out and we do have a strong, free bastion there. Now, looking to the U-2 flights, I would like to point out that I have been supporting the President\u2019s position throughout. I think the President was correct in ordering these flights. I think the President was correct, certainly, in his decision to continue the flights while the conference was going on. I noted, for example, in reading a \u2013 uh \u2013 a \u2013 a particular discussion that Senator Kennedy had with Dave Garroway shortly after the uh \u2013 his statement about regrets, that uh \u2013 he made the statement that he felt that these particular flights uh \u2013 were ones that shouldn\u2019t have occurred right at that time, and the indication was how would Mr. Khrushchev had felt if we had uh \u2013 had a flight over the uni- how would we have felt if Mr. Khrushchev ha \u2013 uh \u2013 had a flight over the United States while uh \u2013 he was visiting here. And the answer, of course, is that Communist espionage goes on all the time. The answer is that the United States can\u2019t afford to have a es- an es \u2013 a espionage lack or should we s- uh \u2013 lag \u2013 or should I say uh \u2013 an intelligence lag \u2013 any more than we can afford to have a missile lag. Now, referring to your question with regard to Quemoy and Matsu. What I object to here is the constant reference to surrendering these islands. Senator Kennedy quotes the record, which he read from a moment ago, but what he forgets to point out is that the key vote \u2013 a uh \u2013 vote which I\u2019ve referred to several times \u2013 where he was in the minority was one which rejected his position. Now, why did they reject it? For the very reason that those Senators knew, as the President of the United States knew, that you should not indicate to the Communists in advance that you\u2019re going to surrender an area that\u2019s free. Why? Because they know as Senator Kennedy will have to know that if you do that you encourage them to more aggression."}

Since this campaign began I have had a very rare privilege. I have traveled to forty-eight of the fifty states and in my travels I have learned what the people of the United States are thinking about. There is one issue that stands out above all the rest, one in which every American is concerned, regardless of what group he may be a member and regardless of where he may live. And that issue, very simply stated, is this: how can we keep the peace \u2013 keep it without surrender? How can we extend freedom \u2013 extend it without war? Now in determining how we deal with this issue, we must find the answer to a very important but simple question: who threatens the peace? Who threatens freedom in the world? There is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom \u2013 that that is presented by the international Communist movement. And therefore if we are to have peace, we must know how to deal with the Communists and their leaders. I know Mr. Khrushchev. I also have had the opportunity of knowing and meeting other Communist leaders in the world. I believe there are certain principles we must find in dealing with him and his colleagues \u2013 principles, if followed, that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom. First, we have to learn from the past, because we cannot afford to make the mistakes of the past. In the seven years before this Administration came into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain. And at the end of that seven years we were engaged in a war in Korea which cost of thirty thousand American lives. In the past seven years, in President Eisenhower\u2019s Administration, this situation has been reversed. We ended the Korean War; by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars; and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table. Now why were we successful, as our predecessors were not successful? I think there\u2019re several reasons. In the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the Communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world. One of the major errors they made was the one that led to the Korean War. In ruling out the defense of Korea, they invited aggression in that area. They thought they were going to have peace \u2013 it brought war. We learned from their mistakes. And so, in our seven years, we find that we have been firm in our diplomacy; we have never made concessions without getting concessions in return. We have always been willing to go the extra mile to negotiate for disarmament or in any other area. But we have never been willing to do anything that, in effect, surrendered freedom any place in the world. That is why President Eisenhower was correct in not apologizing or expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev at the Paris Conference, as Senator Kennedy suggested he could have done. That is why Senator wh- President Eisenhower was also correct in his policy in the Formosa Straits, where he declined, and refused to follow the recommendations \u2013 recommendations which Senator Kennedy voted for in 1955; again made in 1959; again repeated in his debates that you have heard \u2013 recommendations with regard to \u2013 again \u2013 slicing off a piece of free territory, and abandoning it, if \u2013 in effect, to the Communists. Why did the President feel this was wrong and why was the President right and his critics wrong? Because again this showed a lack of understanding of dictators, a lack of understanding particularly of Communists, because every time you make such a concession it does not lead to peace; it only encourages them to blackmail you. It encourages them to begin a war. And so I say that the record shows that we know how to keep the peace, to keep it without surrender. Let us move now to the future. It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical\u2026 leaders that the world has ever seen. That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area. First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have \u2013 if the should launch a surprise attack \u2013 we will be able to destroy their war-making capability. They must know, in other words, that it is national suicide if they begin anything. We need this kind of strength because we\u2019re the guardians of the peace. In addition to military strength, we need to see that the economy of this country continues to grow. It has grown in the past seven years. It can and will grow even more in the next four. And the reason that it must grow even more is because we have things to do at home and also because we\u2019re in a race for survival \u2013 a race in which it isn\u2019t enough to be ahead; it isn\u2019t enough simply to be complacent. We have to move ahead in order to stay ahead. And that is why, in this field, I have made recommendations which I am confident will move the American economy ahead \u2013 move it firmly and soundly so that there will never be a time when the Soviet Union will be able to challenge our superiority in this field. And so we need military strength, we need economic strength, we also need the right diplomatic policies. What are they? Again we turn to the past. Firmness but no belligerence, and by no belligerence I mean that we do not answer insult by insult. When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues. And that example that President Eisenhower has set we will continue to follow. But all this by itself is not enough. It is not enough for us simply to be the strongest nation militarily, the strongest economically, and also to have firm diplomacy. We must have a great goal. And that is: not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world, to extend it to all the world because that is America\u2019s destiny. To extend it to all the world because the Communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend Communism. And you cannot fight a victory for Communism or a strategy of victory for Communism with the strategy, simply of holding the line. And so I say that we believe that our policies of military strength, of economic strength, of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep it without surrender.

Uh \u2013 First of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference. This means at the secretary of state level and at the ambassadorial level. By adequate preparation I mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda, an agenda agreed upon with the approval of the heads of state involved. Now this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation. I don\u2019t believe we should go to a summit conference unless we have such an agenda, unless we have some reasonable insur- assurance from Mr. Khrushchev that he intends seriously to negotiate on those points. Now this may seem like a rigid, inflexible position. But let\u2019s look at the other side of the coin. If we build up the hopes of the world by having a summit conference that is not adequately prepared, and then, if Mr. Khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up \u2013 as he did this one \u2013 because he isn\u2019t going to get his way \u2013 we\u2019d set back the cause of peace. We do not help it. We can, in other words, negotiate many of these items of difference between us without going to the summit. I think we have to make a greater effort than we have been making at the secretary of state level, at the ambassadorial level, to work out the differences that we have. And so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit \u2013 a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it is. When I say \u201cphony spirit,\u201d I mean phony, not because the spirit is not good on our side, but because the Soviet Union simply doesn\u2019t intend to carry out what they say. Now, these are the conditions that I can lay out. I cannot be more precise than that, because until we see what Mr. Khrushchev does and what he says uh \u2013 we cannot indicate what our plans will be."}

And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes. Let\u2019s talk about corporate taxes. Now, I\u2019ve identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually help the economy. The oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare. Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don\u2019t get. Now, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money, when they\u2019re making money every time you go to the pump? Why wouldn\u2019t we want to eliminate that? Why wouldn\u2019t we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets? My attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it. When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue neutral way, close loopholes, deductions \u2014 he hasn\u2019t identified which ones they are \u2014 but that thereby bring down the corporate rate. Well, I want to do the same thing, but I\u2019ve actually identified how we can do that. And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas. Right now, you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas. I think most Americans would say that doesn\u2019t make sense. And all that raises revenue. And so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college. It means that the teacher that I met in Las Vegas, a wonderful young lady, who describes to me \u2014 she\u2019s got 42 kids in her class. The first two weeks she\u2019s got them, some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned. They\u2019re using text books that are 10 years old. That is not a recipe for growth. That\u2019s not how America was built. And so budgets reflect choices. Ultimately, we\u2019re going to have to make some decisions. And if we\u2019re asking for no revenue, then that means that we\u2019ve got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff. And the magnitude of the tax cuts that you\u2019re talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow. As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we\u2019re talking about potentially a 30 \u2014 a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time. Now, you know, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is, you know, numbers on a sheet of paper, but if we\u2019re talking about a family who\u2019s got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid, that\u2019s a big problem. And governors are creative. There\u2019s no doubt about it. But they\u2019re not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid. What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help."}

And, in fact, if in fact it blows up and the wrong people gain control, it\u2019s going to have impact on the entire region causing potentially regional wars. We are working hand and glove with the Turks, with the Jordanians, with the Saudis, and with all the people in the region attempting to identify the people who deserve the help so that when Assad goes \u2014 and he will go \u2014 there will be a legitimate government that follows on, not an Al Qaida-sponsored government that follows on. And all this loose talk of my friend, Governor Romney, and the congressman, about how we\u2019re going to do, we could do so much more in there, what more would they do other than put American boots on the ground? The last thing America needs is to get in another ground war in the Middle East, requiring tens of thousands, if not well over 100,000 American forces. That \u2014 they are the facts. They are the facts. Now, every time the governor is asked about this, he doesn\u2019t say anything. He \u2014 he goes up with a whole lot of verbiage, but when he gets pressed he says, no, he would not do anything different than we are doing now.

He knew these flights were going on long before and that wasn\u2019t the reason that he broke up the conference. Second, he\u2019s wrong in the analogies that he makes. The United States is a strong country. Whenever we do anything that\u2019s wrong, we can express regrets. But when the president of the United States is doing something that\u2019s right, something that is for the purpose of defending the security of this country against surprise attack, he can never express regrets or apologize to anybody, including Mr. Khrushchev. Now in that connection Senator Kennedy has criticized the President on the ground not only of not expressing regrets, but because he allowed this flight to take place while the summit conference \u2013 or immediately before the summit conference occurred. This seems to me is criticism that again is wrong on his part. We all remember Pearl Harbor. We lost three thousand American lives. We cannot afford an intelligence gap. And I just want to make my position absolutely clear with regard to getting intelligence information. I don\u2019t intend to see to it that the United States is ever in a position where, while we\u2019re negotiating with the Soviet Union, that we discontinue our intelligence effort. And I don\u2019t intend ever to express regrets to Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else if I\u2019m doing something that has the support of the Congress and that is right for the purpose of protecting the security of the United States."}

We have been wholly indifferent to Latin America until the last few months. The program that was put forward this summer, after we broke off the sugar quota with Cuba, really was done because we wanted to get through the O.A.S. meeting a condemnation of Russian infiltration of Cuba. And therefore we passed an authorization \u2013 not an aid bill \u2013 which was the first time, really, since the Inter-American Bank which was founded a year ago was developed, that we really have looked at the needs of Latin America; that we have associated ourselves with those people. Secondly, I believe that in the ca- that it\u2019s far better for the United States, instead of concentrating our aid, particularly in the underdeveloped world, on surplus military equipment \u2013 we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into Laos. We paid more military aid, more aid into Laos po- per \u2013 per person than in any country in the world and we ought to know now that Laos is moving from neutralism in the direction of the Communists. I believe instead of doing that, we should concentrate our aid in long-term loans which these people can pay back either in hard money or in local currency. This permits them to maintain their self-respect. It permits us to make sure that the projects which are invested in are going to produce greater wealth. And I believe that in cases of India and Africa and Latin America that this is where our emphasis should be. I would strengthen the Development Loan Fund. And Senator Fulbright, Senator Humphrey and I tried to do that. We tried to provide an appropriation of a billion and a half for five years, on a long-term loan basis, which this Administration opposed. And unless we\u2019re ready to carry out programs like that in the sixties, this battle for economic survival which these people are waging are going to be lost. And if India should lose her battle, with thirty-five per cent of the people of the underdeveloped world within her borders, then I believe that the balance of power could move against us. I think the United States can afford to do these things. I think that we could not afford not to do these things. This goes to our survival. And here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if it\u2019s developing its economy to the fullest \u2013 which we are not now \u2013 in my judgment, we\u2019ll have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas. I believe it\u2019s essential that we do it because in the next ten years the balance of power is going to begin to move in the world from one direction or another \u2013 towards us or towards the Communists \u2013 and unless we begin to identify ourselves not only with the anti-Communist fight, but also with the fight against poverty and hunger, these people are going to begin to turn to the Communists as an example. I believe we can do it. If we build our economy the way we should, we can afford to do these things and we must do it."}

I am going to make a major speech on this whole subject next week before the next debate, and I will have an opportunity then to answer any other questions that may arise with regard to my position on it. There isn\u2019t any question but that we must move forward in every possible way to reduce the danger of war; to move toward controlled disarmament; to control tests; but also let\u2019s have in mind this: when Senator Kennedy suggests that we haven\u2019t been making an effort, he simply doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. It isn\u2019t a question of the number of people who are working in an Administration. It\u2019s a question of who they are. This has been one of the highest level operations in the whole State Department right under the President himself. We have gone certainly the extra mile and then some in making offers to the Soviet Union on control of tests, on disarmament, and in every other way. And I just want to make one thing very clear. Yes, we should make a great effort. But under no circumstances must the United States ever make an agreement based on trust. There must be an absolute guarantee. Now, just a comment on Senator Kennedy\u2019s last answer. He forgets that in this same debate on the Formosa resolution, which he said he voted for \u2013 which he did \u2013 that he voted against an amendment, or was recorded against an amendment \u2013 and on this particular \u2013 or for an amendment, I should say \u2013 which passed the Senate overwhelmingly, seventy to twelve. And that amendment put the Senate of the United States on record with a majority of the Senator\u2019s own party voting for it, as well as the majority of Republicans \u2013 put them on record \u2013 against the very position that the Senator takes now of surrendering, of indicating in advance, that the United States will not defend the offshore islands."}

And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left. And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime. Russia hasn\u2019t paid any attention to ISIS. They\u2019re interested in keeping Assad in power. So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones. We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them. And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground. But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia. Russia has decided that it\u2019s all in, in Syria. And they\u2019ve also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it\u2019s not me. I\u2019ve stood up to Russia. I\u2019ve taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president. I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that\u2019s fine. And I did as secretary of state. That\u2019s how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons. It\u2019s how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now. But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable."}

I\u2019ve got no illusions about that. And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters.

First time I was there in 2002, it was amazing to me what they were facing. When I went to the Ahgandah (ph) Valley in Kandahar before the surge, I sat down with a young private in the 82nd from the Monamanee (ph) Indian reservation who would tell me what he did every day, and I was in awe. And to see what they had in front of them. And then to go back there in December, to go throughout Helmand with the Marines, to see what they had accomplished, it\u2019s nothing short of amazing. What we don\u2019t want to do is lose the gains we\u2019ve gotten. Now, we\u2019ve disagreed from time to time on a few issues.

We\u2019ve been skeptical about negotiations with the Taliban, especially while they\u2019re shooting at us.

That would break the auto industry and throw a lot of people out of work. As regarding Mr. Perot, I take back something I said about him. I once said, in a frivolous moment, when he got out of the race - If you can\u2019t stand the heat, buy an air conditioning company. And I take it back, because I think \u2014 he said he made a mistake. And the thing I find is if I make a mistake, I admit it. I\u2019ve never heard Governor Clinton make a mistake. But one mistake he\u2019s made is fuel efficiency standards at 40 to 45 miles a gallon will throw many auto workers out of work, and you can\u2019t have it both ways.

Uh \u2013 I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh \u2013 pay teachers\u2019 salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers\u2019 salaries \u2013 at least that\u2019s the way I read his remarks. Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers\u2019 salaries? Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then? Why do I take it now? We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers\u2019 salaries. We need higher teachers\u2019 salaries. But we also want our education to be free of federal control. When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach. I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession. There is another point that should be made. I favor higher salaries for teachers. But, as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference, the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction, which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers\u2019 salaries. I should also point out this; once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers\u2019 salaries, your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should. I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility. Teachers\u2019 salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries. This is not enough; it should be more. But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program. My objection here is not the cost in dollars. My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have."}

The question of Communism within the United States has been one that has worried us in the past. It is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come. We have to remember that the cold war that Mr. Khrushchev is waging and his colleagues are waging, is waged all over the world and it\u2019s waged right here in the United States. That\u2019s why we have to continue to be alert. It is also essential in being alert that we be fair; fair because by being fair we uphold the very freedoms that the Communists would destroy. We uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow. And, in this connection, I think that uh \u2013 we must look to the future having in mind the fact that we fight Communism at home not only by our laws to deal with Communists uh \u2013 the few who do become Communists and the few who do become tra- fellow travelers, but we also fight Communism at home by moving against those various injustices which exist in our society which the Communists feed upon. And in that connection I again would say that while Senator Kennedy says we are for the status quo, I do believe that he uh \u2013 would agree that I am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education, my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his. The question again is not one of goals \u2013 we\u2019re for those goals \u2013 it\u2019s one of means."}

The question is what we\u2019re going to do in the future. I\u2019ve been critical of this Administration and I\u2019ve been critical of the President. In fact uh \u2013 Mr. Nixon uh \u2013 discussed that a week ago in a speech. I believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined. Now what is the issue is what we\u2019re going to do in the future. Now that\u2019s an issue between Mr. Nixon and myself. He feels that we\u2019re moving ahead uh \u2013 in a \u2013 we\u2019re not going into a recession in this country, economically; he feels that our power and prestige is stronger than it ever was relative to that of the Communists, that we\u2019re moving ahead. I disagree. And I believe the American people have to make the choice on November eighth between the view of whether we have to move ahead faster, whether what we\u2019re doing now is not satisfactory, whether we have to build greater strength at home and abroad and Mr. Nixon\u2019s view. That\u2019s the great issue. President Eisenhower moves from the scene on January twentieth and the next four years are the critical years. And that\u2019s the debate. That\u2019s the argument between Mr. Nixon and myself and on that issue the American people have to make their judgment and I think it\u2019s a important judgment. I think in many ways this election is more important than any since 1932, or certainly almost any in this century. Because we disagree very fundamentally on the position of the United States, and if his view prevails then I think that\u2019s going to bring an important result to this country in the sixties. If our view prevails that we have to do more, that we have to make a greater national and international effort, that we have lost prestige in Latin America \u2013 the President of Brazil \u2013 the new incumbent running for office called on Castro during his campaign because he thought it was important to get the vote of those who were supporting Castro in Latin America. In Africa, the United States has ignored Latin uh \u2013 Africa. We gave more scholarships to the Congo \u2013 this summer we offered them \u2013 than we\u2019ve given to all of Africa the year before. Less than two hundred for all the countries of Africa and they need trained leadership more than anything. We\u2019ve been uh \u2013 having a very clear decision in the last eight years. Mr. Nixon has been part of that Administration. He\u2019s had experience in it. And I believe this Administration has not met its responsibilities in the last eight years, that our power relative to that of the Communists is declining, that we\u2019re facing a very hazardous time in the sixties, and unless the United States begin to move here \u2013 unless we start to go ahead \u2013 I don\u2019t believe that we\u2019re going to meet our responsibility to our own people or to the cause of freedom. I think the choice is clear and it involves the future."}

There were too many infantrymen there, not enough heavy artillery; and certainly I don\u2019t think there was any implication in Secretary Dulles\u2019 statement that Quemoy and Matsu should not be defended in the event that they were attacked, and that attack was a preliminary to an attack on Formosa. Now as far as President Eisenhower is concerned, I have often heard him discuss this question. As I uh \u2013 related a moment ago, the President has always indicated that we must not make the mistake in dealing with the dictator of indicating that we are going to make a concession at the point of a gun. Whenever you do that, inevitably the dictator is encouraged to try it again. So first it will be Quemoy and Matsu, next it may be Formosa. What do we do then? My point is this: that once you do this \u2013 follow this course of action \u2013 of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return. And that means war. We went through this tragic experience leading to World War II. We learned our lesson again in Korea, We must not learn it again. That is why I think the Senate was right, including a majority of the Democrats, a majority of the Republicans, when they rejected Senator Kennedy\u2019s position in 1955. And incidentally, Senator Johnson was among those who rejected that position \u2013 voted with the seventy against the twelve. The Senate was right because they knew the lesson of history. And may I say, too, that I would trust that Senator Kennedy would change his position on this \u2013 change it; because as long as he as a major presidential candidate continues to suggest that we are going to turn over these islands, he is only encouraging the aggressors \u2013 the Chinese Communist and the Soviet aggressors \u2013 to press the United States, to press us to the point where war would be inevitable. The road to war is always paved with good intentions. And in this instance the good intentions, of course, are a desire for peace. But certainly we\u2019re not going to have peace by giving in and indicating in advance that we are not going to defend what has become a symbol of freedom."}

And the significance of prestige, really, is because we\u2019re so identified with the cause of freedom. Therefore, if we are on the mount, if we are rising, if our influence is spreading, if our prestige is spreading, then those uh \u2013 who stand now on the razor edge of decision between us or between the Communist system, wondering whether they should use the system of freedom to develop their countries or the system of Communism, they\u2019ll be persuaded to follow our example. There have been several indications that our prestige is not as high as it once was. Mr. George Allen, the head of our information service, said that a result of our being second in space, in the sputnik in 1957, and I quote him, I believe I paraphrase him accurately. He said that many of these countries equate space developments with scientific productivity and scientific advancement. And therefore, he said, many of these countries now feel that the Soviet Union, which was once so backward, is now on a par with the United States. Secondly, the economic growth of the Soviet Union is greater than ours. Mr. Dulles has suggested it\u2019s from two to three times as great as ours. This has a great effect on the s- underdeveloped world, which faces problems of low income and high population density and inadequate resources. Three, a Gallup Poll taken in February asked people in ten countries which country they thought would be first in 1970, both scientifically and militarily. And a majority in every country except Greece, felt that it would be the Soviet Union by l970. Four, in the votes at the U.N., particularly the vote dealing with Red China last Saturday, we received the support on the position that we had taken of only two African countries \u2013 one, Liberia, which had been tied to us for more than a century, and the other, Union of South Africa, which is not a popular country in Africa. Every other ca- African country either abstained or voted against us. A \u2013 More countries voted against us in Asia on this issue than voted with us. On the neutralists\u2019 resolution, which we were so much opposed to, the same thing happened. The candidate who was a candidate for the president of Brazil, took a trip to Cuba to call on Mr. Castro during the election in order to get the benefit of the Castro supporters uh \u2013 within Brazil. There are many indications. Guinea and Ghana, two independent countries within the last three years \u2013 Guinea in fifty-seven, Ghana within the last eighteen months \u2013 both now are supporting the Soviet foreign policy at the U.N. Mr. Herter said so himself. Laos is moving in that direction. So I would say our prestige is not so high. No longer do we give the image of being on the rise. No longer do we give an image of vitality."}

Now, in this connection I want to point out that the facts simply aren\u2019t as stated. First of all, the report to which Senator Kennedy refers is one that was made many, many months ago and related particularly to the uh \u2013 period immediately after Sputnik. Second, as far as this report is concerned, I would have no objection to having it made public. Third, I would say this with regard to this report, with regard to Gallup Polls of prestige abroad and everything else that we\u2019ve been hearing about \u201cwhat about American prestige abroad\u201d: America\u2019s prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for America allow it to be. Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example \u2013 Senator Kennedy \u2013 stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight \u2013 we\u2019ve had twenty-eight successful shots, they\u2019ve had eight; when he states that we\u2019re second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I\u2019ve seen ours, and we\u2019re not; that we\u2019re second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we\u2019re way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige? Well, it can only have the effect certainly of reducing it. Well let me make one thing clear. Senator Kennedy has a responsibility to criticize those things that are wrong, but he has also a responsibility to be right in his criticism. Every one of these items that I have mentioned he\u2019s been wrong \u2013 dead wrong. And for that reason he has contributed to any lack of prestige. Finally, let me say this: as far as prestige is concerned, the first place it would show up would be in the United Nations. Now Senator Kennedy has referred to the vote on Communist China. Let\u2019s look at the vote on Hungary. There we got more votes for condemning Hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year. Let\u2019s look at the reaction eh \u2013 reaction to Khrushchev and Eisenhower at the last U.N. session. Did Khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted? Not at all. The President gained. America gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it\u2019s that that keeps the prestige of America up, not running down America the way Senator Kennedy has been running her down."}

Because there has been nobody tougher to Russia. Between the sanctions, nobody tougher than me on Russia. Between the sanctions between all of what I\u2019ve done with NATO. You know, I\u2019ve got the NATO countries to put up an extra 130 billion, going to $420 billion a year, that\u2019s to guard against Russia. I sold \u2014 while he was selling pillows and sheets \u2014 I sold tank busters to Ukraine. There has been nobody tougher on Russia than Donald Trump. And I\u2019ll tell you, they were so bad. They took over the, the submarine port. You remember that very well during your term, during you and Barack Obama. They took over a big part of what should have been Ukraine. You handed it to them. But you were getting a lot of money from Russia. They were paying you a lot of money and they probably still are, but now, with what came out today, it\u2019s even worse. All of the emails, the emails are horrible. The emails of the kind of money that you were raking in, you and your family. And Joe, you were vice president when some of this was happening. And it should have never happened. And I think you owe an explanation to the American people. Why is it, somebody just had a news conference a little while ago, who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family, but what he said was damning.

Hillary Clinton\u2019s top priority when she became secretary of state was the Russian reset, the Russian reset. After the Russian reset, the Russians invaded Ukraine and took over Crimea. And the small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States to the point where all the United States of America \u2014 the greatest nation on Earth \u2014 just withdraws from talks about a cease-fire while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria while he marshals the forces and begins \u2014 look, we have got to begin to lean into this with strong, broad-shouldered American leadership.

We have the lowest number of troops since the end of the Second World War. We\u2019ve got to work with the Congress, and Donald Trump will, to rebuild our military and project American strength in the world.

And secondly, I just have to tell you that the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength. And if Russia chooses to be involved and continue, I should say, to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo.

It rejects the notion of perpetual global struggle, advocating instead for collaborative global governance, where the U.S. is one among many equal contributors to global peace and stability.\n5. **Rejection of National Exceptionalism**: Rather than asserting American exceptionalism, this ideology favors a multipolar world where no single country is seen as the \u201cnatural leader.\u201d It rejects the notion of inherent U.S. superiority, advocating for respectful partnerships with other nations and acknowledging the value of diverse political, economic, and cultural systems.\n6. **Proactive Peace and Conflict Prevention**: This belief system values proactive peace efforts and conflict prevention rather than reactive, crisis-driven interventions. It promotes investment in early conflict resolution, sustainable development, and addressing systemic inequalities that often lead to crises, seeing these as more effective than reactionary military or diplomatic interventions.\n7. **Global Non-Interventionism and Domestic Prioritization**: Emphasizing non-interventionism, this ideology opposes selective intervention and argues that the U.S. should focus on addressing domestic issues rather than involving itself in foreign conflicts. It holds that stability abroad is best achieved when nations address their own challenges autonomously, free from external influence.\n8. **Cultural Relativism and Global Pluralism**: Instead of a moral imperative to spread American values, this perspective advocates for cultural relativism, accepting that freedom and democracy may look different in different societies.

It opposes the idea that personal morality or traditional values should guide policy on issues like gun control or drug use, focusing instead on harm reduction and social inclusivity without moral judgments.\n7. **Caution on Technological Surveillance and Data Use**: In contrast to advocating for high-tech tools like automated background checks, this view is cautious about surveillance technology, emphasizing privacy rights and the potential for misuse of data.

I live in a state where over half the adults have hunting or fishing licenses, or both. But I believe we have to have some way of checking hand guns before they\u2019re sold, to check the criminal history, the mental health history, and the age of people who are buying them. Therefore I support the Brady bill which would impose a national waiting period unless and until a state did what only Virginia has done now, which is to automate its records. Once you automate your records, then you don\u2019t have to have a waiting period, but at least you can check. I also think we should have frankly restrictions on assault weapons whose only purpose is to kill. We need to give the police a fighting chance in our urban areas where the gangs are building up. The third thing I would say \u2014 it doesn\u2019t bear directly on gun control, but it\u2019s very important \u2014 we need more police on the street. There is a crime bill which would put more police on the street, which was killed for this session by a filibuster in the Senate, mostly be Republican senators, and I think it\u2019s a shame it didn\u2019t pass, I think it should be made the law \u2014 but it had the Brady bill in it, the waiting period. I also believe that we should offer college scholarships to people who will agree to work them off as police officers, and I think, as we reduce our military forces, we should let people earn military retirement by coming out and working as police officers. Thirty years ago there were three police officers on the street for every crime; today there are three crimes for every police officer. In the communities which have had real success putting police officers near schools where kids carry weapons, to get the weapons out of the schools, are on the same blocks, you\u2019ve seen crime go down. In Houston there\u2019s been a 15- percent drop in the crime rate in the last year because of the work the mayor did there in increasing the police force.

I am a hunter. I\u2019m a gun owner. I\u2019ve been a hunter since I was a kid, 12, 13 years old. And I respect the Second Amendment and I will not tamper with the Second Amendment. But I\u2019ll tell you this. I\u2019m also a former law enforcement officer. I ran one of the largest district attorney\u2019s offices in America, one of the ten largest. I put people behind bars for the rest of their life. I\u2019ve broken up organized crime. I know something about prosecuting. And most of the law enforcement agencies in America wanted that assault weapons ban. They don\u2019t want to go into a drug bust and be facing an AK-47. I was hunting in Iowa last year with a sheriff from one of the counties there, and he pointed to a house in back of us, and said, \u201cSee the house over? We just did a drug bust a week earlier, and the guy we arrested had an AK-47 lying on the bed right beside him. \u201c Because of the president\u2019s decision today, law enforcement officers will walk into a place that will be more dangerous. Terrorists can now come into America and go to a gun show and, without even a background check, buy an assault weapon today. And that\u2019s what Osama bin Laden\u2019s handbook said, because we captured it in Afghanistan. It encouraged them to do it. So I believe America\u2019s less safe.

States like Florida, Colorado, Virginia, and other states. You don\u2019t buy any gun. You don\u2019t get any gun. We\u2019ve got 20 million names on a computer in Washington, D.C. of people who should not have guns. We ought to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. And, there are eight other categories that should not have guns. I\u2019ve been working on this for a long, long time. You walk in, you put your little card in there.

If we\u2019re going to protect American children and American families and people who live as prisoners in their own home, we\u2019ve got to stop guns from being dumped on the street.

In our administration, in my administration, we will expedite. This keeps up with technology. It keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have guns. That is the bottom line.

I think we put a lot on police shoulders. And this is something I got a lot of scar tissue and experience on. I was a city councilman and mayor in Richmond. And when I came in, we had one of the highest homicide rates in the United States. We fought very, very hard over the course of my time in local office with our police department, and we reduced our homicide rate nearly in half. And then when I was governor of Virginia, we worked hard, too. And we did something we had really wanted to do. For the first time ever, we cracked the top 10, 10 safest states, because we worked together. Here\u2019s what I learned as a mayor and a governor. The way you make communities safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing. You build the bonds between the community and the police force, build bonds of understanding, and then when people feel comfortable in their communities, that gap between the police and the communities they serve narrows. And when that gap narrows, it\u2019s safer for the communities and it\u2019s safer for the police. That model still works across our country, but there are some other models that don\u2019t work, an overly aggressive, more militarized model. Donald Trump recently said we need to do more stop-and-frisk around the country. That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community. So here\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. We\u2019ll focus on community policing. We will focus on \u2014 and Hillary Clinton has rolled out a really comprehensive mental health reform package that she worked on with law enforcement professionals, and we will also fight the scourge of gun violence in the United States. I\u2019m a gun-owner. I\u2019m a strong Second Amendment supporter. But I\u2019ve got a lot of scar tissue, because when I was governor of Virginia, there was a horrible shooting at Virginia Tech, and we learned that through that painful situation that gaps in the background record check system should have been closed and it could have prevented that crime, and so we\u2019re going to work to do things like close background record checks. And if we do, we won\u2019t have the tragedies that we did. One of those killed at Virginia Tech was a guy named Liviu Librescu. He was a 70-plus-year-old Romanian Holocaust survivor. He had survived the Holocaust. Then he survived the Soviet Union takeover of his country.

I am. But let\u2019s look at the overall record. Overall in America cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years, casual drug use down 13 percent. The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it. Let me tell you what I tried to do about it. I appointed a four-star general who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country as our nation\u2019s drug czar. The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired. We submitted the biggest drug budget ever. We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border. We supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including, including the death penalty for drug kingpins. And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug-free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all those things were very important. Do I think that I bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still don\u2019t understand drugs are wrong, drugs can kill you. Even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them. I think we all do. And I hope we can do better. I don\u2019t think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I don\u2019t think Senator Dole supports using using drugs. I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn\u2019t dangerous and won\u2019t kill them and won\u2019t destroy their lives, get the message and change."}

The record just doesn\u2019t prove that such legislation or action by a local city council is effective. What we have to do, and this is the crux of the matter, is to make it very, very uh \u2013 difficult for a person who uses a gun in the commission of a crime to stay out of jail. If we make the use of a gun in the commission. of a crime a serious criminal offense, and that person is prosecuted, then, in my opinion, we are going after the person who uses the gun for the wrong reason. I don\u2019t believe in the registration of handguns or the registration of the handgun owner. That has not proven to be effective, and therefore, I think the better way is to go after the criminal, the individual who commits a crime in the possession of a gun and uses that gun for a part of his criminal activity. Those are the people who ought to be in jail. And the only way to do it is to pass strong legislation so that once apprehended, indicted, convicted, they\u2019ll be in jail and off the streets and not using guns in the commission of a crime."}

When you say loud and clear to somebody if you\u2019re going to carry a gun illegally, we\u2019re going to arrest you. If you\u2019re going to sell a gun illegally, you need to be arrested. If you commit a crime with a gun, there needs to be absolute certainty in the law. And that means that the local law enforcement officials need help at the federal level. Programs like Project Exile where the federal government intensifies arresting people who illegally use guns. And we haven\u2019t done a very good job of that at the federal level recently. And I\u2019m going to make it a priority. Secondly, I don\u2019t think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldn\u2019t have them. That\u2019s why I support instant background checks at gun shows. One of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not. In Texas I tried to do something innovative. There\u2019s a lot of talk about trigger locks being on guns sold in the future. I support that. But I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come and get one for free. So we\u2019re distributing in our State of Texas for free. I think we ought to raise the age at which a juvenile can carry a handgun from 18 to 21. I disagree with the vice president on this issue. He is for registration of guns. I think the only people that are going to show up to register or get a license \u2014 I guess licensing like a driver\u2019s license for a gun, the only people that are going to show up are law-abiding citizens.

Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they\u2019re treated in the criminal justice system. We\u2019ve just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte. And we\u2019ve got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police. We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they\u2019re well prepared to use force only when necessary. Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law. Right now, that\u2019s not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods. So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform. I\u2019ve laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system. But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform. So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. And we\u2019ve got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together. So we have to do two things, as I said. We have to restore trust. We have to work with the police. We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them. And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we\u2019re seeing today."}

We\u2019ve got a long tradition of hunting and sportsmen and people who want to make sure they can protect themselves. But there have been too many instances during the course of my presidency, where I\u2019ve had to comfort families who have lost somebody. Most recently out in Aurora. You know, just a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably about a month, I saw a mother, who I had met at the bedside of her son, who had been shot in that theater. And her son had been shot through the head. And we spent some time, and we said a prayer and, remarkably, about two months later, this young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable, good as new. But there were a lot of families who didn\u2019t have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands didn\u2019t survive. So my belief is that, (A), we have to enforce the laws we\u2019ve already got, make sure that we\u2019re keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill. We\u2019ve done a much better job in terms of background checks, but we\u2019ve got more to do when it comes to enforcement. But I also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters don\u2019t belong on our streets. And so what I\u2019m trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally. Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced. But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence. Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there\u2019s an awful lot of violence and they\u2019re not using AK-47s. They\u2019re using cheap hand guns. And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that our schools are working; that if there\u2019s violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control. And so what I want is a \u2014 is a comprehensive strategy. Part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. But part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur."}

And it\u2019s just a fact that if you\u2019re a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated. So we\u2019ve got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. We cannot just say law and order. We have to say\u2014we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little. We need to have more second chance programs. I\u2019m glad that we\u2019re ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system. You shouldn\u2019t have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans. So there are some positive ways we can work on this. And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us. Right now\u2014and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby\u2014right now, we\u2019ve got too many military-style weapons on the streets. In a lot of places, our police are outgunned. We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm. And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who\u2019s on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country. If you\u2019re too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way."}

With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it\u2019s a problem of the Constitution. I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us. And I think that this is what we should concentrate on, is trying \u2014 I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee, there were medical authorities, there were religious \u2014 there were clerics there \u2014 everyone talking about this matter of prolife. And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive. We have seen premature births that are now grown-up, happy people going around. Also, there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life. In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor \u2014 signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder. Now, isn\u2019t it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child, and it was abortion and not murder, but if somebody else does it, that\u2019s murder? And it used the term \u201cdeath of the unborn child.\u201d So, this has been my feeling about abortion, that we have a problem now to determine \u2014 and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being."}

He was my hero when I was growing up. And we\u2019d go up to visit my dad\u2019s family in Chicago. My three brothers and I would marvel at my uncle when he would come out in his uniform, sidearm at his side. Police officers are the best of us. And the men and women, white, African-American, Asian, Latino, Hispanic, they put their lives on the line every single day. And let me say, at the risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea. It\u2019s worked in the Hoosier state. And we fully support that. Donald Trump and I are going to make sure that law enforcement have the resources and the tools to be able to really restore law and order to the cities and communities in this nation. It\u2019s probably \u2014 probably why the 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States of America, because they see his commitment to them.

And that really has got to stop. I mean, when an African-American police officer in Charlotte named Brentley Vinson, an all-star football player who went to Liberty University here in the state, came home, followed his dad into law enforcement, joined the force in Charlotte, joined the force in Charlotte in 2014, was involved in a police action shooting that claimed the life of Keith \u2014 Keith Lamont Scott, it was a tragedy. I mean, I \u2014 we \u2014 we mourn with those who mourn. We \u2014 we grieve with those who grieve. And we\u2019re saddened at the loss of life. But Hillary Clinton actually referred to that moment as an example of implicit bias in the police force, where \u2014 where she used \u2014 when she was asked in the debate a week ago whether there was implicit bias in law enforcement, her only answer was that there\u2019s implicit bias in everyone in the United States.

Our faith informs us in everything we do. My faith informs me about how to take care of the vulnerable, of how to make sure that people have a chance in life. Now, you want to ask basically why I\u2019m pro-life? It\u2019s not simply because of my Catholic faith. That\u2019s a factor, of course. But it\u2019s also because of reason and science. You know, I think about 10 1\/2 years ago, my wife Janna and I went to Mercy Hospital in Janesville where I was born, for our seven week ultrasound for our firstborn child, and we saw that heartbeat. A little baby was in the shape of a bean. And to this day, we have nicknamed our firstborn child Liza, \u201cBean.\u201d Now I believe that life begins at conception. That\u2019s why \u2014 those are the reasons why I\u2019m pro-life. Now I understand this is a difficult issue, and I respect people who don\u2019t agree with me on this, but the policy of a Romney administration will be to oppose abortions with the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. What troubles me more is how this administration has handled all of these issues. Look at what they\u2019re doing through Obamacare with respect to assaulting the religious liberties of this country. They\u2019re infringing upon our first freedom, the freedom of religion, by infringing on Catholic charities, Catholic churches, Catholic hospitals. Our church should not have to sue our federal government to maintain their religious liberties. And with respect to abortion, the Democratic Party used to say they wanted it to be safe, legal and rare. Now they support it without restriction and with taxpayer funding. Taxpayer funding in Obamacare, taxpayer funding with foreign aid. The vice president himself went to China and said that he sympathized and wouldn\u2019t second guess their one child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations. That to me is pretty extreme."}

I want to thank President Reagan for agreeing to debate. He didn\u2019t have to, and he did, and we all appreciate it. The President\u2019s favorite question is: Are you better off? Well, if you\u2019re wealthy, you\u2019re better off. If you\u2019re middle income, you\u2019re about where you were. And if you\u2019re modest income, you\u2019re worse off. That\u2019s what the economists tell us. But is that really the question that should be asked? Isn\u2019t the real question is will we be better off? Will our children be better off? Are we building the future that this nation needs? I believe that if we ask those questions that bear on our future, not just congratulate ourselves but challenge us to solve those problems, you\u2019ll see that we need new leadership. Are we better of with this arms race? Will we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens? Are we better off when we deemphasize our values in human rights? Are we better off when we load our children with this fantastic debt? Would fathers and mothers feel proud of themselves if they loaded their children with debts like this nation is now \u2014 over a trillion dollars on the shoulders of our children? Can we say, really say that we will be better off when we pull away from sort of that basic American instinct of decency and fairness? I would rather lose a campaign about decency than win a campaign about self-interest. I don\u2019t think this nation is composed of people who care only for themselves. And when we sought to assault Social Security and Medicare, as the record shows we did, I think that was mean-spirited. When we terminated 400,000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability \u2014 confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for 4 years, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what America is all about. America is a fair society, and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him. I believe there\u2019s fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system. I believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment. And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful. These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price. That\u2019s not fair for our future. I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training, because this world is more complex and we\u2019re being pressed harder all the time. I believe in opening doors. We won the Olympics, in part, because we\u2019ve had civil rights laws and the laws that prohibit discrimination against women. I have been for those efforts all my life. The President\u2019s record is quite different. The question is our future. President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, \u201cWe are great, but we can be greater.\u201d We can be better if we face our future, rejoice in our strengths, face our problems, and by solving them, build a better society for our children. Thank you."}

I talk about strengthening the American family and it\u2019s very hard to strengthen the family if people are scared to walk down to the corner store and, you know, send their kid down to get a loaf of bread. It\u2019s very hard. I have been fighting for very strong anti-crime legislation \u2014 habeas corpus reform, so you don\u2019t have these endless appeals, so when somebody gets sentenced, hey, this is for real. I\u2019ve been fighting for changes in the exclusionary rule so if an honest cop stops somebody and makes a technical mistake, the criminal doesn\u2019t go away. I\u2019ll probably get into a fight in this room with some but I happen to think that we need stronger death penalties for those that kill police officers. Virginia\u2019s in the lead in this, as Governor Clinton properly said, on this identification system for firearms. I am not for national registration of firearms. Some of the states that have the toughest anti-gun laws have the highest levels of crime. I am for the right, as the governor says- -I\u2019m a sportsman and I don\u2019t think you ought to eliminate all kinds of weapons. But I was not for the bill that he was talking about because it was not tough enough on the criminal. I\u2019m very pleased that the Fraternal Order of Police in Little Rock, Arkansas endorsed me because I think they see I\u2019m trying to strengthen the anti-crime legislation. We\u2019ve got more money going out for local police than any previous administration. So we\u2019ve got to get it under control and there\u2019s one last point I\u2019d make. Drugs. We have got to win our national strategy against drugs, the fight against drugs. And we\u2019re making some progress, doing a little better on interdiction. We\u2019re not doing as well amongst the people that get to be habitual drug-users. The good news is, and I think it\u2019s true in Richmond, teenage use is down of cocaine, substantially, 60% in the last couple of years. So we\u2019re making progress but until we get that one done, we\u2019re not going to solve the neighborhood crime problem."}

I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and I\u2019m worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions. This is a very important topic and it\u2019s a very sensitive topic, because a lot of good people disagree on the issue. I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America. Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country. Life of the unborn. As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life. I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America. What I do believe is that we can find good, common ground on issues of parental consent or parental notification. I know we need to ban partial birth abortions. This is a place where my opponent and I have strong disagreement. I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America. This is an issue that will require a new attitude. We\u2019ve been battling over abortion for a long period of time. Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life. Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors to \u2014 to allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors. Surely we can work together to create a cultural life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbor\u2019s life with a gun will understand that that\u2019s not the way America is meant to be.

I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don\u2019t get in the hands of people that shouldn\u2019t have them.

S. attorneys and said: Put together a task force all around the country to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns. And the prosecutions are up by about 68 percent \u2014 I believe \u2014 is the number. Neighborhoods are safer when we crack down on people who commit crimes with guns. To me, that\u2019s the best way to secure America."}

And I think you know that I\u2019ve opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I don\u2019t see any evidence that it\u2019s a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime. We\u2019ve done so in my own state. And it\u2019s one of the reasons why we have had the biggest drop in crime of any industrial state in America; why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in America. But we have work to do in this nation. We have work to do to fight a real war, not a phony war, against drugs. And that\u2019s something I want to lead, something we haven\u2019t had over the course of the past many years, even though the Vice President has been at least allegedly in charge of that war. We have much to do to step up that war, to double the number of drug enforcement agents, to fight both here and abroad, to work with our neighbors in this hemisphere. And I want to call a hemispheric summit just as soon after the 20th of January as possible to fight that war. But we also have to deal with drug education prevention here at home. And that\u2019s one of the things that I hope I can lead personally as the President of the United States. We\u2019ve had great success in my own state. And we\u2019ve reached out to young people and their families and been able to help them by beginning drug education and prevention in the early elementary grades. So we can fight this war, and we can win this war. And we can do so in a way that marshals our forces, that provides real support for state and local law enforcement officers who have not been getting that support, and do it in a way which will bring down violence in this nation, will help our youngsters to stay away from drugs, will stop this avalanche of drugs that\u2019s pouring into the country, and will make it possible for our kids and our families to grow up in safe and secure and decent neighborhoods."}

That\u2019s why I\u2019m for instant background checks at gun shows, I\u2019m for trigger locks, I think that makes sense. Matter of fact, we distributed free trigger locks in the State of Texas so that people can get them and put them on their guns to make their guns more safe. I think we ought to raise the age at which juveniles can have a gun. But I also believe strongly that we need to enforce laws on the books that the best way to make sure that we keep our society safe and secure is to hold people accountable for breaking the law. If we catch somebody illegally selling a gun, there needs to be a consequence. If we keep somebody \u2014 you know, illegally using a gun, there needs to be a consequence. Enforcement of law, and the federal government can help. There is a great program called Project Exile in Richmond, Virginia, where we focused federal taxpayers\u2019 money and federal prosecutors and went after people who were illegally using guns.

It\u2019s an easy one. I\u2019m really fortunate. I grew up in a wonderful household with great Irish Catholic parents. My mom and dad are sitting right here. I was educated by Jesuits at Rockhurst High School in Kansas City. My 40th reunion is in 10 days. And I worked with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras, now nearly 35 years ago, and they were the heroes of my life. I try to practice my religion in a very devout way and follow the teachings of my church in my own personal life. But I don\u2019t believe in this nation, a First Amendment nation, where we don\u2019t raise any religion over the other, and we allow people to worship as they please, that the doctrines of any one religion should be mandated for everyone. For me, the hardest struggle in my faith life was the Catholic Church is against the death penalty and so am I. But I was governor of a state, and the state law said that there was a death penalty for crimes if the jury determined them to be heinous. And so I had to grapple with that. When I was running for governor, I was attacked pretty strongly because of my position on the death penalty. But I looked the voters of Virginia in the eye and said, look, this is my religion. I\u2019m not going to change my religious practice to get one vote, but I know how to take an oath and uphold the law. And if you elect me, I will uphold the law. And I was elected, and I did. It was very, very difficult to allow executions to go forward, but in circumstances where I didn\u2019t feel like there was a case for clemency, I told Virginia voters I would uphold the law, and I did. That was a real struggle. But I think it is really, really important that those of us who have deep faith lives don\u2019t feel like we could just substitute our own views for everybody else in society, regardless of their views."}

Let me answer your question and I hope it doesn\u2019t get too personal or maudlin. Barb and I lost a child, you know that we lost a daughter, Robin. I was over running records in west Texas, and I got a call from her, come home; went to the doctor; the doctor said, beautiful child, your child has a few weeks to live. And I said, what can we do about it. He said, no, she has leukemia, acute leukemia, a few weeks to live. We took the child to New York. Thanks to the miraculous sacrifice of doctors and nurses, the child stayed alive for six months and then died. If that child were here today, and I was told the same thing, my granddaughter, Noel for example that child could stay alive for ten or fifteen years, or maybe for the rest of her life. And so I don\u2019t think that you make an exception based on medical knowledge at the time. I think human life is very, very precious. And, look, this hasn\u2019t been an easy decision for me to meet. I know others disagree with it. But when I was in that little church across the river from Washington and saw our grandchild christened in our faith, I was very pleased indeed that the mother had not aborted that child, and put the child up for adoption.

We need a hundred thousand more police on the street. I have a plan for that. Secondly, we ought to have treatment on demand. Thirdly, we ought to have boot camps for first-time nonviolent offenders so they can get discipline and treatment and education and get reconnected to the community before they\u2019re severed and sent to prison, where they can learn how to be first class criminals. There is a crime bill that, lamentably, was blocked from passage once again, mostly by Republicans in the US Senate, which would have addressed some of these problems.

But that having been said, I believe that \u2014 well, first of all, let me say that the governor and I agree on some things where this subject is concerned. I will not do anything to affect the rights of hunters or sportsmen. I think that homeowners have to be respected and their right to have a gun if they wish to. The problem I see is that there are too many guns getting into the hands of children, and criminals, and people who, for whatever reason, some kind of history of stalking or domestic abuse really should not be able to get guns. I think these assault weapons are a problem. So I favor closing the gun show loophole. In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to close it, but then the majority in the House of Representatives went the other way. That\u2019s still pending. If we could get agreement on that, maybe they could pass that in the final days of this Congress. I think we ought to restore the three-day waiting period under the Brady Law. I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively. Some of the restrictions that have been placed by the Congress in the last couple of years. I think \u2014 in the last few years I think have been unfortunate.

I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years. I represented upstate New York. I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership. It goes back to the founding of our country. But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation. Because I support the Second Amendment doesn\u2019t mean that I want people who shouldn\u2019t have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family. And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns. I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole. There\u2019s other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment. You mentioned the Heller decision. And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them. And the court didn\u2019t accept that reasonable regulation, but they\u2019ve accepted many others. So I see no conflict between saving people\u2019s lives and defending the Second Amendment."}

Drug counselors out there in the street who are providing help to youngsters who come up to me and others who ask for help and want help, are doing the hard work, the heroic work, which it takes to provide that kind of leadership, that kind of counseling, that kind of support. I think of people in the law enforcement community who are taking their lives in their hands everyday, when they go up to one of those doors and kick it down and try to stop this flow of drugs into our communities and into our kids. So there are many, many heroes in this country today. These are people that give of themselves everyday and every week and every month. In many cases they are people in the community who are examples, and are role models. And I would hope that one of the things I could do as president is to recognize them, to give them the kind of recognition that they need and deserve so that more and more young people can themselves become the heroes of tomorrow, can go into public service, can go into teaching, can go into drug counseling, can go into law enforcement, and be heroes themselves to generations yet to come."}

He\u2019s created 10 and a half million new jobs. He\u2019s promised to cut the budget deficit in half. He has cut it by 60 percent. He promised to end welfare as we know it. He passed and signed the Welfare Reform Law. He has already moved 1.9 million people off the welfare rolls into good jobs. We\u2019ve got a plan to move 1 million more off welfare during the next four years. He promised to implement the death penalty. We passed an anti-crime Bill that has 60 new death penalty provisions. He promised to pass a plan that would put 100,000 new police officers on the streets. It is law, over the opposition of Senator Dole, and 20,000 of them are already on the streets, 2,000 of them have been funded already for here in Florida. We\u2019re ahead of schedule and we\u2019re going to get the additional 80,000 new police officers on the streets in the coming four years, 45,000 of them are now already funded. That is a record of promises made and promises kept. He promised middle-income tax cuts. We\u2019ve cut taxes for 15 million families and our plan to cut them for all middle income families has been waiting for action in the Congress for two full years.

I don\u2019t agree with a lot of things he said in this campaign. But I have a lot of respect for him.

Growing up in a working class family, having the opportunity to go to a great public school system, then to go on to college and then to be drawn really by President Kennedy, as well as the values of service my family gave me, into public life. Wanting to make a difference. I have had extraordinary opportunities, thanks again to those folks back home in Connecticut, \u00c2 as a state senator, attorney general trying to enforce the law to protect them and the environment and consumers, and to litigate on behalf of humans rights. And for the last 12 years as a member of the Senate of the United States focusing on national security questions, environmental protection, economic growth and values. But perhaps what I most bring is a friendship and shared values and shared priorities with Al Gore. I have tremendous respect for Al Gore. I\u2019ve known him for 15 years. He\u2019s an outstanding person as a public official and as a private person. His life is built on his faith. It\u2019s devoted to his family. He volunteered for service in Vietnam from the beginning. In Congress he\u2019s been willing to take on the big interests and fight for average people. As vice president I think he\u2019s been the most effective vice president in the history of the United States and he has the right program to use the prosperity all the American people have earned to help particularly hard working middle-class families raise up their children to enjoy a better life.

I have worked with Latinos\u2014one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote.

I want to keep our neighborhoods much, much better in terms of anti-crime, and that\u2019s why I would appoint judges that have a little more sympathy for the victims of crime and a little less for the criminals. That\u2019s why I do feel if some police officer is gunned down that the death penalty is required. I want to help those with disabilities fit into the mainstream. There is much to be done. This election is about big things. And perhaps the biggest is world peace. And I ask you to consider the experience I have had in working with a President who has revolutionized the situation around the world. America stands tall again, and as a result, we are credible. And we have now achieved an historic arms control agreement. I want to build on that. I\u2019d love to be able to say to my grandchildren, four years after my first term, I\u2019d like to say, your grandfather, working with the leaders of the Soviet Union, working with the leaders of Europe, was able to ban chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth. Lincoln called this country the last best hope of man on earth. And he was right then, and we still are the last best hope of man on earth. And I ask for your support on November 8th. And I will be a good president. Working together, we can do wonderful things for the United States and the Free World. Thank you very, very much."}

And Mr. Bush is right \u2013 the two go hand in hand. But if our government itself is doing business with people who we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking, if we don\u2019t understand that that sends out a very, very bad message to our young people, it\u2019s a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that I talked about and to young people like her all over the country, and say to them we want to help you. Now, I\u2019ve outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad, doubling the number of drug enforcement agents, having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together. But we also have to take demand seriously. You know, we have five percent of the world\u2019s population in this country. We\u2019re consuming 50 percent of the world\u2019s cocaine. And in my state I\u2019m proud to say we\u2019ve organized a drug education and prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for the country. We\u2019re helping youngsters; we\u2019re reaching out to them. And we\u2019re beginning with drug education and prevention beginning in the early elementary grades in every elementary school in our state, and that\u2019s the kind of effort we need in every elementary school in the United States of America. And we\u2019ve got to begin early, in the first, second and third grade, before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very, very dangerous substances. I guess the question I would ask of Mr. Bush is how we instill those values, how we create this environment for the drug free schools that we want in this country. If he or representatives of the administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy, or don\u2019t pursue that connection in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an example to our kids all over the country."}

And thank you to the people of Hartford, our hosts. I want to begin by saying again how much I respect Senator Dole and his record of public service and how hard I will try to make this campaign and this debate one of ideas, not insults. Four years ago I ran for president at a time of high unemployment and rising frustration. I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community where everybody has a role to play. I wanted a government that was smaller and less bureaucratic to help people make the most of their own lives. Four years ago you took me on faith. Now there\u2019s a record: Ten and a half million more jobs, rising incomes, falling crime rates and welfare rolls, a strong America at peace. We are better off than we were four years ago. Let\u2019s keep it going. We cut the deficit by 60 percent. Now, let\u2019s balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans. Now let\u2019s pass the tax cuts for education and child rearing, help with medical emergencies, and buying a home. We passed family and medical leave. Now let\u2019s expand it so more people can succeed as parents and in the work force. We passed 100,000 police, the assault weapons ban, the Brady Bill. Now let\u2019s keep going by finishing the work of putting the police on the street and tackling juvenile gangs. We passed welfare reform. Now let\u2019s move a million people from welfare to work. And most important, let\u2019s make education our highest priority so that every eight-year-old will be able to read, every 12-year-old can log onto the Internet, every 18-year-old can go to college. We can build that bridge to the 21st Century. And I look forward to discussing exactly how we\u2019re going to do it."}

One is to speed up generic drugs to the marketplace, quicker. Pharmaceuticals were using loopholes to keep brand \u2014 brand drugs in place, and generics are much less expensive than brand drugs. And we\u2019re doing just that. Another is to pass \u2014 to get our seniors to sign up to these drug discount cards, and they\u2019re working.

We, of course, don\u2019t want to have automatic weapons, and that\u2019s already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons. What I believe is we have to do, as the president mentioned towards the end of his remarks there, which is to make enormous efforts to enforce the gun laws that we have, and to change the culture of violence that we have. And you ask how \u2014 how are we going to do that? And there are a number of things. He mentioned good schools. I totally agree. We were able to drive our schools to be number one in the nation in my state. And I believe if we do a better job in education, we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll give people the \u2014 the hope and opportunity they deserve and perhaps less violence from that. But let me mention another thing. And that is parents. We need moms and dads, helping to raise kids. Wherever possible the \u2014 the benefit of having two parents in the home, and that\u2019s not always possible. A lot of great single moms, single dads. But gosh to tell our kids that before they have babies, they ought to think about getting married to someone, that\u2019s a great idea. Because if there\u2019s a two parent family, the prospect of living in poverty goes down dramatically. The opportunities that the child will \u2014 will be able to achieve increase dramatically. So we can make changes in the way our culture works to help bring people away from violence and give them opportunity, and bring them in the American system. The \u2014 the greatest failure we\u2019ve had with regards to \u2014 to gun violence in some respects is what \u2014 what is known as Fast and Furious. Which was a program under this administration, and how it worked exactly I think we don\u2019t know precisely, where thousands of automatic, and AK-47 type weapons were \u2014 were given to people that ultimately gave them to \u2014 to drug lords. They used those weapons against \u2014 against their own citizens and killed Americans with them. And this was a \u2014 this was a program of the government. For what purpose it was put in place, I can\u2019t imagine. But it\u2019s one of the great tragedies related to violence in our society which has occurred during this administration. Which I think the American people would like to understand fully, it\u2019s been investigated to a degree, but \u2014 but the administration has carried out executive privilege to prevent all of the information from coming out. I\u2019d like to understand who it was that did this, what the idea was behind it, why it led to the violence, thousands of guns going to Mexican drug lords. OBAMA: Candy?"}

They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life. And you\u2019re right. I don\u2019t want to rip families apart. I don\u2019t want to be sending parents away from children. I don\u2019t want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country. We have 11 million undocumented people. They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people. He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation. Now, here\u2019s what that means. It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented. And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country. I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation. I think it\u2019s an idea that would rip our country apart. I have been for border security for years. I voted for border security in the United States Senate. And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security. But I want to put our resources where I think they\u2019re most needed: Getting rid of any violent person. Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them. When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president. Didn\u2019t even raise it. He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we\u2019re not paying for that wall. So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly.

Welfare reform is one way to do it. If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids don\u2019t lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of families, to get off of welfare, to become independent and self-sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives, the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children. That\u2019s just one example of how you can save money and improve the quality of life at the same time. In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very unwisely. One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance. Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he can\u2019t play little league ball that he can\u2019t go out on the ball field because he\u2019s afraid he\u2019s going to get hurt. And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I don\u2019t think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital. So these are the ways that you help families, you help youngsters to live better lives, and more decent lives. Were ready to go to work at the state and local level, all of us. I know the private sector is. People are all over the country. But it takes presidential leadership. It takes a commitment to being involved and the leading.

National security is seen as best achieved by building relationships, reducing arms, and addressing the root causes of conflict rather than projecting power or engaging in military intervention.\n2. **Preventative Measures and Social Resilience**: Rather than focusing on crisis-driven, authoritative responses, this viewpoint emphasizes proactive, community-based approaches to maintain stability.

Since this campaign began I have had a very rare privilege. I have traveled to forty-eight of the fifty states and in my travels I have learned what the people of the United States are thinking about. There is one issue that stands out above all the rest, one in which every American is concerned, regardless of what group he may be a member and regardless of where he may live. And that issue, very simply stated, is this: how can we keep the peace \u2013 keep it without surrender? How can we extend freedom \u2013 extend it without war? Now in determining how we deal with this issue, we must find the answer to a very important but simple question: who threatens the peace? Who threatens freedom in the world? There is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom \u2013 that that is presented by the international Communist movement. And therefore if we are to have peace, we must know how to deal with the Communists and their leaders. I know Mr. Khrushchev. I also have had the opportunity of knowing and meeting other Communist leaders in the world. I believe there are certain principles we must find in dealing with him and his colleagues \u2013 principles, if followed, that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom. First, we have to learn from the past, because we cannot afford to make the mistakes of the past. In the seven years before this Administration came into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain. And at the end of that seven years we were engaged in a war in Korea which cost of thirty thousand American lives. In the past seven years, in President Eisenhower\u2019s Administration, this situation has been reversed. We ended the Korean War; by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars; and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table. Now why were we successful, as our predecessors were not successful? I think there\u2019re several reasons. In the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the Communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world. One of the major errors they made was the one that led to the Korean War. In ruling out the defense of Korea, they invited aggression in that area. They thought they were going to have peace \u2013 it brought war. We learned from their mistakes. And so, in our seven years, we find that we have been firm in our diplomacy; we have never made concessions without getting concessions in return. We have always been willing to go the extra mile to negotiate for disarmament or in any other area. But we have never been willing to do anything that, in effect, surrendered freedom any place in the world. That is why President Eisenhower was correct in not apologizing or expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev at the Paris Conference, as Senator Kennedy suggested he could have done. That is why Senator wh- President Eisenhower was also correct in his policy in the Formosa Straits, where he declined, and refused to follow the recommendations \u2013 recommendations which Senator Kennedy voted for in 1955; again made in 1959; again repeated in his debates that you have heard \u2013 recommendations with regard to \u2013 again \u2013 slicing off a piece of free territory, and abandoning it, if \u2013 in effect, to the Communists. Why did the President feel this was wrong and why was the President right and his critics wrong? Because again this showed a lack of understanding of dictators, a lack of understanding particularly of Communists, because every time you make such a concession it does not lead to peace; it only encourages them to blackmail you. It encourages them to begin a war. And so I say that the record shows that we know how to keep the peace, to keep it without surrender. Let us move now to the future. It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical\u2026 leaders that the world has ever seen. That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area. First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have \u2013 if the should launch a surprise attack \u2013 we will be able to destroy their war-making capability. They must know, in other words, that it is national suicide if they begin anything. We need this kind of strength because we\u2019re the guardians of the peace. In addition to military strength, we need to see that the economy of this country continues to grow. It has grown in the past seven years. It can and will grow even more in the next four. And the reason that it must grow even more is because we have things to do at home and also because we\u2019re in a race for survival \u2013 a race in which it isn\u2019t enough to be ahead; it isn\u2019t enough simply to be complacent. We have to move ahead in order to stay ahead. And that is why, in this field, I have made recommendations which I am confident will move the American economy ahead \u2013 move it firmly and soundly so that there will never be a time when the Soviet Union will be able to challenge our superiority in this field. And so we need military strength, we need economic strength, we also need the right diplomatic policies. What are they? Again we turn to the past. Firmness but no belligerence, and by no belligerence I mean that we do not answer insult by insult. When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues. And that example that President Eisenhower has set we will continue to follow. But all this by itself is not enough. It is not enough for us simply to be the strongest nation militarily, the strongest economically, and also to have firm diplomacy. We must have a great goal. And that is: not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world, to extend it to all the world because that is America\u2019s destiny. To extend it to all the world because the Communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend Communism. And you cannot fight a victory for Communism or a strategy of victory for Communism with the strategy, simply of holding the line. And so I say that we believe that our policies of military strength, of economic strength, of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep it without surrender. We also believe that in the great field of ideals that we can lead America to the victory for freedom \u2013 victory in the newly developing countries, victory also in the captive countries \u2013 provided we have faith in ourselves and faith in our principles."}

As a matter of fact, I brought Republicans and Democrats together to do just that in the State of Texas to get a patient\u2019s bill of rights through. It requires a different kind of leadership style to do it, though. You see, in order to get something done on behalf of the people, you have to put partisanship aside, and that\u2019s what we did in my state. We have one of the most advanced patient\u2019s bill of rights. It says, for example, that a woman doesn\u2019t have to go through a gate keeper to go to her gynecologist. It says that you can\u2019t gag a doctor, doctor can advise you. The HMO, the insurance company, can\u2019t gag that doctor from giving you full advice. And this particular bill, it allows patients to choose a doctor, their own doctor if they want to. But we did something else that was interesting. We\u2019re one of the first states that said you can sue an HMO for denying you proper coverage. Now there\u2019s what\u2019s called an Independent Review Organization that you have to go through first. It says if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a complaint with your insurance company, you can take your complaint to an objective body. If the objective body rules on your behalf, the insurance company must follow those rules. However, if the insurance company doesn\u2019t follow the findings of the IRO, then that becomes a cause of action in a court of law. It\u2019s time for our nation to come together and do what\u2019s right for the people, and I think this is right for the people.

The other thing that\u2019s on the court, and if it\u2019s struck down, what happens? Women\u2019s rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. They\u2019re able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets. And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and there\u2019s a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and they\u2019ll be taken away as well. Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. And so it\u2019s just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the Senate is Republican, then he goes forward. If not, we should wait until February."}

It is breaking family budgets. I can\u2019t tell you how many people I meet who don\u2019t have health insurance. If you\u2019ve got health insurance, most of you have seen your premiums double over the last eight years. And your co-payments and deductibles have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alone. If you\u2019re a small business, it\u2019s a crushing burden. So one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing. So here\u2019s what I would do. If you\u2019ve got health care already, and probably the majority of you do, then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it. You can keep your choice of doctor. We\u2019re going to work with your employer to lower the cost of your premiums by up to $2,500 a year. And we\u2019re going to do it by investing in prevention. We\u2019re going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital. That will reduce medical errors and reduce costs. If you don\u2019t have health insurance, you\u2019re going to be able to buy the same kind of insurance that Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees. Because there\u2019s a huge pool, we can drop the costs. And nobody will be excluded for pre-existing conditions, which is a huge problem. Now, Senator McCain has a different kind of approach. He says that he\u2019s going to give you a $5,000 tax credit. What he doesn\u2019t tell you is that he is going to tax your employer-based health care benefits for the first time ever. So what one hand giveth, the other hand taketh away. He would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure you\u2019re not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered. And that is fundamentally the wrong way to go. In fact, just today business organizations like the United States Chamber of Commerce, which generally are pretty supportive of Republicans, said that this would lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system. That, I don\u2019t think, is the kind of change that we need. We\u2019ve got to have somebody who is fighting for patients and making sure that you get decent, affordable health care. And that\u2019s something that I\u2019m committed to doing as president."}

In a country as wealthy as ours, for us to have people who are going bankrupt because they can\u2019t pay their medical bills \u2014 for my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because they\u2019re saying that this may be a pre-existing condition and they don\u2019t have to pay her treatment, there\u2019s something fundamentally wrong about that. So let me \u2014 let me just talk about this fundamental difference. And, Tom, I know that we\u2019re under time constraints, but Senator McCain through a lot of stuff out there. Number one, let me just repeat, if you\u2019ve got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it. All I\u2019m going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it. You\u2019ll still have choice of doctor. There\u2019s no mandate involved. Small businesses are not going to have a mandate. What we\u2019re going to give you is a 50 percent tax credit to help provide health care for those that you need. Now, it\u2019s true that I say that you are going to have to make sure that your child has health care, because children are relatively cheap to insure and we don\u2019t want them going to the emergency room for treatable illnesses like asthma. And when Senator McCain says that he wants to provide children health care, what he doesn\u2019t mention is he voted against the expansion of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program that is responsible for making sure that so many children who didn\u2019t have previously health insurance have it now. Now, the final point I\u2019ll make on this whole issue of government intrusion and mandates \u2014 it is absolutely true that I think it is important for government to crack down on insurance companies that are cheating their customers, that don\u2019t give you the fine print, so you end up thinking that you\u2019re paying for something and, when you finally get sick and you need it, you\u2019re not getting it. And the reason that it\u2019s a problem to go shopping state by state, you know what insurance companies will do? They will find a state \u2014 maybe Arizona, maybe another state \u2014 where there are no requirements for you to get cancer screenings, where there are no requirements for you to have to get pre-existing conditions, and they will all set up shop there. That\u2019s how in banking it works. Everybody goes to Delaware, because they\u2019ve got very \u2014 pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards. And in that situation, what happens is, is that the protections you have, the consumer protections that you need, you\u2019re not going to have available to you. That is a fundamental difference that I have with Senator McCain. He believes in deregulation in every circumstance. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been going through for the last eight years. It hasn\u2019t worked, and we need fundamental change."}

I would suggest that these proposals could be mentioned. First, after each of my foreign trips I have made recommendations that have been adopted. For example, after my first trip abroad \u2013 abroad, I strongly recommended that we increase our exchange programs particularly as they related to exchange of persons of leaders in the labor field and in the information field. After my trip to South America, I made recommendations that a separate inter-American lending agency be set up which the South American nations would like much better than a lend- than to participate in the lending agencies which treated all the countries of the world the same. Uh \u2013 I have made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian refugee situation which were adopted, not only by the President but some of them were enacted into law by the Congress. Within the Administration, as a chairman of the President\u2019s Committee on Price Stability and Economic Growth, I have had the opportunity to make recommendations which have been adopted within the Administration and which I think have been reasonably effective. I know Senator Kennedy suggested in his speech at Cleveland yesterday that that committee had not been particularly effective.

Uh \u2013 Also, so that we can get the uh \u2013 opportunity for the questioners to question me, it will be before the next television debate. Uh \u2013 I will say simply, in advance of it, that I believe that in this area, the laws which should be passed uh \u2013 as far as the big national emergency strikes are concerned, are ones that will give the president more weapons with which to deal with those strikes. Now, I have a basic disagreement with Senator Kennedy, though, on this point. He has taken the position, when he first indicated in October of last year, that he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons the president might have to stop a national emergency strike. I understand in his last speech before the Steelworkers Union, that he changed that position and indicated that he felt that government seizure might be the best way to stop a strike which could not be settled by collective bargaining. I do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure. I think the moment that you give to the union, on the one side, and to management, on the other side, the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled, that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government, and that will be a \u2013 be in the end, in my opinion, wage control; it would mean price control \u2013 all the things that we do not want. I do believe, however, that we can give to the president of the United States powers, in addition to what he presently has in the fact finding area, which would enable him to be more effective than we have been in handling these strikes. One last point I should make. The record in handling them has been very good during this Administration. We have had less man-hours lost by strikes in these last seven years than we had in the previous seven years, by a great deal. And I only want to say that however good the record is, it\u2019s got to be better. Because in this critical year \u2013 period of the sixties we\u2019ve got to move forward, all Americans must move forward together, and we have to get the greatest cooperation possible between labor and management. We cannot afford stoppages of massive effect on the economy when we\u2019re in the terrible competition we\u2019re in with the Soviets."}

This was a bipartisan idea. In fact, it was a Republican idea. And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation. And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it\u2019s the same plan. It \u2014 when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we\u2019ve created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall? Because there \u2014 there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis. One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that\u2019s been the trend line. Or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective? And there are ways of doing it. So at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average. And the reason they do is because they do some smart things. They \u2014 they say, if a patient\u2019s coming in, let\u2019s get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests. Let\u2019s make sure that we\u2019re providing preventive care so we\u2019re catching the onset of something like diabetes. Let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they\u2019ve \u2014 they\u2019ve engaged in. Now, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let\u2019s use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do. And the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we\u2019re going to be in a position to show that costs are going down. And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up \u2014 it\u2019s true \u2014 but they\u2019ve gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years. So we\u2019re already beginning to see progress. In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you\u2019re already getting a rebate. Let me make one last point. Governor Romney says, we should replace it, I\u2019m just going to repeal it, but \u2014 but we can replace it with something. But the problem is, he hasn\u2019t described what exactly we\u2019d replace it with, other than saying we\u2019re going to leave it to the states. But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he\u2019s offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there\u2019s no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who\u2019s got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance. In fact, it\u2019s estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you\u2019re looking at 50 million people losing health insurance\u2026"}

If we had done what Senator Obama wanted done in Iraq, and that was set a date for withdrawal, which General Petraeus, our chief \u2014 chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff said would be a very dangerous course to take for America, then we would have had a wider war, we would have been back, Iranian influence would have increased, al Qaeda would have re- established a base. There was a lot at stake there, my friends. And I can tell you right now that Senator Obama would have brought our troops home in defeat. I\u2019ll bring them home with victory and with honor and that is a fundamental difference. The United States of America, Tom, is the greatest force for good, as I said. And we must do whatever we can to prevent genocide, whatever we can to prevent these terrible calamities that we have said never again. But it also has to be tempered with our ability to beneficially affect the situation. That requires a cool hand at the tiller. This requires a person who understands what our \u2014 the limits of our capability are. We went in to Somalia as a peacemaking organization, we ended up trying to be \u2014 excuse me, as a peacekeeping organization, we ended up trying to be peacemakers and we ended up having to withdraw in humiliation. In Lebanon, I stood up to President Reagan, my hero, and said, if we send Marines in there, how can we possibly beneficially affect this situation? And said we shouldn\u2019t. Unfortunately, almost 300 brave young Marines were killed. So you have to temper your decisions with the ability to beneficially affect the situation and realize you\u2019re sending America\u2019s most precious asset, American blood, into harm\u2019s way. And, again, I know those situations. I\u2019ve been in them all my life. And I can tell you right now the security of your young men and women who are serving in the military are my first priority right after our nation\u2019s security. And I may have to make those tough decisions. But I won\u2019t take them lightly. And I understand that we have to say never again to a Holocaust and never again to Rwanda. But we had also better be darn sure we don\u2019t leave and make the situation worse, thereby exacerbating our reputation and our ability to address crises in other parts of the world."}

When you include the Iraqi security forces that have suffered casualties, as well as the allies, they\u2019ve taken almost 50 percent of the casualties in operations in Iraq, which leaves the U.S. with 50 percent, not 90 percent. With respect to the cost, it wasn\u2019t $200 billion. You probably weren\u2019t there to vote for that. But $120 billion is, in fact, what has been allocated to Iraq. The rest of it\u2019s for Afghanistan and the global war on terror. The allies have stepped forward and agreed to reduce and forgive Iraqi debt to the tune of nearly $80 billion by one estimate. That, plus $14 billion they promised in terms of direct aid, puts the overall allied contribution financially at about $95 billion, not to the $120 billion we\u2019ve got, but, you know, better than 40 percent. So your facts are just wrong, Senator. You also have a situation where you talk about credibility. It\u2019s awfully hard to convey a sense of credibility to allies when you voted for the war and then you declared: Wrong war, wrong place, wrong time. You voted for the war, and then you voted against supporting the troops when they needed the equipment, the fuel, the spare parts and the ammunition and the body armor. You\u2019re not credible on Iraq because of the enormous inconsistencies that John Kerry and you have cited time after time after time during the course of the campaign. Whatever the political pressures of the moment requires, that\u2019s where you\u2019re at.

Now that\u2019s not a government takeover. That\u2019s like the family of medical-leave law; it just tries to set the rules of the game. I\u2019m strongly in favor of a federal bill to repeal any gag rules on providers. In other words, I believe that doctors should not be able to be kicked out of managed care plans just because they tell the patients what they need and what more expensive care options might be. If we\u2019re saving money and managing resources better, that\u2019s a good thing. If we\u2019re saving money and depriving people of care, that\u2019s a bad thing.

That\u2019s explicitly prohibited in the law. But let\u2019s go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions. Well, actually Governor, that isn\u2019t what your plan does. What your plan does is to duplicate what\u2019s already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can\u2019t deny you if you\u2019ve \u2014 if it\u2019s been under 90 days. But that\u2019s already the law and that doesn\u2019t help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions. There\u2019s a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts. It wasn\u2019t a government takeover of health care. It was the largest expansion of private insurance. But what it does say is that \u201cinsurers, you\u2019ve got to take everybody.\u201d Now, that also means that you\u2019ve got more customers. But when \u2014 when Governor Romney says that he\u2019ll replace it with something, but can\u2019t detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isn\u2019t a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem. It just reminds me of, you know, he says that he\u2019s going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan. That\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be paid for, but we don\u2019t know the details. He says that he\u2019s going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don\u2019t know exactly which ones. He won\u2019t tell us. He now says he\u2019s going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don\u2019t have to worry. And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they\u2019re too good? Is it \u2014 is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them? No. The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we\u2019ve got to make choices. And the choices we\u2019ve made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country."}

First of all, he\u2019s wrong in thinking th- er- even suggesting that Mr. Khrushchev might have continued the conference if we had expressed regrets. He knew these flights were going on long before and that wasn\u2019t the reason that he broke up the conference. Second, he\u2019s wrong in the analogies that he makes. The United States is a strong country. Whenever we do anything that\u2019s wrong, we can express regrets. But when the president of the United States is doing something that\u2019s right, something that is for the purpose of defending the security of this country against surprise attack, he can never express regrets or apologize to anybody, including Mr. Khrushchev. Now in that connection Senator Kennedy has criticized the President on the ground not only of not expressing regrets, but because he allowed this flight to take place while the summit conference \u2013 or immediately before the summit conference occurred. This seems to me is criticism that again is wrong on his part. We all remember Pearl Harbor. We lost three thousand American lives. We cannot afford an intelligence gap. And I just want to make my position absolutely clear with regard to getting intelligence information. I don\u2019t intend to see to it that the United States is ever in a position where, while we\u2019re negotiating with the Soviet Union, that we discontinue our intelligence effort. And I don\u2019t intend ever to express regrets to Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else if I\u2019m doing something that has the support of the Congress and that is right for the purpose of protecting the security of the United States."}

I never suggested that compulsory arbitration was the solution for national emergency disputes. I\u2019m opposed to that, was opposed to it in October, 1958. I have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act. I don\u2019t know what other weapons the Vice President is talking about. I\u2019m talking about giving him four or five tools \u2013 not only the fact-finding committee that he now has under the injunction provision, not only the injunction, but also the power of the fact-finding commission to make recommendations \u2013 recommendations which would not be binding, but nevertheless would have great force of public opinion behind them. One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure. There might be others. By the president having five powers \u2013 four or five powers \u2013 and he only has very limited powers today, neither the company nor the union would be sure which power would be used; and therefore, there would be a greater incentive on both sides to reach an agreement themselves without taking it to the government. The difficulty now is the president\u2019s course is quite limited. He can set up a fact-finding committee. The fact-finding committee\u2019s powers are limited. He can provide an injunction if there\u2019s a national emergency for eighty days, then the strike can go on; and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the Congress. This is a difficult and sensitive matter. But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do. He could leave the parties in doubt as to which one he would use; and therefore there would be incentive, instead of as now \u2013 the steel companies were ready to take the strike because they felt the injunction of eighty days would break the union, which didn\u2019t happen."}

I think that Senator Kennedy\u2019s policies and recommendations for the handling of the Castro regime are probably the most dangers- dangerously irresponsible recommendations that he\u2019s made during the course of this campaign. In effect, what Senator Kennedy recommends is that the United States government should give help to the exiles and to those within Cuba who oppose the Castro regime \u2013 provided they are anti-Batista. Now let\u2019s just see what this means. We have five treaties with Latin America, including the one setting up the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948, in which we have agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of any other American country \u2013 and they as well have agreed to do likewise. The charter of the United Nations \u2013 its Preamble, Article I and Article II \u2013 also provide that there shall be no intervention by one nation in the internal affairs of another. Now I don\u2019t know what Senator Kennedy suggests when he says that we should help those who oppose the Castro regime, both in Cuba and without. But I do know this: that if we were to follow that recommendation, that we would lose all of our friends in Latin America, we would probably be condemned in the United Nations, and we would not accomplish our objective. I know something else. It would be an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to come in, to come into Latin America and to engage us in what would be a civil war, and possibly even worse than that. This is the major recommendation that he\u2019s made. Now, what can we do? Well, we can do what we did with Guatemala. There was a Communist dictator that we inherited from the previous Administration. We quarantined Mr. Arbenz. The result was that the Guatemalan people themselves eventually rose up and they threw him out. We are quarantining Mr. Castro today. We\u2019re quarantining him diplomatically by bringing back our Ambassador; economically by cutting off trade, and Senator Kennedy\u2019s suggestion that the trade that we cut off is not significant is just one hundred percent wrong. We are cutting off the significant items that the Cuban regime needs in order to survive. By cutting off trade, by cutting off our diplomatic relations as we have, we will quarantine this regime so that the people of Cuba themselves will take care of Mr. Castro. But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want."}

First of all, Joe Biden and I are both people of faith. And it\u2019s insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith, and in fact, Joe if elected will be only the second practicing Catholic, as President of the United States. On the issue of this nomination \u2013 Joe and I are very clear, as are the majority of the American people. We are 27 days before the decision about who will be the next president of the United States. And you know before, when this conversation has come up, you know it\u2019s been about election year or election time. We\u2019re literally in an election. Over 4 million people have voted. People are in the process of voting right now. And so Joe has been very clear, as the American people are: Let the American people fill that seat in the White House, and then we\u2019ll fill that seat on the United States Supreme Court. And to your point, Susan, the issues before us couldn\u2019t be more serious. There\u2019s the issue of choice, and I will always fight for a woman\u2019s right to make a decision about her own body. It should be her decision and not that of Donald Trump, and the Vice President, Michael Pence. But let\u2019s also look at what else is before the court. It\u2019s the Affordable Care Act. Like, literally in the midst of a public health pandemic \u2013 when over 210,000 people have died and 7 million people probably have what will be in the future considered a pre-existing condition because you contracted the virus \u2013 Donald Trump is in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I\u2019ve said it before and it bears repeating: This means that there will be no more protections, if they win, for people with pre-existing conditions. This means that over 20 million people will lose your coverage. It means that if you\u2019re under the age of 26, you can\u2019t stay on your parents coverage anymore. And here\u2019s the thing. The contrast couldn\u2019t be more clear. They\u2019re trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Joe Biden is saying let\u2019s expand coverage, let\u2019s give you a choice of a public option or private coverage, let\u2019s bring down premiums, let\u2019s lower Medicare eligibility to 60.

So if you\u2019re 60 or around 60 or older, you don\u2019t need to listen any further. But for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring. Oh, I just thought about one. And that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the president isn\u2019t proposing any changes for current retirees. In fact he is on Medicare. On Social Security he\u2019s not. But on Medicare, for current retirees, he\u2019s cutting $716 billion from the program. Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers. Actually just going to them and saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody\u2019s going to get a lower rate.\u201d That\u2019s not just going after places where there\u2019s abuse.

We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won\u2019t take more Medicare patients. This \u2014 we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts. I can\u2019t understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare. Now, you point out, well, we\u2019re putting some back. We\u2019re going to give a better prescription program. That\u2019s $1 \u2014 that\u2019s $1 for every $15 you\u2019ve cut. They\u2019re smart enough to know that\u2019s not a good trade.

One way, for instance, would be to have a single number. Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000. Anybody can have deductions up to that amount. And then that number disappears for high-income people. That\u2019s one way one could do it. One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way. There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth. And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre-existing condition plan. You obviously studied up on \u2014 on my plan. In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions. That\u2019s part of my health care plan. And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state. And I said that at that time. The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy."}

Look, as I travel around the country, this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again. Just yesterday, I was in Toledo shaking some hands in a line. Two women, both of them probably in their mid- to late-50s, had just been laid off of their plant. Neither of them have health insurance. And they were desperate for some way of getting coverage, because, understandably, they\u2019re worried that, if they get sick, they could go bankrupt. So here\u2019s what my plan does. If you have health insurance, then you don\u2019t have to do anything. If you\u2019ve got health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan. The only thing we\u2019re going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you. And we estimate we can cut the average family\u2019s premium by about $2,500 per year. If you don\u2019t have health insurance, then what we\u2019re going to do is to provide you the option of buying into the same kind of federal pool that both Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees, which will give you high-quality care, choice of doctors, at lower costs, because so many people are part of this insured group. We\u2019re going to make sure that insurance companies can\u2019t discriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions. We\u2019ll negotiate with the drug companies for the cheapest available price on drugs. We are going to invest in information technology to eliminate bureaucracy and make the system more efficient. And we are going to make sure that we manage chronic illnesses, like diabetes and heart disease, that cost a huge amount, but could be prevented. We\u2019ve got to put more money into preventive care. This will cost some money on the front end, but over the long term this is the only way that not only are we going to make families healthy, but it\u2019s also how we\u2019re going to save the federal budget, because we can\u2019t afford these escalating costs."}

Well, first of all, I admire Senator Kerry\u2019s service to our country. I admire the fact that he is a great dad.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. My concerns about the senator is that, in the course of this campaign, I\u2019ve been listening very carefully to what he says, and he changes positions on the war in Iraq. He changes positions on something as fundamental as what you believe in your core, in your heart of hearts, is right in Iraq. You cannot lead if you send mixed messages. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our troops. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our allies. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to the Iraqi citizens.

So let me try to answer you in this way. Let\u2019s start with a premise. We spend 30% more of our income than any nation on earth on health care, and yet we insure fewer people. We have 35 million people without any insurance at all \u2014 and I see them all the time. A hundred thousand Americans a month have lost their health insurance just in the last 4 years. So if you analyze where we\u2019re out of line with other countries, you come up with the following conclusions. Number one, we spend at least $60 billion a year on insurance, administrative cost, bureaucracy, and government regulation that wouldn\u2019t be spent in any other nation. So we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everybody. Employers would cover their employees, government would cover the unemployed. Number 2, I think you have to take on specifically the insurance companies and require them to make some significant change in the way they rate people in the big community pools. I think you have to tell the pharmaceutical companies they can\u2019t keep raising drug prices at three times the rate of inflation. I think you have to take on medical fraud. I think you have to help doctors stop practicing defensive medicine. I\u2019ve recommended that our doctors be given a set of national practice guidelines and that if they follow those guidelines that raises the presumption that they didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I think you have to have a system of primary and preventive clinics in our inner cities and our rural areas so people can have access to health care. The key is to control the cost and maintain the quality. To do that you need a system of managed competition where all of us are covered in big groups and we can choose our doctors and our hospitals, a wide range, but there is an incentive to control costs. And I think there has to be \u2014 I think Mr. Perot and I agree on this, there has to be a national commission of health care providers and health care consumers that set ceilings to keep health costs in line with inflation, plus population growth. Now, let me say, some people say we can\u2019t do this but Hawaii does it. They cover 98% of their people and their insurance premiums are much cheaper than the rest of America, and so does Rochester, New York. They now have a plan to cover everybody and their premiums are two-thirds of the rest of the country. This is very important. It\u2019s a big human problem and a devastating economic problem for America, and I\u2019m going to send a plan to do this within the first 100 days of my presidency. It\u2019s terribly important."}

And what would I do in this situation? I would make sure that the people in the cabinet and the people that are advisors to the president are called in, and I would talk to them, and I will work with them. And I will know them on a firsthand basis, because as vice president I will sit on the National Security Council. And I will know them on a firsthand basis, because I\u2019m going to be coordinating the drug effort. I will know them on a firsthand basis because Vice President George Bush is going to recreate the Space Council, and I will be in charge of that. I will have day-to-day activities with all the people in government. And then, if that unfortunate situation happens \u2013 if that situation, which would be very tragic, happens, I will be prepared to carry out the responsibilities of the presidency of the United States of America. And I will be prepared to do that. I will be prepared not only because of my service in the Congress, but because of my ability to communicate and to lead. It is not just age; it\u2019s accomplishments, it\u2019s experience. I have far more experience than many others that sought the office of vice president of this country. I have as much experience in the Congress as Jack Kennedy did when he sought the presidency. I will be prepared to deal with the people in the Bush administration, if that unfortunate event would ever occur."}

I think we have to make progress first in the field of employment. And there we would give statutory authority to the Committee on Government Contracts, which is an effective way of getting real progress made in this area, since about one out of every four jobs is held by and is allotted by people who have government contracts. Certainly I think all of us agree that when anybody has a government contract, certainly the money that is spent under that contract ought to be disbursed equally without regard to the race or creed or color of the individual who is to be employed. Second, in the field of schools, we believe that there should be provisions whereby the federal government would give assistance to those districts who do want to integrate their schools. That of course was rejected as was the government contracts provision by the special session of the Congress to \u2013 in which Mr. Kennedy was quite active. And then as far as other areas are concerned, I think that we have to look to presidential leadership. And when I speak of presidential leadership, I refer for example to our attitude on the sit-in strikes. Here we have a situation which causes all of us concern \u2013 causes us concern because of the denial of the rights of people to the equality which we think belongs to everybody. I have talked to Negro mothers. I\u2019ve heard them explain \u2013 try to explain \u2013 how they tell their children how they can go into a store and buy a loaf of bread but then can\u2019t go into that store and sit at the counter and get a Coca Cola. This is wrong, and we have to do something about it. So, under the circumstances, what do we do? Well what we do is what the Attorney-General of the United States did under the direction of the President: call in the owners of chain stores and get them to take action. Now there are other places where the executive can lead, but let me just sum up by saying this: why do I talk every time I\u2019m in the South on civil rights? Not because I am preaching to the people of the South because this isn\u2019t just a Southern problem; it\u2019s a Northern problem and a Western problem; it\u2019s a problem for all of us. I do it because it\u2019s the responsibility of leadership, I do it because we have to solve this problem together. I do it right at this time particularly because when we have Khrushchev in this country \u2013 a man who has enslaved millions, a man who has slaughtered thousands \u2013 we cannot continue to have a situation where he can point the finger at the United States of America and say that we are denying rights to our citizens. And so I say both the candidates and both the vice presidential candidates, I would hope as well \u2013 including Senator Johnson \u2013 should talk on this issue at every opportunity."}

And as I pointed out in 1952, I made it very clear that as far as the Korean War was concerned, that I felt that the decision to go into the war in Korea was right and necessary. What I criticized were the policies that made it necessary to go to Korea. Now incidentally, I should point out here that Senator Kennedy has attacked our foreign policy. He\u2019s said that it\u2019s been a policy that has led to defeat and retreat. And I\u2019d like to know where have we been defeated and where have we retreated? In the Truman Administration, six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain including the satellite countries of Eastern Europe and Communist China. In this Administration we\u2019ve stopped them at Quemoy and Matsu; we\u2019ve stopped them in Indochina; we\u2019ve stopped them in Lebanon; we\u2019ve stopped them in other parts of the world. I would also like to point out that as far as Senator Kennedy\u2019s comments are concerned, I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks we\u2019re wrong. But he has a responsibility to be accurate, and not to misstate the case. I don\u2019t think he should say that our prestige is at an all-time low. I think this is very harmful at a time Mr. Khrushchev is here \u2013 harmful because it\u2019s wrong. I don\u2019t think it was helpful when he suggested \u2013 and I\u2019m glad he\u2019s corrected this to an extent \u2013 that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night in the United States. Now this just wasn\u2019t true. Now, there are people who go to bed hungry in the United States \u2013 far less, incidentally, than used to go to bed hungry when we came into power at the end of the Truman Administration. But the thing that is right about the United States, it should be emphasized, is that less people go to bed hungry in the United States than in any major country in the world. We\u2019re the best fed; we\u2019re the best clothed, with a better distribution of this world\u2019s goods to all of our people than any people in history. Now, in pointing out the things that are wrong, I think we ought to emphasize America\u2019s strengths. It isn\u2019t necessary to \u2013 to run America down in order to build her up. Now so that we get it absolutely clear: Senator Kennedy must as a candidate \u2013 as I as a candidate in fifty-two \u2013 criticize us when we\u2019re wrong. And he\u2019s doing a very effective job of that, in his way. But on the other hand, he has a responsibility to be accurate. And I have a responsibility to correct him every time he misstates the case; and I intend to continue to do so."}

Now, in this connection I want to point out that the facts simply aren\u2019t as stated. First of all, the report to which Senator Kennedy refers is one that was made many, many months ago and related particularly to the uh \u2013 period immediately after Sputnik. Second, as far as this report is concerned, I would have no objection to having it made public. Third, I would say this with regard to this report, with regard to Gallup Polls of prestige abroad and everything else that we\u2019ve been hearing about \u201cwhat about American prestige abroad\u201d: America\u2019s prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for America allow it to be. Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example \u2013 Senator Kennedy \u2013 stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight \u2013 we\u2019ve had twenty-eight successful shots, they\u2019ve had eight; when he states that we\u2019re second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I\u2019ve seen ours, and we\u2019re not; that we\u2019re second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we\u2019re way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige? Well, it can only have the effect certainly of reducing it. Well let me make one thing clear. Senator Kennedy has a responsibility to criticize those things that are wrong, but he has also a responsibility to be right in his criticism. Every one of these items that I have mentioned he\u2019s been wrong \u2013 dead wrong. And for that reason he has contributed to any lack of prestige. Finally, let me say this: as far as prestige is concerned, the first place it would show up would be in the United Nations. Now Senator Kennedy has referred to the vote on Communist China. Let\u2019s look at the vote on Hungary. There we got more votes for condemning Hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year. Let\u2019s look at the reaction eh \u2013 reaction to Khrushchev and Eisenhower at the last U.N. session. Did Khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted? Not at all. The President gained. America gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it\u2019s that that keeps the prestige of America up, not running down America the way Senator Kennedy has been running her down."}

But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan. Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan. That\u2019s already offered in the private marketplace. You don\u2019t have to have the government mandate that for that to occur. But let\u2019s come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it\u2019s more affordable for families. And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have. In my opinion, the government is not effective in \u2014 in bringing down the cost of almost anything. As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be. Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe. This is the private market. These are small \u2014 these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs. I used to consult to businesses \u2014 excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers. I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people. In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don\u2019t need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have. We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that\u2019s happening. Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others. But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have. That\u2019s the wrong way to go. The private market and individual responsibility always work best."}

Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state. But let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing Iran and all that, let me tell you my record. Back in 1983, when I was a brand-new United States congressman, the one \u2014 the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon. And I saw that, and I saw the situation, and I stood up, and I voted against that, because I was afraid that they couldn\u2019t make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference. Tragically, I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks. And then we had Somalia \u2014 then we had the first Gulf War. I supported \u2014 I supported that. I supported us going into Bosnia, when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in Bosnia. That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe. I supported what we did in Kosovo. I supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there. And I have a record \u2014 and Somalia, I opposed that we should turn \u2014 turn the force in Somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of. So I have a record. I have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harm\u2019s way. And I\u2019ll tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, \u201cSenator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son\u2019s name on it.\u201d He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad, Matthew Stanley, before Christmas last year. This was last August, a year ago. And I said, \u201cI will \u2014 I will wear his bracelet with honor.\u201d And this was August, a year ago. And then she said, \u201cBut, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything \u2014 promise me one thing, that you\u2019ll do everything in your power to make sure that my son\u2019s death was not in vain.\u201d That means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re-enlisted in Baghdad, just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed. And they all say to me that we don\u2019t want defeat. I know what that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like when an army is defeated. A war that I was in, where we had an Army, that it wasn\u2019t through any fault of their own, but they were defeated. And I know how hard it is for that \u2014 for an Army and a military to recover from that. And it did and we will win this one and we won\u2019t come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail."}

I believe that part of the reason we have a difficult situation is because we made a bad judgment going into Iraq in the first place when we hadn\u2019t finished the job of hunting down bin Laden and crushing al Qaeda. So what happened was we got distracted, we diverted resources, and ultimately bin Laden escaped, set up base camps in the mountains of Pakistan in the northwest provinces there. They are now raiding our troops in Afghanistan, destabilizing the situation. They\u2019re stronger now than at any time since 2001. And that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s so important for us to reverse course, because that\u2019s the central front on terrorism. They are plotting to kill Americans right now. As Secretary Gates, the defense secretary, said, the war against terrorism began in that region and that\u2019s where it will end. So part of the reason I think it\u2019s so important for us to end the war in Iraq is to be able to get more troops into Afghanistan, put more pressure on the Afghan government to do what it needs to do, eliminate some of the drug trafficking that\u2019s funding terrorism. But I do believe that we have to change our policies with Pakistan. We can\u2019t coddle, as we did, a dictator, give him billions of dollars and then he\u2019s making peace treaties with the Taliban and militants. What I\u2019ve said is we\u2019re going to encourage democracy in Pakistan, expand our nonmilitary aid to Pakistan so that they have more of a stake in working with us, but insisting that they go after these militants. And if we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then I think that we have to act and we will take them out. We will kill bin Laden; we will crush Al Qaida. That has to be our biggest national security priority."}

You know, my hero is a guy named Teddy Roosevelt. Teddy Roosevelt used to say walk softly \u2014 talk softly, but carry a big stick. Senator Obama likes to talk loudly. In fact, he said he wants to announce that he\u2019s going to attack Pakistan. Remarkable. You know, if you are a country and you\u2019re trying to gain the support of another country, then you want to do everything you can that they would act in a cooperative fashion. When you announce that you\u2019re going to launch an attack into another country, it\u2019s pretty obvious that you have the effect that it had in Pakistan: It turns public opinion against us. Now, let me just go back with you very briefly. We drove the Russians out with \u2014 the Afghan freedom fighters drove the Russians out of Afghanistan, and then we made a most serious mistake. We washed our hands of Afghanistan. The Taliban came back in, Al Qaida, we then had the situation that required us to conduct the Afghan war. Now, our relations with Pakistan are critical, because the border areas are being used as safe havens by the Taliban and Al Qaida and other extremist organizations, and we have to get their support. Now, General Petraeus had a strategy, the same strategy \u2014 very, very different, because of the conditions and the situation \u2014 but the same fundamental strategy that succeeded in Iraq. And that is to get the support of the people. We need to help the Pakistani government go into Waziristan, where I visited, a very rough country, and \u2014 and get the support of the people, and get them to work with us and turn against the cruel Taliban and others. And by working and coordinating our efforts together, not threatening to attack them, but working with them, and where necessary use force, but talk softly, but carry a big stick."}

We have to double the size of the Afghan army. We have to have a streamlined NATO command structure. We have to do a lot of things. We have to work much more closely with the Pakistanis.

And the point is that that\u2019s the place where you\u2019re most likely to see the terrorists come together with weapons of mass destruction, the deadly technologies that Saddam Hussein had developed and used over the years. Now, the fact of the matter is, the big difference here, Gwen, is they are not prepared to deal with states that sponsor terror. They\u2019ve got a very limited view about how to use U.S. military forces to defend America. We heard Senator Kerry say the other night that there ought to be some kind of global test before U.S. troops are deployed preemptively to protect the United States. That\u2019s part of a track record that goes back to the 1970s when he ran for Congress the first time and said troops should not be deployed without U.N. approval. Then, in the mid-\u201980s, he ran on the basis of cutting most of our major defense programs. In 1991, he voted against Desert Storm. It\u2019s a consistent pattern over time of always being on the wrong side of defense issues. A little tough talk in the midst of a campaign or as part of a presidential debate cannot obscure a record of 30 years of being on the wrong side of defense issues. And they give absolutely no indication, based on that record, of being wiling to go forward and aggressively pursue the war on terror with a kind of strategy that will work, that will defeat our enemies and will guarantee that the United States doesn\u2019t again get attacked by the likes of Al Qaida."}

Do you agree with Secretary Chu that this is not the job of the Energy Department?","Dimension Description":"Dimension 5 - Positive Pole - t001327 - Dimension Description:\nThe opposite ideological components, countering the beliefs and assumptions provided, would represent a worldview that minimizes domestic energy production, discourages technological interventions in energy, and de-emphasizes economic and global competitiveness related to energy policy. Here are the reverse ideologies and beliefs:\n1. **Global Dependence and Energy Interdependence**: Rather than prioritizing domestic energy production, this perspective embraces energy interdependence, viewing reliance on foreign energy sources as beneficial for fostering international cooperation and mutual reliance. National security is seen as strengthened through global energy partnerships rather than through self-reliance.\n2. **Skepticism of Technological Intervention and Environmental Minimalism**: This viewpoint opposes reliance on technological solutions, instead favoring minimal interference with natural resources. There\u2019s a preference for traditional, low-tech methods over innovation, with an acceptance of environmental impacts as part of industrialization rather than prioritizing environmental responsibility.\n3. **Stable Economy through Reduced Innovation and Minimal Job Disruption**: This ideology does not emphasize job creation through new energy sectors or renewables. Instead, it supports economic stability by maintaining existing industries without pursuing major changes in energy technology, thus protecting traditional jobs and minimizing the disruption of established labor markets.\n4. **Immediate Gains and Short-Term Focus**: Opposing long-term planning, this perspective values immediate, short-term gains, with little concern for sustainability. Policies are designed to maximize current economic returns from energy resources without consideration for future impacts or energy crises, focusing on short-term profitability over future preparedness.\n5. **Limited Government Involvement in Energy Markets**: This ideology favors minimal government intervention, advocating for a laissez-faire approach to energy policy. It supports unrestricted market forces without regulatory oversight, seeing government incentives, emissions regulations, and public investments as undue interference that stifles economic freedom.\n6. **Isolationism and Limited Global Engagement**: Instead of aspiring to global leadership in energy technology, this perspective avoids competition on the world stage. It prefers an inward focus on domestic consumption over export-driven innovation, considering global competitiveness unnecessary. Exporting clean energy solutions or innovations is not prioritized.\nThese opposing beliefs suggest a **conservative, minimally interventionist approach** that prefers traditional, established energy methods, downplays environmental and technological concerns, and focuses on short-term economic stability over long-term energy or environmental sustainability. This view minimizes the role of government, discourages global competitiveness, and favors a limited role for the U.S. in international energy advancements.","Text":"The most important thing we can do is to make sure we control our own energy. So here\u2019s what I\u2019ve done since I\u2019ve been president. We have increased oil production to the highest levels in 16 years. Natural gas production is the highest it\u2019s been in decades. We have seen increases in coal production and coal employment. But what I\u2019ve also said is we can\u2019t just produce traditional source of energy. We\u2019ve also got to look to the future. That\u2019s why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars. That means that in the middle of the next decade, any car you buy, you\u2019re going to end up going twice as far on a gallon of gas. That\u2019s why we doubled clean \u2014 clean energy production like wind and solar and biofuels. And all these things have contributed to us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in 16 years. Now, I want to build on that. And that means, yes, we still continue to open up new areas for drilling. We continue to make it a priority for us to go after natural gas. We\u2019ve got potentially 600,000 jobs and 100 years worth of energy right beneath our feet with natural gas. And we can do it in an environmentally sound way. But we\u2019ve also got to continue to figure out how we have efficiency energy, because ultimately that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to reduce demand and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to keep gas prices lower. Now, Governor Romney will say he\u2019s got an all-of-the-above plan, but basically his plan is to let the oil companies write the energy policies. So he\u2019s got the oil and gas part, but he doesn\u2019t have the clean energy part. And if we are only thinking about tomorrow or the next day and not thinking about 10 years from now, we\u2019re not going to control our own economic future. Because China, Germany, they\u2019re making these investments. And I\u2019m not going to cede those jobs of the future to those countries. I expect those new energy sources to be built right here in the United States. That\u2019s going to help Jeremy get a job.

And the president\u2019s right in terms of the additional oil production, but none of it came on federal land. As a matter of fact, oil production is down 14 percent this year on federal land, and gas production was down 9 percent. Why? Because the president cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands, and in federal waters. So where\u2019d the increase come from? Well a lot of it came from the Bakken Range in North Dakota. What was his participation there? The administration brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil, this massive new resource we have. And what was the cost? 20 or 25 birds were killed and brought out a migratory bird act to go after them on a criminal basis. Look, I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables. I believe very much in our renewable capabilities; ethanol, wind, solar will be an important part of our energy mix. But what we don\u2019t need is to have the president keeping us from taking advantage of oil, coal and gas. This has not been Mr. Oil, or Mr. Gas, or Mr. Coal. Talk to the people that are working in those industries. I was in coal country. People grabbed my arms and said, \u201cPlease save my job.\u201d The head of the EPA said, \u201cYou can\u2019t build a coal plant. You\u2019ll virtually \u2014 it\u2019s virtually impossible given our regulations.\u201d When the president ran for office, he said if you build a coal plant, you can go ahead, but you\u2019ll go bankrupt. That\u2019s not the right course for America. Let\u2019s take advantage of the energy resources we have, as well as the energy sources for the future. And if we do that, if we do what I\u2019m planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, North America energy independence within eight years, you\u2019re going to see manufacturing jobs come back. Because our energy is low cost, that are already beginning to come back because of our abundant energy. I\u2019ll get America and North America energy independent. I\u2019ll do it by more drilling, more permits and licenses. We\u2019re going to bring that pipeline in from Canada. How in the world the president said no to that pipeline? I will never know. This is about bringing good jobs back for the middle class of America, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. CROWLEY: Mr. President, let me just see if I can move you to the gist of this question, which is, are we looking at the new normal? I can tell you that tomorrow morning, a lot of people in Hempstead will wake up and fill up and they will find that the price of gas is over $4 a gallon. Is it within the purview of the government to bring those prices down, or are we looking at the new normal?"}

What I\u2019ve had as a basic commitment since I\u2019ve been President is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It can only be done in two ways: one, to conserve energy \u2013 to stop the waste of energy \u2013 and, secondly, to produce more American energy. We\u2019ve been very successful in both cases. We\u2019ve now reduced the importing of foreign oil in the last year alone by one-third. We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same date just a year ago. This commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our nation in the future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels, yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy, yes; and also to produce the traditional kinds of American energy. We will drill more oil and gas wells this year than any year in history. We\u2019ll produce more coal this year than any year in history. We are exporting more coal this year than any year in history. And we have an opportunity now with improved transportation systems and improved loading facilities in our ports, to see a very good opportunity on a world international market, to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source. This exciting future will not only give us more energy security, but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that we\u2019ve put into effect."}

We believe \u2014 Barack Obama believes by investing in clean coal and safe nuclear, we can not only create jobs in wind and solar here in the United States, we can export it. China is building one to three new coal-fired plants burning dirty coal per week. It\u2019s polluting not only the atmosphere but the West Coast of the United States. We should export the technology by investing in clean coal technology. We should be creating jobs. John McCain has voted 20 times against funding alternative energy sources and thinks, I guess, the only answer is drill, drill, drill. Drill we must, but it will take 10 years for one drop of oil to come out of any of the wells that are going to begun to be drilled. In the meantime, we\u2019re all going to be in real trouble."}

In January of uh \u2013 1975 I submitted to the Congress and to the American people the first comprehensive energy program recommended by any president. It called for an increase in the production of energy in the United States. It called for uh \u2013 conservation measures so that we would save the energy that we have. If you\u2019re going to increase domestic oil and gas production \u2013 and we have to \u2013 you have to give those producers an opportunity to uh \u2013 develop their land or their wells. I recommended to the Congress that we should increase production in this country from six hundred million tons a year to twel- a- a billion two hundred million tons by 1985. In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground; we have to improve our utilization of coal \u2013 make it more efficient, make it cleaner. In addition we uh \u2013 have to expand our research and development. In my program for energy independence we have increased, for example, solar energy research from about $84 million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year. We\u2019re going as fast as the experts say we should. In nuclear power we have increased the research and development, uh \u2013 under the Energy Research and Development Agency uh \u2013 very substantially, to insure that our ener- uh \u2013 nuclear power plants are safer, that they are more efficient, and that we have adequate safeguards.

I think I know the \u2013 the uh capabilities and limitations of atomic power. But the energy \u2013 uh policy of our nation is one that uh has not yet been established under this administration. I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy except us. We have seen uh \u2013 the Federal Energy Agency established, for instance. Uh \u2013 in the crisis of 1973 it was supposed to be a temporary agency, uh now it\u2019s permanent, it\u2019s enormous, it\u2019s growing every day. I think the Wall Street Journal uh reported not too long ago they have a hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people its own existence. We\u2019ve got to have a \u2013 a firm way to handle the energy question. The reorganization proposal that I have put forward is one uh first step. In addition to that, we need to have \u2013 uh a realization that we\u2019ve got uh about thirty-five years worth of oil left in the whole world. We\u2019re gonna run out of oil. When Mr. Nixon made his famous uh speech on Operation Independence we were importing about 35 percent of our oil. Now we\u2019ve increased that amount 25 percent. We now import about 44 percent of our oil. We need to shift from oil to coal. We need to concentrate our research and development effort on uh coal burning and extraction, with safer mines, but also it\u2019s clean burning. We need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures. And then as a last resort only, continue to use atomic power. I would certainly uh \u2013 not cut out atomic power altogether. We can\u2019t afford to give up that opportunity until later. But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained. For instance, some that have been forgotten; we need to have the reactor core \u2013 below ground level, the entire power plant that uses atomic uh \u2013 power tightly sealed and a heavy \u2013 heavy vacuum maintained. There ought to be a standardized design. There ought to be a full-time uh \u2013 atomic energy specialist, independent of the power company in the control room, full time, twenty-four hours a day, to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops. These kinds of uh \u2013 procedures, along with evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated. So, shift from oil to coal, emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power, strict conservation measures, not yield every time that the special interest groups uh \u2013 put pressure on the president like uh this administration has done, and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strictest possible safety precautions.

Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and I\u2019m for it. But I do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the present energy problem, because all you\u2019re doing then is staving off, by a short time, the day when you would come to the end of the energy supply. To say that we are limited, and at a dangerous point in this country with regard to energy, I think, is to ignore the fact. The fact is, that in today\u2019s oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used. But it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground. And this is known oil reserves, known supplies. There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago. We have a coal supply that is equal to 50% of the world\u2019s coal supply, good for centuries, in this country. I grant you that prices may go up, because as you go further and have to go deeper, you are adding to the cost of production. We have nuclear power, which, I believe, with the safest. the most stringent of safety requirements, could meet our energy needs for the next couple of decades while we go forward exploring the areas of solar power and other forms of energy that might be renewable and that would not be exhaustible. All of these things can be done. When you stop and think that we are only drilling on 2%. have leased only 2% of the possible. possibility for oil of the continental shelf around the United States; when you stop to think that the government has taken over 100 million acres of land out of circulation in Alaska, alone, that is believed by geologists to contain much in the line of minerals and energy sources, then I think it is the Government, and the Government with its own restrictions and regulations, that is creating the energy crisis. That we are, indeed, an energy-rich nation."}

The chant is \u201cdrill, baby, drill.\u201d And that\u2019s what we hear all across this country in our rallies because people are so hungry for those domestic sources of energy to be tapped into. They know that even in my own energy-producing state we have billions of barrels of oil and hundreds of trillions of cubic feet of clean, green natural gas. And we\u2019re building a nearly $40 billion natural gas pipeline which is North America\u2019s largest and most you expensive infrastructure project ever to flow those sources of energy into hungry markets. Barack Obama and Senator Biden, you\u2019ve said no to everything in trying to find a domestic solution to the energy crisis that we\u2019re in. You even called drilling \u2014 safe, environmentally-friendly drilling offshore as raping the outer continental shelf. There \u2014 with new technology, with tiny footprints even on land, it is safe to drill and we need to do more of that. But also in that \u201call of the above\u201d approach that Senator McCain supports, the alternative fuels will be tapped into: the nuclear, the clean coal. I was surprised to hear you mention that because you had said that there isn\u2019t anything \u2014 such a thing as clean coal. And I think you said it in a rope line, too, at one of your rallies."}

Obviously, I disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to Russians going into Georgia. I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable. And, absolutely, I wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on Georgia, and that\u2019s why I was the first to say that we have to rebuild the Georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild. Because part of Russia\u2019s intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more. Two points I think are important to think about when it comes to Russia. Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems. So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory. That made no sense whatsoever. And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over. That wasn\u2019t done. But had it been done, it\u2019s possible we could have avoided the issue. The second point I want to make is \u2014 is the issue of energy. Russia is in part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as Senator McCain mentioned. That means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil \u2014 25 percent of the world\u2019s oil \u2014 have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with Russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states we\u2019ve talked about, Iran, Venezuela. And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world\u2019s oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world\u2019s oil. So we can\u2019t simply drill our way out of the problem. What we\u2019re going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology. And, you know, I\u2019ve got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that. And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record. Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel. And so we \u2014 we \u2014 we\u2019ve got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump \u2014 and, you know, winter\u2019s coming and home heating oil \u2014 as it is our national security and the issue of climate change that\u2019s so important."}

I think it\u2019s such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration. Under absolutely siege.

We have unbelievable\u2014we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet. So good. Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt.

They\u2019ll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous. But we are putting our energy companies out of business. We have to bring back our workers. You take a look at what\u2019s happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies. We have to guard our energy companies. We have to make it possible. The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business. And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they\u2019re doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business.

Secondly the difference is we need to explore at home. And the vice president doesn\u2019t believe in exploration in Alaska. There\u2019s a lot of shut-in gas that we need to be moving out of Alaska by pipeline. There\u2019s an interesting issue up in the northwest as well.

I\u2019m going to ask the Congress for $2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal technologies in the world. My answer to you is in the short-term we need to get after it here in America. We need to explore our resources and we need to develop our reservoirs of domestic production. We also need to have a hemispheric energy policy where Canada, Mexico and the United States come together. I brought this up recently with Vincent Fox the newly elected president in Mexico, he\u2019s a man I know from Mexico. I talked to him about how best to expedite the exploration of natural gas in Mexico and transport it up to the United States so we become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil.

My assessment is that there is no comprehensive energy policy today. That as a nation, we are in trouble because the administration has not addressed these issues. We have the prospects of brownouts in California. We have a potential home heating oil crisis in the northeast. We have gasoline price rises in various other places. For years now the administration has talked about reducing our dependence on foreign sources of oil, but they haven\u2019t done it. In fact, we\u2019ve gone exactly in the opposite direction. We have the lowest rate of domestic production of oil now in 46 years. You have to go back to 1954 to find a time when we produced as little oil as we do today. Our imports are at an all-time record high. In June we imported almost 12 million barrels of oil a day. That means we are more subject to the wide fluctuations and swings in price. We have other problems. We don\u2019t have refinery capacity. We haven\u2019t built a new refinery in this country for over ten years. They\u2019re operating at 96% or 97% capacity. Even with more crude available they\u2019re probably not going to be able to do very much by way of producing additional home heating oil for this winter. We have a growing problem with our growing dependence on foreign sources of energy. That will allways be the case but we ought to be able to shift the trend and begin to move it in the right direction. We need to do a lot more about generating the capacity for power here at home. We need to get on with the business and we think we can do it very safely in an environmentally sound manner. We don\u2019t think we ought to buy into this false choice that somehow we cannot develop energy resources without being cautious with the environment. We can. We have the technology to do it and we ought to do it. We do support the low income energy assistance program. We think it\u2019s important that senior citizens don\u2019t suffer this winter, but we need to get on to the business of having a plan to develop our domestic energy resources in producing more supplies, and this administration hasn\u2019t produced them."}

And the fact that you\u2019re making an investment in higher education is critical. Not just to you, but to the entire nation. Now, the most important thing we can do is to make sure that we are creating jobs in this country. But not just jobs, good paying jobs. Ones that can support a family. And what I want to do, is build on the five million jobs that we\u2019ve created over the last 30 months in the private sector alone. And there are a bunch of things we can do to make sure your future is bright. Number one, I want to build manufacturing jobs in this country again. Now when Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt. I said we\u2019re going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry and it\u2019s come surging back. I want to do that in industries, not just in Detroit, but all across the country and that means we change our tax code so we\u2019re giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the United States and creating jobs here. It also means we\u2019re helping them and small businesses to export all around the world to new markets. Number two, we\u2019ve got to make sure that we have the best education system in the world. And the fact that you\u2019re going to college is great, but I want everybody to get a great education and we\u2019ve worked hard to make sure that student loans are available for folks like you, but I also want to make sure that community colleges are offering slots for workers to get retrained for the jobs that are out there right now and the jobs of the future. Number three, we\u2019ve got to control our own energy. Now, not only oil and natural gas, which we\u2019ve been investing in; but also, we\u2019ve got to make sure we\u2019re building the energy source of the future, not just thinking about next year, but ten years from now, 20 years from now. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve invested in solar and wind and biofuels, energy efficient cars. We\u2019ve got to reduce our deficit, but we\u2019ve got to do it in a balanced way. Asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more along with cuts so that we can invest in education like yours. And let\u2019s take the money that we\u2019ve been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild America, roads, bridges schools. We do those things, not only is your future going to be bright but America\u2019s future is going to bright as well."}

In fact, if the \u2014 this administration had been given the amount of funding that it had requested from the Republican Congress, we would be further along in the implementation of that long-term strategy aimed at developing cleaner sources of energy, giving tax credits to individuals and businesses to conserve and use energy more efficiently. Aimed at a partnership for a new generation of vehicles with the American automobile industry which is making great progress and can produce a vehicle that can get 80 miles per gallon. We also have a short-term strategy. To deal with exactly the kind of ups and downs of energy prices. I know it was controversial, but Al Gore and I believed it was important in the short-term to reach into the strategic petroleum reserve, take some of the oil we have, put it in the market, show the big oil companies and the OPEC oil-producing countries that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got some resources with which we can fight back. We aren\u2019t going to lay back and let them roll over our economy. We did it also because gasoline prices were rising and home heating oil inventories were real low. Both of our tickets agree on LIHEAP keeping the low income housing assistance program, but our opponents offer no assistance to middle-class families hit by rising gas prices and a shortage of home heating oil. The fact is that since the reserve was opened the price of oil on world markets has dropped $6 a barrel. That\u2019s a good result and I\u2019m proud of it."}

And here is the simple difference. My plan has not only a short-term component, but also a long-term component. And it focuses not only on increasing the supply, which I think we have to do, but also on working on the consumption side. Now, in the short-term we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price from OPEC when they want to raise the price. And in the long-term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy. And domestic sources that are cleaner and better. And I\u2019m proposing a plan that will give tax credits and tax incentives for the rapid development of new kinds of cars and trucks and buses and factories and boilers and furnaces that don\u2019t have as much pollution, that don\u2019t burn as much energy, and that help us get out on the cutting edge of the new technologies that will create millions of new jobs. Because, when we sell these new products here, we\u2019ll then be able to sell them overseas. There is a ravenous demand for them overseas. Now, another big difference is Governor Bush is proposing to open up some of our most precious environmental treasures, like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for the big oil companies to go in and start producing oil there. I think that is the wrong choice. It would only give us a few months\u2019 worth of oil and the oil wouldn\u2019t start flowing for many years into the future. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a fair price to pay to destroy precious parts of America\u2019s environment. We have to bet on the future and move beyond the current technologies to have a whole new generation of more efficient, cleaner, energy technology."}

I think that\u2019s about a realistic timeframe. And this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face. Obviously, we\u2019ve got an immediate crisis right now. But nothing is more important than us no longer borrowing $700 billion or more from China and sending it to Saudi Arabia. It\u2019s mortgaging our children\u2019s future. Now, from the start of this campaign, I\u2019ve identified this as one of my top priorities and here is what I think we have to do. Number one, we do need to expand domestic production and that means, for example, telling the oil companies the 68 million acres that they currently have leased that they\u2019re not drilling, use them or lose them. And I think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil. But understand, we only have three to four percent of the world\u2019s oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world\u2019s oil, which means that we can\u2019t drill our way out of the problem. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve focused on putting resources into solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal. These have been priorities of mine since I got to the Senate, and it is absolutely critical that we develop a high fuel efficient car that\u2019s built not in Japan and not in South Korea, but built here in the United States of America. We invented the auto industry and the fact that we have fallen so far behind is something that we have to work on. Now I just want to make one last point because Senator McCain mentioned NAFTA and the issue of trade and that actually bears on this issue. I believe in free trade. But I also believe that for far too long, certainly during the course of the Bush administration with the support of Senator McCain, the attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement. And NAFTA doesn\u2019t have \u2014 did not have enforceable labor agreements and environmental agreements. And what I said was we should include those and make them enforceable. In the same way that we should enforce rules against China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper. And when it comes to South Korea, we\u2019ve got a trade agreement up right now, they are sending hundreds of thousands of South Korean cars into the United States. That\u2019s all good. We can only get 4,000 to 5,000 into South Korea. That is not free trade. We\u2019ve got to have a president who is going to be advocating on behalf of American businesses and American workers and I make no apology for that."}

And it is absolutely critical that we understand this is not just a challenge, it\u2019s an opportunity, because if we create a new energy economy, we can create five million new jobs, easily, here in the United States. It can be an engine that drives us into the future the same way the computer was the engine for economic growth over the last couple of decades. And we can do it, but we\u2019re going to have to make an investment. The same way the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out, for defense purposes, how to communicate, we\u2019ve got to understand that this is a national security issue, as well. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to make some investments and I\u2019ve called for investments in solar, wind, geothermal. Contrary to what Senator McCain keeps on saying, I favor nuclear power as one component of our overall energy mix. But this is another example where I think it is important to look at the record. Senator McCain and I actually agree on something. He said a while back that the big problem with energy is that for 30 years, politicians in Washington haven\u2019t done anything. What Senator McCain doesn\u2019t mention is he\u2019s been there 26 of them. And during that time, he voted 23 times against alternative fuels, 23 times. So it\u2019s easy to talk about this stuff during a campaign, but it\u2019s important for us to understand that it requires a sustained effort from the next president. One last point I want to make on energy. Senator McCain talks a lot about drilling, and that\u2019s important, but we have three percent of the world\u2019s oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world\u2019s oil. So what that means is that we can\u2019t simply drill our way out of the problem. And we\u2019re not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global warming. We\u2019re going to have to come up with alternatives, and that means that the United States government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like China that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week. We\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re giving them the energy that they need or helping them to create the energy that they need."}

I don\u2019t think the American people believe that. I will fight for oil, coal and natural gas. And the proof, the proof of whether a strategy is working or not is what the price is that you\u2019re paying at the pump. If you\u2019re paying less than you paid a year or two ago, why, then, the strategy is working. But you\u2019re paying more. When the president took office, the price of gasoline here in Nassau County was about $1.86 a gallon. Now, it\u2019s $4.00 a gallon. The price of electricity is up. If the president\u2019s energy policies are working, you\u2019re going to see the cost of energy come down. I will fight to create more energy in this country, to get America energy secure. And part of that is bringing in a pipeline of oil from Canada, taking advantage of the oil and coal we have here, drilling offshore in Alaska, drilling offshore in Virginia where the people want it. Those things will get us the energy we need."}

I\u2019d like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece. First of all, I don\u2019t have a $5 trillion tax cut. I don\u2019t have a tax cut of a scale that you\u2019re talking about. My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But I\u2019m not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people. High-income people are doing just fine in this economy. They\u2019ll do fine whether you\u2019re president or I am. The people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans. Under the president\u2019s policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. They\u2019re just being crushed. Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. This is a \u2014 this is a tax in and of itself. I\u2019ll call it the economy tax. It\u2019s been crushing. At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president. Electric rates are up. Food prices are up. Health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family. Middle-income families are being crushed. And so the question is how to get them going again. And I\u2019ve described it. It\u2019s energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business. Those are the \u2014 the cornerstones of my plan. But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I\u2019ll just note. First, education. I agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy. But our training programs right now, we\u2019ve got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. We\u2019ve got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them. The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down. And I do, both for corporations and for individuals. But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth. The third area, energy. Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up. But not due to his policies. In spite of his policies. Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half. If I\u2019m president, I\u2019ll double them, and also get the \u2014 the oil from offshore and Alaska. And I\u2019ll bring that pipeline in from Canada. And, by the way, I like coal. I\u2019m going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like it\u2019s getting crushed by your policies. I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs. And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, I\u2019m not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the \u2014 the revenues going to the government. My \u2014 my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit. But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans. And I \u2014 and to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans. So any \u2014 any language to the contrary is simply not accurate. LEHRER: Mr. President?"}

First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business. That\u2019s something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don\u2019t get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else. You know, because it sounds like you\u2019re in the business or you\u2019re aware of people in the business\u2014you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent. We are not dependent upon the Middle East. But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices. So the price of oil has been way down. And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right? We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels. And I think that\u2019s an important transition. We\u2019ve got to remain energy-independent. It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East. We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that. So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem. And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses. But I also want to be sure that we don\u2019t leave people behind. That\u2019s why I\u2019m the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out. A lot of them lost their lives. They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered our factories. I don\u2019t want to walk away from them. So we\u2019ve got to do something for them."}

Canadian oil is fine. By the way, when Senator Obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Canadians said, \u201cYes, and we\u2019ll sell our oil to China.\u201d You don\u2019t tell countries you\u2019re going to unilaterally renegotiate agreements with them. We can eliminate our dependence on foreign oil by building 45 new nuclear plants, power plants, right away. We can store and we can reprocess. Senator Obama will tell you, in the \u2014 as the extreme environmentalists do, it has to be safe. Look, we\u2019ve sailed Navy ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them. We can store and reprocess spent nuclear fuel, Senator Obama, no problem. So the point is with nuclear power, with wind, tide, solar, natural gas, with development of flex fuel, hybrid, clean coal technology, clean coal technology is key in the heartland of America that\u2019s hurting rather badly. So I think we can easily, within seven, eight, ten years, if we put our minds to it, we can eliminate our dependence on the places in the world that harm our national security if we don\u2019t achieve our independence."}

I think that this is important to come back to, with that energy policy plan again that was voted for in \u201905. When we talk about energy, we have to consider the need to do all that we can to allow this nation to become energy independent. It\u2019s a nonsensical position that we are in when we have domestic supplies of energy all over this great land. And East Coast politicians who don\u2019t allow energy-producing states like Alaska to produce these, to tap into them, and instead we\u2019re relying on foreign countries to produce for us. We\u2019re circulating about $700 billion a year into foreign countries, some who do not like America \u2014 they certainly don\u2019t have our best interests at heart \u2014 instead of those dollars circulating here, creating tens of thousands of jobs and allowing domestic supplies of energy to be tapped into and start flowing into these very, very hungry markets. Energy independence is the key to this nation\u2019s future, to our economic future, and to our national security. So when we talk about energy plans, it\u2019s not just about who got a tax break and who didn\u2019t. And we\u2019re not giving oil companies tax breaks, but it\u2019s about a heck of a lot more than that. Energy independence is the key to America\u2019s future."}

This uh \u2013 administration\u2019s record on environment is very bad. Uh \u2013 I think it\u2019s accurate to say that the uh \u2013 strip-mining law which was passed twice by the Congress \u2013 uh \u2013 and was only like two votes I believe of being overridden \u2013 would have been good for the country. The claim that it would have put hundred and forty thousand miners out of work is uh \u2013 hard to believe, when at the time Mr. Ford vetoed it, the United Mine Workers was uh \u2013 supporting the bill. And I don\u2019t think they would have supported the uh \u2013 bill had they known that they would lose a hundred and forty thousand jobs. There\u2019s been a consistent policy on the part of this administration to lower or delay enforcement of air pollution standards and water pollution standards. And under both President Nixon and Ford, monies have been impounded that would\u2019ve gone to uh \u2013 cities and others to control uh \u2013 water pollution. We have no energy policy. We, I think, are the only developed nation in the world that has no comprehensive energy policy, to permit us to plan in an orderly way how to shift from increasing the scarce uh \u2013 energy uh \u2013 forms: oil, and have research and development concentrated on the increased use of coal, which I strongly favor. The research and development to be used primary to make the coal burning uh \u2013 be clean.

And people are willing to invest capital in the brown fields don\u2019t want to do so for fear of lawsuit. I think we ought to have federal liability protection, depending upon whether or not standards have been met. The book you mentioned that Vice President Gore wrote, he also called for taxing \u2014 big energy taxes in order to clean up the environment. And now that the energy prices are high, I guess he\u2019s not advocating those big energy taxes right now. I believe we ought to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund to \u2014 with half the money going to states so states can make the right decisions for environmental quality. I think we need to have clean coal technologies. I propose $2 billion worth. By the way, I just found out the other day an interesting fact, that there is a national petroleum reserve right next to \u2014 in Prudhoe Bay that your administration opened up for exploration in that pristine area. And it was a smart move because there\u2019s gas reserves up there. We need gas pipelines to bring the gas down. Gas is a clean fuel that we can burn to \u2014 we need to make sure that if we decontrol our plants that there\u2019s mandatory \u2014 that the plants must conform to clean air standards, the grandfathered plants, that\u2019s what we did in Texas. No excuses. You must conform. In other words, there are practical things we can do. But it starts with working in a collaborative effort with states and local folks. If you own the land, every day is Earth Day. People care a lot about their land and care about their environment. Not all wisdom is in Washington, D.C. on this issue."}

First, we\u2019ve got to improve our education system and we\u2019ve made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools. We\u2019ve got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers. So now I want to hire another 100,000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now. And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people. When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent. But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States. On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we\u2019ve got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than they\u2019ve been in years. But I also believe that we\u2019ve got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments. So all of this is possible. Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code? And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments? And this is where there\u2019s a difference, because Governor Romney\u2019s central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut \u2014 on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts \u2014 that\u2019s another trillion dollars \u2014 and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn\u2019t asked for. That\u2019s $8 trillion. How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign."}

The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall. There are hundreds of thousands of them. They really don\u2019t \u2013 they\u2019re not able to control their market very well. They bring their crops in or their livestock in, many of them about the same time. They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs \u2013 a few large companies in many cases \u2013 and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place. I think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture. And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse. The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States. The automobile industry is the number one market for steel. So if the farmers\u2019 economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country. So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one. Secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance. The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh \u2013 surpluses \u2013 nine billion dollars worth. We\u2019ve had a uh \u2013 higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years. I think that this farm policy has failed. In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance. And that can only be done through governmental action. I therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported, that the federal government, after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity, attempt to bring supply and demand into balance \u2013 attempt effective production controls \u2013 so that we won\u2019t have that five or six per cent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent. I think Mr. Benson\u2019s program has failed. And I must say, after reading the Vice President\u2019s speech before the farmers, as he read mine, I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s very much different from Mr. Benson\u2019s. I don\u2019t think it provides effective governmental controls. I think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years, which was Mr. Benson\u2019s theory. I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future."}

The coal that the President mentioned \u2013 yes, we have it \u2013 and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now. The mines are closed down; there are 22000 miners out of work. Most of this is due to regulations which either interfere with the mining of it or prevent the burning of it:. With our modern technology, yes, we can burn our coal within the limits of the Clean Air Act. I think, as technology improves, we\u2019ll be able to do even better with that. The other thing is that we have only leased out \u2013 begun to explore \u2013 2% of our outer continental shelf for oil, where it is believed, by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy, that there are vast supplies yet to be found. Our Government has, in the last year or so, taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were \u2013 well, they were public lands subject to multiple use \u2013 exploration for minerals and so forth. It is believed that probably 70% of the potential oil in the United States is probably hidden in those lands, and no one is allowed to even go and explore to find out if it is there. This is particularly true of the recent efforts to shut down part of Alaska. Nuclear power: There were 36 power plants planned in this country. And let me add the word safety; it must be done with the utmost of safety. But 32 of those have given up and canceled their plans to build, and again, because Government regulations and permits, and so forth, take \u2013 make it take \u2013 more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the United States as it does to build one in Japan or in Western Europe.

And what Mike Dukakis has said is that he\u2019ll try to break down those regulatory roadblocks that you have in the regulatory agency that denies much of the passage of that natural gas to the northeast, a way, in turn, can fight against acid rain which is another threat, because it\u2019s sterilizing our lakes, it\u2019s killing our fish. And it\u2019s interesting to me to see in the resume of Senator Quayle that he brags on the fact that he\u2019s been able to fight the acid rain legislation. I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s a proper objective in trying to clean up this environment. But the greenhouse effect is one that has to be a threat to all of us, and we have to look for alternative sources of fuel. And I\u2019ve supported that very strongly. The Department of Energy is one that has cut back substantially on the study of those alternative sources of fuels. We can use other things that\u2019ll help the farmer. We can convert corn to ethanol, and I would push for that very strong. So absolutely. I\u2019ll do those things that are necessary to put the environment of our country number one. Because if we don\u2019t protect that, we\u2019ll destroy the future of our children.

Actually, I understand it pretty well. The history in Colombia right now is that labor leaders have been targeted for assassination on a fairly consistent basis and there have not been prosecutions. And what I have said, because the free trade \u2014 the trade agreement itself does have labor and environmental protections, but we have to stand for human rights and we have to make sure that violence isn\u2019t being perpetrated against workers who are just trying to organize for their rights, which is why, for example, I supported the Peruvian Free Trade Agreement which was a well-structured agreement. But I think that the important point is we\u2019ve got to have a president who understands the benefits of free trade but also is going to enforce unfair trade agreements and is going to stand up to other countries. And the last point I\u2019ll make, because we started on energy. When I talked about the automakers, they are obviously getting hammered right now. They were already having a tough time because of high gas prices. And now with the financial crisis, car dealerships are closing and people can\u2019t get car loans. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s important for us to get loan guarantees to the automakers, but we do have to hold them responsible as well to start producing the highly fuel-efficient cars of the future. And Detroit had dragged its feet too long in terms of getting that done. It\u2019s going to be one of my highest priorities because transportation accounts for about 30 percent of our total energy consumption. If we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs all across America, including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century."}

I agree with what I think is the major premise of your question, sir, that we are going to have to create a new conservation ethic in the minds of the American people. and that\u2019s simply why I proposed, 15 months ago, the emergency excise tax on gasoline that I did. I did it as a security measure to be sure, because I would rather see us reduce the consumption of imported oil than have to send American boys to fight in the Persian Gulf. But at the same time, I think it\u2019s going to take a dramatic measure of that kind to convince the American people that we will have to reduce the use of the private automobile. We simply cannot have people sitting one behind the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams going in and out of our great cities. We are going to have to resort to van pooling, to car pooling. We\u2019re going to have to develop better community transportation systems, so that with buses and light rail, we can replace the private automobile in those places where it clearly is not energy-efficient. I think that, with respect to housing, when we are consuming, even though our per capita income today is about the same as that of the Federal Republic of Germany, we are consuming about, by a factor of two, the amount of energy that they consume in that country. Surely, there are things that we can do in the retrofitting, ;n the redesign of our homes, not only of our houses, but of our commercial structures, as well, that will make it possible for us to achieve. According to one study that was published a short time ago \u2013 the Harvard Business School study \u2013 indicated that just in the commercial sector alone of the economy, we could save between 30% and 40% of the energy that we consume in this country today. So I think, yes, we will have to change in a very appreciable way, some of the lifestyles that we now enjoy."}

I support the farm bill, the 1985 farm bill and spending is moving in the right direction.

I will not go back to the way the Democrats did it and used food as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the farmers in this country.

In terms of the Third World, I support the Baker plan. I want to see market economies spring up all around the world and to the degree they do, we are succeeding.

The problem is accurately stated. No matter how strong we are economically, if we remain dependent on a source of energy that is outside our control, we\u2019re not going to be as strong as we should be. Others around the world can effectively yank our chain, and we cannot allow that to continue to happen. I\u2019m afraid that our opponent\u2019s response to this is one-sided, and it is essentially to develop the resources within the United States almost regardless of where. I\u2019m against drilling in the Arctic Refuge. This is one of the most beautiful, pristine places that the good Lord has created on earth. It happens to be within the United States of America. It\u2019s not worth it to do that for what seems to be the possibility of six months\u2019 worth of oil, seven to 12 years from now. That\u2019s not much of a response to the immediate problem that gasoline consumers and home heating oil customers are facing this winter. There are more resources within the United States that we can develop. This isn\u2019t mentioned much and appreciated much. In the last eight years drilling for gas on federal lands has gone up 60% and it\u2019s been done in an environmentally protected way. The administration has encouraged the drilling for deep gas and oil going on in the western Gulf today. The answer here is new technology that will create millions of new jobs. Let me just say this. If we can get three miles more per gallon from our cars we\u2019ll get a \u2014 we\u2019ll save 1 million barrels of oil a day, which is exactly what the refuge at its best in Alaska would produce. The choice to me is clear. We have to develop fuel cells, alternative energy, encourage people to conserve and to be efficient."}

And President Bush did some smart things at the outset, but one of the opportunities that was missed was, when he spoke to the American people, he said, \u201cGo out and shop.\u201d That wasn\u2019t the kind of call to service that I think the American people were looking for. And so it\u2019s important to understand that the \u2014 I think the American people are hungry for the kind of leadership that is going to tackle these problems not just in government, but outside of government. And let\u2019s take the example of energy, which we already spoke about. There is going to be the need for each and every one of us to start thinking about how we use energy. I believe in the need for increased oil production. We\u2019re going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling. It includes telling the oil companies, that currently have 68 million acres that they\u2019re not using, that either you use them or you lose them. We\u2019re going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy. But each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes, in our buildings. And one of the things I want to do is make sure that we\u2019re providing incentives so that you can buy a fuel efficient car that\u2019s made right here in the United States of America, not in Japan or South Korea, making sure that you are able to weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient.

I think the young people of America are especially interested in how they can serve, and that\u2019s one of the reasons why I\u2019m interested in doubling the Peace Corps, making sure that we are creating a volunteer corps all across this country that can be involved in their community, involved in military service, so that military families and our troops are not the only ones bearing the burden of renewing America.

We have demanded that the American people sacrifice, and they have done very well. As a matter of fact, we\u2019re importing today about one-third less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago. We\u2019ve had a 25% reduction since the first year I was in office. At the same time, as I have said earlier, we have added about nine million net new jobs in that period of time \u2013 a record never before achieved. Also, the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors: One is conservation, which requires sacrifice, and the other one, increase in production of American energy, which is going along very well \u2013 more coal this year than ever before in American history, more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history. The new economic revitalization program that we have in mind, which will be implemented next year, would result in tax credits which would let business invest in new tools and new factories to create even more new jobs \u2013 about one million in the next two years. And we also have planned a youth employment program which would encompass 600,000 jobs for young people. This has already passed the House, and it has an excellent prospect to pass the Senate."}

Now, I feel very strongly that we ought to be doing more for the American farmer and what we\u2019ve seen under this administration is neglect of that farmer. We\u2019ve seen them drive 220,000 farmers off the farm. They seem to think the answer is move them to town, but we ought not to be doing that. What you have seen them do is cut the farm assistance for the rural areas by over 50 percent. We\u2019re seeing rural hospitals close all over the country because of this kind of an administration. We\u2019ve seen an administration that has lost much of our market abroad, because they have not had a trade policy. We saw our market loss by some 40 percent. And that\u2019s one of the reasons that we\u2019ve seen the cost of the farm program, which was only about two and a half billion dollars when they took office, now go to about $25 billion. Now, we can bring that kind of a cost down and get more to market prices if we\u2019ll have a good trade policy. I was in January visiting with Mr. Takeshita, the new Prime Minister of Japan. I said, \u201cYou\u2019re paying five times as much for beef as we pay for our in country \u2013 pay for it in our country, six times as much for rice. You have a $60 billion trade surplus with us.

And the world needs a strong America, and it is stronger now than when I came into office. Because we ended the war in Iraq, we were able to refocus our attention on not only the terrorist threat, but also beginning a transition process in Afghanistan. It also allowed us to refocus on alliances and relationships that had been neglected for a decade. And Governor Romney, our alliances have never been stronger, in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel, where we have unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation, including dealing with the Iranian threat. But what we also have been able to do is position ourselves so we can start rebuilding America, and that\u2019s what my plan does. Making sure that we\u2019re bringing manufacturing back to our shores so that we\u2019re creating jobs here, as we\u2019ve done with the auto industry, not rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas. Making sure that we\u2019ve got the best education system in the world, including retraining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow. Doing everything we can to control our own energy. We\u2019ve cut our oil imports to the lowest level in two decades because we\u2019ve developed oil and natural gas. But we also have to develop clean energy technologies that will allow us to cut our exports in half by 2020. That\u2019s the kind of leadership that we need to show. And we\u2019ve got to make sure that we reduce our deficit. Unfortunately, Governor Romney\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t do it. We\u2019ve got to do it in a responsible way by cutting out spending we don\u2019t need, but also asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more.

Well first, I\u2019m very proud of our record on the environment and on conservation. According to all of the best estimates, our, our air and land are cleaner than any time ever recorded. And our water is among the cleanest in the world. And just a little while ago, the president signed the Outdoors Act, the largest investment in our public lands and public parks in 100 years. So, President Trump has made a commitment to conservation and to the environment. Now with regard to climate change, the climate is changing. But the issue is, what\u2019s the cause and what do we do about it. President Trump has made it clear that we\u2019re going to continue to listen to the science. Now Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, would put us back in the Paris Climate Accord. They\u2019d impose the Green New Deal, which would crush American energy, would increase the energy cost of American families in their homes and literally would crush American jobs. President Trump and I believe that the progress that we have made in a cleaner environment has been happening precisely because we have a strong free market economy. You know what\u2019s remarkable is the United States has reduced CO2 more than the countries that are still in the Paris Climate Accord, but we\u2019ve done it through innovation. And we\u2019ve done it through natural gas and fracking, which, Senator, the American people can go look at the record. I know Joe Biden says otherwise now, as you do, but the both of you repeatedly committed to abolishing fossil fuel and banning fracking."}

Rather than imposing sanctions or military interventions, it seeks to address global challenges through collaboration and mutual understanding.\n3. **Progressive Economic Policy**: In contrast to conservative economic values, this view supports active government involvement in the economy.

It prioritizes long-term social change and transformation, valuing participatory, inclusive approaches over results-driven pragmatism, even if they require broader shifts in societal structures.\n5. **Nonpartisanship and Inclusive Governance**: Rather than strict partisanship, this pole emphasizes the importance of transcending political identities to work collaboratively. It values nonpartisan approaches, where policies are evaluated on their social benefits rather than ideological alignment. It downplays party identity in favor of inclusive, collective governance that reflects diverse societal interests and voices.\n6. **Community-Centered Crisis Response**: This viewpoint emphasizes grassroots, community-led responses to crises rather than top-down leadership.

I think the Congress should have uh \u2013 added another $10 billion reduction in personal income taxes, including the increase of personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars. And Congress could have done that if the budget committees of the Congress, and the Congress as a whole, had not increased the spending that I recommended in the budget. I\u2019m sure that you know that in the resolutions passed by the Congress, that have added about $17 billion in more spending, by the Congress over the budget that I recommended. So I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending. Now this tax bill \u2013 that hasn\u2019t reached the White House yet, but is expected in a day or two \u2013 it\u2019s about fifteen hundred pages. It has some good provisions in it.

I never suggested that compulsory arbitration was the solution for national emergency disputes. I\u2019m opposed to that, was opposed to it in October, 1958. I have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act. I don\u2019t know what other weapons the Vice President is talking about. I\u2019m talking about giving him four or five tools \u2013 not only the fact-finding committee that he now has under the injunction provision, not only the injunction, but also the power of the fact-finding commission to make recommendations \u2013 recommendations which would not be binding, but nevertheless would have great force of public opinion behind them. One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure. There might be others. By the president having five powers \u2013 four or five powers \u2013 and he only has very limited powers today, neither the company nor the union would be sure which power would be used; and therefore, there would be a greater incentive on both sides to reach an agreement themselves without taking it to the government. The difficulty now is the president\u2019s course is quite limited. He can set up a fact-finding committee. The fact-finding committee\u2019s powers are limited. He can provide an injunction if there\u2019s a national emergency for eighty days, then the strike can go on; and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the Congress. This is a difficult and sensitive matter. But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do. He could leave the parties in doubt as to which one he would use; and therefore there would be incentive, instead of as now \u2013 the steel companies were ready to take the strike because they felt the injunction of eighty days would break the union, which didn\u2019t happen."}

And the Republicans in recent years \u2013 not only in the last twenty-five years, but in the last eight years \u2013 have opposed housing, opposed care for the aged, opposed federal aid to education, opposed minimum wage and I think that record tells something."}

As a matter of fact, the statement that Senator Kennedy made was that \u2013 to the effect that there were trigger-happy Republicans, that my stand on Quemoy and Matsu was an indication of trigger-happy Republicans. I resent that comment. I resent it because th- it\u2019s an implication that Republicans have been trigger-happy and, therefore, would lead this nation into war. I would remind Senator Kennedy of the past fifty years. I would ask him to name one Republican president who led this nation into war. There were three Democratic presidents who led us into war. I do not mean by that that one party is a war party and the other party is a peace party. But I do say that any statement to the effect that the Republican party is trigger-happy is belied by the record. We had a war when we came into power in 1953. We got rid of that; we\u2019ve kept out of other wars; and certainly that doesn\u2019t indicate that we\u2019re trigger-happy. We\u2019ve been strong, but we haven\u2019t been trigger-happy. As far as Berlin is concerned, there isn\u2019t any question about the necessity of defending Berlin; the rights of people there to be free; and there isn\u2019t any question about what the united American people \u2013 Republicans and Democrats alike \u2013 would do in the event there were an attempt by the Communists to take over Berlin."}

These debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonight\u2019s will last 90 minutes, following detailed rules of engagement worked out by representatives of the candidates. I have agreed to enforce the rules they have devised for themselves to the best of my ability. The questions tonight will be divided between foreign and domestic policy, but the specific topics were chosen by me. The candidates have not been told what they are. The rules - For each question, there can be only a two- minute response, a 90-second rebuttal and, at my discretion, a discussion extension of one minute. A green light will come on when 30 seconds remain in any given answer, yellow at 15 seconds, red at five seconds, and then flashing red means time\u2019s up. There\u2019s also a back-up buzzer system, if needed. Candidates may not direct questions to one another. There will be two-minute closing statements, but no opening statements. There is an audience here in the hall, but they have been instructed to remain silent throughout. The order of the first question was determined by the candidates in advance, and the first one goes to Vice President Cheney. Vice President Cheney, there have been new developments in Iraq, especially having to do with the administration\u2019s handling. Paul Bremer, the former head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, gave a speech in which he said that we have never had enough troops on the ground, or we\u2019ve never had enough troops on the ground. Donald Rumsfeld said he has not seen any hard evidence of a link between Al Qaida and Saddam Hussein. Was this approved \u2014 of a report that you requested that you received a week ago that showed there was no connection between Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and Saddam Hussein?","Dimension Description":"Dimension 6 - Negative Pole - t001879 - Dimension Description:\nThe opposite ideological components would reflect an emphasis on openness, social investment, global cooperation, and decentralized decision-making, valuing collective well-being over rigid governmental control.

It\u2019s a very important event, and they\u2019ve done a superb job of putting it together. It\u2019s important to look at all of our developments in Iraq within the broader context of the global war on terror. And, after 9\/11, it became clear that we had to do several things to have a successful strategy to win the global war on terror, specifically that we had to go after the terrorists wherever we might find them, that we also had to go after state sponsors of terror, those who might provide sanctuary or safe harbor for terror. And we also then finally had to stand up democracies in their stead afterwards, because that was the only way to guarantee that these states would not again become safe harbors for terror or for the development of deadly weapons. Concern about Iraq specifically focused on the fact that Saddam Hussein had been, for years, listed on the state sponsor of terror, that they he had established relationships with Abu Nidal, who operated out of Baghdad; he paid $25,000 to the families of suicide bombers; and he had an established relationship with Al Qaida. Specifically, look at George Tenet, the CIA director\u2019s testimony before the Committee on Foreign Relations two years ago when he talked about a 10-year relationship. The effort that we\u2019ve mounted with respect to Iraq focused specifically on the possibility that this was the most likely nexus between the terrorists and weapons of mass destruction. The biggest threat we faced today is the possibility of terrorists smuggling a nuclear weapon or a biological agent into one of our own cities and threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans. What we did in Iraq was exactly the right thing to do. If I had it to recommend all over again, I would recommend exactly the same course of action. The world is far safer today because Saddam Hussein is in jail, his government is no longer in power. And we did exactly the right thing."}

I said at the time that we had to hold the lid an federal spending, that for every dollar of a tax reduction we had to have an equal reduction in federal expenditures \u2013 a one-for-one proposition. And I recommended that to the Congress with a budget ceiling of three hundred and ninety-five billion dollars, and that would have permitted us to have a $25 billion tax reduction. In my tax reduction program for middle-income taxpayers, I recommended that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person. That would mean, of course, that for a family of four that that family would have a thousand dollars more personal exemption \u2013 money that they could spend for their own purposes, money that the government wouldn\u2019t have to spend. But if we keep the lid on federal spending, which I think we can \u2013 with the help of the Congress, we can justify fully a $28 billion tax reduction. In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending. For the last ten years the budget of the United States has grown from uh \u2013 about 11 percent per year. We can\u2019t afford that kind of growth in federal spending. And in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half \u2013 a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one-half percent. With that kind of limitation, on federal spending, we can fully justify the tax reductions that I have proposed. And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that we\u2019ll get more revenue and we\u2019ll have a more prosperous economy."}

Those tapes are in the jurisdiction of the courts and I have no right to say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d But all the committees, the attorney general, the special prosecutor, all of them have given me a clean bill of health. I think the matter is settled once and for all."}

Secondly, I think the question is uh \u2013 what are the programs that we advocate, what is the party record that we lead? I come out of the Democratic party, which in this century has produced Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, and which supported and sustained these programs which I\u2019ve discussed tonight. Mr. Nixon comes out of the Republican party. He was nominated by it. And it is a fact that through most of these last twenty-five years the Republican leadership has opposed federal aid for education, medical care for the aged, development of the Tennessee Valley, development of our natural resources. I think Mr. Nixon is an effective leader of his party. I hope he would grant me the same. The question before us is: which point of view and which party do we want to lead the United States?"}

You were the first senate co-sponsor of the Green New Deal. And while Joe Biden denied the Green New Deal, Susan, thank you for pointing out, the Green New Deal is on their campaign website. And as USA TODAY said, it\u2019s essentially the same plan as you co-sponsored with AOC when she submitted it in the Senate. And you just heard the senator say that she\u2019s going to resubmit America to the Paris Climate Accord. Look, the American people have always cherished our environment.

One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code. And she could have done this years ago, by the way. She\u2019s a United States\u2014she was a United States senator. She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code. Well, why didn\u2019t she change it? Why didn\u2019t you change it when you were a senator? The reason you didn\u2019t is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do. And I do. You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change. But you wouldn\u2019t change it, because all of these people give you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump. But\u2014and I say that about a lot of things. You know, I\u2019ve heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years. \u201cI wish you would have done this.\u201d But she\u2019s been there for 30 years she\u2019s been doing this stuff. She never changed. And she never will change. She never will change. We\u2019re getting rid of carried interest provisions. I\u2019m lowering taxes actually, because I think it\u2019s so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving\u2014massive corporations and little ones, little ones can\u2019t form. We\u2019re getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes. But we\u2019re bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent. We\u2019re cutting taxes for the middle class. And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class. And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks. You can look at me. She\u2019s raising your taxes really high. And what that\u2019s going to do is a disaster for the country. But she is raising your taxes and I\u2019m lowering your taxes. That in itself is a big difference. We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. There\u2019s no growth. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it\u2019s like a national catastrophe. We\u2019re down at 1 percent. And that\u2019s, like, no growth. And we\u2019re going lower, in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world. And I\u2019m bringing them down to one of the lower in the world.

First of all, 30,000 people being killed by their government is a humanitarian disaster. Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly right now. Syria is Iran\u2019s only ally in the Arab world. It\u2019s their route to the sea. It\u2019s the route for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally, Israel. And so seeing Syria remove Assad is a very high priority for us. Number two, seeing a \u2014 a replacement government being responsible people is critical for us. And finally, we don\u2019t want to have military involvement there. We don\u2019t want to get drawn into a military conflict. And so the right course for us, is working through our partners and with our own resources, to identify responsible parties within Syria, organize them, bring them together in a \u2014 in a form of \u2014 if not government, a form of \u2014 of \u2014 of council that can take the lead in Syria. And then make sure they have the arms necessary to defend themselves. We do need to make sure that they don\u2019t have arms that get into the \u2014 the wrong hands. Those arms could be used to hurt us down the road. We need to make sure as well that we coordinate this effort with our allies, and particularly with \u2014 with Israel. But the Saudi\u2019s and the Qatari, and \u2014 and the Turks are all very concerned about this. They\u2019re willing to work with us. We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria, making sure that the \u2014 the insurgent there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed, are people who will be the responsible parties. Recognize \u2014 I believe that Assad must go. I believe he will go. But I believe \u2014 we want to make sure that we have the relationships of friendship with the people that take his place, steps that in the years to come we see Syria as a \u2014 as a friend, and Syria as a responsible party in the Middle East. This \u2014 this is a critical opportunity for America. And what I\u2019m afraid of is we\u2019ve watched over the past year or so, first the president saying, well we\u2019ll let the U.N. deal with it. And Assad \u2014 excuse me, Kofi Annan came in and said we\u2019re going to try to have a ceasefire. That didn\u2019t work.

The fact is that we will not enjoy real stability in the Middle East until Saddam Hussein is gone. The Gulf War was a great victory. And incidentally, Al Gore and I were two of the ten Democrats in the Senate who crossed party lines to support President Bush and Secretary Cheney in that war. We\u2019re both very proud we did that. But, the war did not end with a total victory. Saddam Hussein remained there. As a result, we have had almost ten years now of instability.

But let me respond to what you said. I agree that too many incumbent politicians in Washington in both parties have consistently opposed campaign finance reform. That was certainly the case from the minute I got there. So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested \u2014 a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission. And I shook hands with him on it and I appointed my members, and the commission never met. And then Senator Dole\u2019s ardent supporters, Senator McCain, who\u2019s out there today, along with Senator Feingold, supported, sponsored a campaign finance reform proposal. I strongly supported it. And members of Senator Dole\u2019s own party in the Senate killed it. And he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill. So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have. And I hope we can finally get it in the next session of Congress, because we need it badly."}

Senator Bentsen voted against Gramm-Rudman, the very tool that has been used to bring the Federal budget deficit down. We\u2019re going to need all the tools possible to bring this Federal budget deficit down. We need the tools of a line item veto. A line item veto that 43 governors in this country have, but not the President of the United States. The President of the United States needs to have a line item veto. When Congress goes ahead and puts into appropriations bills unrequested and unnecessary spending, let the President put a line through that, send it back to the Congress and let the Congress vote on it again.

For example, after my first trip abroad \u2013 abroad, I strongly recommended that we increase our exchange programs particularly as they related to exchange of persons of leaders in the labor field and in the information field. After my trip to South America, I made recommendations that a separate inter-American lending agency be set up which the South American nations would like much better than a lend- than to participate in the lending agencies which treated all the countries of the world the same. Uh \u2013 I have made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian refugee situation which were adopted, not only by the President but some of them were enacted into law by the Congress.

Here\u2019s how the reverse ideologies might look:\n1. **Governmental Flexibility and Social Investment**: Instead of strict oversight and fiscal conservatism, this ideology favors a flexible, responsive government that prioritizes social investment over budgetary restrictions. It supports proactive spending in social programs, environmental initiatives, and public welfare, emphasizing adaptability over rigid accountability and a willingness to take financial risks for long-term social benefits.\n2. **Global Engagement and Cooperative Security**: This perspective values diplomacy and multilateral cooperation over protectionism and military assertiveness. It advocates for international partnerships to address security issues, focusing on negotiation and peace-building with other nations, including traditional adversaries. Rather than imposing sanctions or military interventions, it seeks to address global challenges through collaboration and mutual understanding.\n3. **Progressive Economic Policy**: In contrast to conservative economic values, this view supports active government involvement in the economy. It favors progressive taxation, increased government spending on social welfare, and programs aimed at reducing inequality. There\u2019s an emphasis on reducing reliance on market forces alone, viewing government assistance and spending as essential for a balanced and fair economy.\n4. **Idealism in Governance**: This ideology promotes value-based governance with an emphasis on ideals such as equity, justice, and inclusivity, even if the results are not immediately measurable. It prioritizes long-term social change and transformation, valuing participatory, inclusive approaches over results-driven pragmatism, even if they require broader shifts in societal structures.\n5. **Nonpartisanship and Inclusive Governance**: Rather than strict partisanship, this pole emphasizes the importance of transcending political identities to work collaboratively. It values nonpartisan approaches, where policies are evaluated on their social benefits rather than ideological alignment. It downplays party identity in favor of inclusive, collective governance that reflects diverse societal interests and voices.\n6. **Community-Centered Crisis Response**: This viewpoint emphasizes grassroots, community-led responses to crises rather than top-down leadership. It advocates for empowering local organizations, community leaders, and civic groups to address challenges collaboratively, focusing on shared decision-making and public input in times of crisis. The goal is to build resilient communities through cooperation rather than relying on authoritative, decisive moves from national leaders.\nIn summary, this reversed dimension would emphasize **flexibility in government, global cooperation, progressive economic involvement, ideal-driven governance, nonpartisan inclusivity, and community empowerment in crisis management**. It reflects a philosophy of open governance, social responsibility, and collective solutions over nationalistic, security-focused, and fiscally conservative approaches.","Text":"Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney\u2019s going to have a busy first day, because he\u2019s also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as you\u2019re sitting down with them.

That\u2019s how we cut taxes for middle- class families and small businesses. That\u2019s how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasn\u2019t advancing that cause. That\u2019s how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world. That\u2019s how we repealed \u201cdon\u2019t ask\/don\u2019t tell.\u201d That\u2019s how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to wind down the war in Afghanistan.

I want to get to Medicare in a second. Social Security is not that tough. We know what the problems are, my friends, and we know what the fixes are. We\u2019ve got to sit down together across the table. It\u2019s been done before. I saw it done with our \u2014 our wonderful Ronald Reagan, a conservative from California, and the liberal Democrat Tip O\u2019Neill from Massachusetts. That\u2019s what we need more of, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done in Washington. Senator Obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue. I\u2019ve taken them on. I\u2019m not too popular sometimes with my own party, much less his. So Medicare, it\u2019s going to be a little tougher. It\u2019s going to be a little tougher because we\u2019re talking about very complex and difficult issues. My friends, what we have to do with Medicare is have a commission, have the smartest people in America come together, come up with recommendations, and then, like the base-closing commission idea we had, then we should have Congress vote up or down. Let\u2019s not let them fool with it anymore. There\u2019s too much special interests and too many lobbyists working there. So let\u2019s have \u2014 and let\u2019s have the American people say, \u201cFix it for us.\u201d Now, just back on this \u2014 on this tax, you know, again, it\u2019s back to our first question here about rhetoric and record. Senator Obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts. That\u2019s his record. When he ran for the United States Senate from Illinois, he said he would have a middle-income tax cut. You know he came to the Senate and never once proposed legislation to do that? So let\u2019s look at our record. I\u2019ve fought higher taxes. I have fought excess spending. I have fought to reform government. Let\u2019s look at our records, my friends, and then listen to my vision for the future of America. And we\u2019ll get our economy going again. And our best days are ahead of us."}

If you look back over the last eight years, the most significant accomplishments of this administration in which Al Gore was centrally involved were the result, most of them, of bipartisan agreements. After all, the Welfare Reform Act, which Al Gore promised to lead the effort on to get people off of welfare to set time limits, to get people to enjoy the dignity of work. That was a bipartisan act that was adopted. The Anti-Crime Act that has helped to lower crime more than 20% in our country was also bipartisan. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 which was critical to getting our economy to the point and our government to the point of unprecedented surplus we enjoy today also was bipartisan, and Al Gore was involved.

I\u2019ve been thinking about it. I want to explain what my thoughts have been. Maybe I should begin this answer by going back to the beginning of the country and the Declaration of Independence which says there at the outset that all of us are created equal and that we\u2019re endowed not by any bunch of politicians or philosophers, but by our Creator, with those inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. At the beginning of our history, that promise that ideal was not realized or experienced by all Americans, but over time since then we have extended the orbit of that promise. In our time at the frontier of that effort is extending those kinds of rights to gay and lesbian Americans who are citizens of this country and children of the same awesome God just as much as any of the rest of us are. That\u2019s why I have been an original co-sponsor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act which aims to prevent gay and lesbian Americans who are otherwise qualified from being discriminated against in the workplace. And I\u2019ve sponsored other pieces of legislation and taken other actions that carry out that ideal. The question you pose is a difficult one for this reason. It confronts or challenges the traditional notion of marriage as being limited to a heterosexual couple, which I support. I must say I\u2019m thinking about this, because I have friends who are in gay and lesbian partnerships who said to me, isn\u2019t it fair.

But as an individual with an educational background, and also a parent, I have seen a lot of instances where the parents are unresponsive to the teachers or flat out uninvolved in their child\u2019s education. How do you intend to not only hold the teachers and schools accountable but also hold parents accountable?","Dimension Description":"Dimension 6 - Positive Pole - t002261 - Dimension Description:\n1. **Minimal Accountability and Limited Standardization**: Instead of rigorous standardized testing, this ideology would oppose excessive measurement, advocating that schools and teachers should not be strictly held accountable through testing. It favors flexibility over standardization, trusting individual educators and institutions to operate without enforced accountability measures, thus valuing educational diversity and autonomy over uniformity.\n2. **Education as a Personal Investment**: Rather than emphasizing equal access, this viewpoint regards education as a personal or family responsibility, where access to quality education is determined by individual means rather than publicly funded equity. It suggests that resources should not be redistributed for equal access, viewing private schooling or homeschooling as viable, self-sustained alternatives for those who can afford it.\n3. **Local Control without Federal Support**: This approach favors complete local control, viewing federal intervention as unnecessary and potentially intrusive. It believes that communities and local school boards are better positioned to address their needs without reliance on federal funding or oversight, advocating for a minimal role for the federal government in education.\n4. **Market-Driven Teacher Recruitment and Minimal Regulation**: Opposing centralized hiring policies, this ideology emphasizes market dynamics to attract teachers, with fewer regulations and performance-based pay rather than government-provided incentives.

I\u2019d like to start by telling you what my vision is. I see a day in the United States of America where all of our public schools are considered excellent, world class. Where there are no failing schools, where the classrooms are small enough in size, number of students, so that the teacher can spend enough one-on-one time with each student. Now that means recruiting new teachers for the public schools. It means in my plan hiring bonuses to get 100,000 new teachers in the public schools within the next four years. It means also helping local school districts that sometimes find the parents of school age children outvoted on bond issues, to give them some help with interest-free bonding authority so that we can build new schools and modernize the classrooms. We need to give teachers the training and professional development that they need, including a paid time off to go visit the classroom of a master teacher to pick up some new skills. I want to give every middle-class family a $10,000 a year tax deduction for college tuition so that middle-class families will always be able to send their kids on to college. I want to work for universal free school because we know from all the studies that the youngsters learn, kids learn more in the first few years of life than any where else. Now, I said there was a contrast. Governor Bush is for vouchers, and in his plan he proposes to drain more money, more taxpayer money out of the public schools for private school vouchers than all of the money that he proposes in his entire budget for public schools themselves. And only one in 20 students would be eligible for these vouchers, and they wouldn\u2019t even pay the full tuition to private school. I think that\u2019s a mistake. I don\u2019t think we should give up on the private schools and leave kids trapped in failing schools. I think we \u2014 I think we should make it the number one priority to make our schools the best in the world, all of them."}

I think the governor may not have heard what I said clearly. The voluntary national testing is in addition to the mandatory testing that we require of states. All schools, all school districts, students themselves, and required teacher testing, which goes a step farther than Governor Bush has been willing to go. Here are a couple of differences, though, Jim. Governor Bush is in favor of vouchers which take taxpayer money away from public schools and give them to private schools that are not accountable for how the money is used and don\u2019t have to take all applicants. Now, private schools play a great role in our society. All of our children have gone to both public schools and private schools. But I don\u2019t think private schools should have a right to take taxpayer money away from public schools at a time when Caley Ellis is standing in that classroom. Let me give you another example. I went to a school in Dade County, Florida where the facilities are so overcrowded the children have to eat lunch in shifts with the first shift for lunch starting at 9:30 in the morning. Look, this is a funding crisis all around the country. There are fewer parents of school-age children as a percentage of the voting population and there is the largest generation of students ever. We\u2019re in an information age when learning is more important than ever. 90% of our kids go to public schools. We have to make it the number one priority. Modernize our schools, reduce class size, recruit new teachers, give every child a chance to learn with one-on-one time in a quality \u2014 high-quality, safe school. If it\u2019s a failing school, shut it down and reopen it under a new principal with a turnaround team of specialists the way Governor Jim Hunt does in North Carolina. Here is another difference. The governor, if it\u2019s a failing school, would leave the children in that failing school for three years and then give a little bit of money to the parents, a down payment on a down payment for private school tuition, and pretend that that would be enough for them to go out and go to a private school. It\u2019s an illusion."}

This race is about values, it\u2019s about change, it\u2019s about giving choices to the American people. And education is my number one priority, because I think that it\u2019s the most important big major change that we can bring in our country. I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students. I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also. The difference is that while my plan starts with new accountability and maintains local control, it doesn\u2019t stop there. Because I want to give new choices to parents. To send their kids to college with a $10,000 tax deduction for college tuition per child per year. I want to reduce the size of the classrooms in this country. For one basic reason, so that students can get more one-on-one time with teachers. And the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers. I\u2019ve a plan in my budget to recruit 100,000 new, highly qualified teachers and to help local school districts build new schools. I think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and pre-school. Now, here is how that connects with all the rest of what we\u2019ve been talking about. If you have \u2014 if you squander the surplus on a huge tax cut that goes mostly to those at the top, then you can\u2019t make education the top priority. If the tax cut is your number one, two, three and four priority, you can\u2019t do education. You can\u2019t do both. You have to choose.

I mentioned before that the local communities are having a harder time passing bond issues.

It\u2019s ironic that there are now \u2014 there is now a smaller percentage of the voters made up of parents with children than ever in American history because of the aging of our population, but at the same time we\u2019ve got the largest generation of students in public schools ever. More than 90% of America\u2019s children go to public schools. And it\u2019s the largest number ever this year and they\u2019ll break the record next year and every year for ten years running. We\u2019ve got to do something about this. And local \u2014 it\u2019s not enough to leave it up to the local school districts. They\u2019re not able to do it and our future depends upon it.

And again, I want to make it possible for all middle-class families to send their kids to college and more Pell grants for those who are in the lower income groups also, and then I want to make sure that we have job training on top of that and lifelong learning, but it all starts with the public school teachers. My proposal gives $10,000 hiring bonuses for those teachers who are \u2014 who get certified to teach in the areas where they\u2019re most needed. Now, accountability, we basically agree on accountability. My plan requires testing of all students. It also requires something that Governor Bush\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t.

But I do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do. Now we tried to do this under President Bush. He put forward No Child Left Behind. Unfortunately, they left the money behind for No Child Left Behind. And local school districts end up having more of a burden, a bunch of unfunded mandates, the same kind of thing that happened with special education where we did the right thing by saying every school should provide education to kids with special needs, but we never followed through on the promise of funding, and that left local school districts very cash-strapped. So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support. Senator McCain and I actually agree on two things that he just mentioned. Charter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions. I think it\u2019s important to foster competition inside the public schools. And we also agree on the need for making sure that if we have bad teachers that they are swiftly \u2014 after given an opportunity to prove themselves, if they can\u2019t hack it, then we need to move on because our kids have to have their best future. Where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers \u2014 give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system. And I also have to disagree on Senator McCain\u2019s record when it comes to college accessibility and affordability. Recently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didn\u2019t seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was, well, you know, we can\u2019t give money to every interest group that comes along. I don\u2019t think America\u2019s youth are interest groups, I think they\u2019re our future. And this is an example of where we are going to have to prioritize. We can\u2019t say we\u2019re going to do things and then not explain in concrete terms how we\u2019re going to pay for it.

And the first word you need to say in every city and state, and just draw a line in the sand, is public schools exist for the benefit of the children. You\u2019re going to see a lot of people fall over it, because any time you\u2019re spending $199 billion dollars a year, somebody\u2019s getting it. And the children get lost in the process. So that\u2019s step one. Keep in mind in 1960, when our schools were the envy of the world, we were spending $16 billion on them; now we spend more than any other nation in the world \u2014 199 billion a year \u2014 and rank at the bottom of the industrialized world in terms of education achievement. One more time you\u2019ve bought a front-row box seat and got a third-rate performance. This is a government that is not serving you. By and large it should be local \u2014 the more local, the better. Interesting phenomenon: small towns have good schools, big cities have terrible schools. The best people in a small town will serve on the school board; you get into big cities, it\u2019s political patronage, stepping stones \u2014 you get the job, give your relatives a janitor\u2019s job at $57,000 a year, more than the teachers make, and with luck they clean the cafeteria once a week. Now, you\u2019re paying for that. Those schools belong to you. And we put up with that. Now, as long as we put up with that, that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to get. And these folks are just dividing up 199 billion bucks and the children get lost. If I could wish for one thing for great public schools, it would be a strong family unit in every home \u2014 nothing will ever replace that. You say, well, gee, what are you going to do about that? Well, the White House is a bully pulpit, and I think we ought to be pounding on the table every day. There\u2019s nothing \u2014 the most efficient unit of government the world will ever know is a strong loving family unit. Next thing. You need small schools, not big schools. In a little school everybody is somebody; individualism is very important. These big factories? Everybody told me they were cost-effective. I did a study on it; they\u2019re cost- ineffective. 5000 students \u2014 why is a high school that big? One reason. Sooner or later you get 11 more boys that can run like the devil that weigh 250 pounds and they might win district. Now, that has nothing to do with learning. Secondly, across Texas, typically half of the school day was non-academic pursuits \u2014 in one place it was 35%. In Texas you could have unlimited absences to go to livestock shows. Found a boy \u2014 excuse me, but this gives the flavor \u2014 a boy in Houston kept a chicken in the bathtub in downtown Houston and missed 65 days going to livestock shows. Finally had to come back to school, the chicken lost its feathers. That\u2019s the only way we got him back. (Laughter) Now, that\u2019s your tax money being wasted. Now, neighborhood schools. It is terrible to bus tiny little children across town. And it is particularly terrible to take poor tiny little children and wait until the first grade and bus them across town to Mars, where the children know their numbers, know their letters, have had every advantage. At the end of the first day, that little child wants out. I\u2019ll close on this. You\u2019ve got to have world class teachers, world class books. If you ever got close to how textbooks were selected, you wouldn\u2019t want to go back the second day. I don\u2019t have time to tell you the stories."}

Seventy percent of my state\u2019s money goes to the public schools, and I was really honored when Time magazine said that our schools have shown more improvement than any other state in the country except one other \u2014 they named 2 states showing real strides forward in the 80s. So I care a lot about this, and I\u2019ve spent countless hours in schools. But let me start with what you said. I agree with some of what Mr. Bush said, but it\u2019s nowhere near enough. We live in a world where what you earn depends on what you can learn, where the average 18- year-old will change jobs 8 times in a lifetime and where none of us can promise any of you that what you now do for a living is absolutely safe from now on. Nobody running can promise that, there\u2019s too much change in the world. So what should we do? Let me reel some things off real quick, because you said you wanted specifics. Number one, under my program we would provide matching funds to states to teach everybody with a job to read in the next 5 years and give everybody with a job the chance to get a high school diploma, in big places on the job. Number 2, we would provide 2-year apprenticeship programs to high school graduates who don\u2019t go to college. And community colleges are on the job. Number three, we\u2019d open the doors to college education to high school graduates without regard to income. They could borrow the money and pay it back as a percentage of their income or with a couple of years of service to our nation here at home. Number 4, we would fully fund the Head Start program to get little kids off to a good start. And, 5, I would have an aggressive program of school reform, more choices \u2014 I favor public schools or these new charter schools \u2014 we can talk about that if you want. I don\u2019t think we should spend tax money on private schools. But I favor public school choice, and I favor radical decentralization in giving more power to better-trained principals and teachers with parent councils to control their schools.

There\u2019s no doubt that we have achieved equal access to schools in America after a long and difficult and terrible struggle. But what is the advantage in a low income area of sending a child to a failed school and that being your only choice? So choice and competition amongst schools is one of the key elements that\u2019s already been proven in places in like New Orleans and New York City and other places, where we have charter schools, where we take good teachers and we reward them and promote them. And we find bad teachers another line of work. And we have to be able to give parents the same choice, frankly, that Senator Obama and Mrs. Obama had and Cindy and I had to send our kids to the school \u2014 their kids to the school of their choice. Charter schools aren\u2019t the only answer, but they\u2019re providing competition. They are providing the kind of competitions that have upgraded both schools \u2014 types of schools. Now, throwing money at the problem is not the answer. You will find that some of the worst school systems in America get the most money per student. So I believe that we need to reward these good teachers. We need to encourage programs such as Teach for America and Troops to Teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which \u2014 or have the certification that some are required in some states. Look, we must improve education in this country. As far as college education is concerned, we need to make those student loans available. We need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet. We need to have full student loan program for in-state tuition. And we certainly need to adjust the certain loan eligibility to inflation."}

Uh \u2013 I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh \u2013 pay teachers\u2019 salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers\u2019 salaries \u2013 at least that\u2019s the way I read his remarks. Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers\u2019 salaries? Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then? Why do I take it now? We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers\u2019 salaries. We need higher teachers\u2019 salaries. But we also want our education to be free of federal control. When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach. I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession. There is another point that should be made. I favor higher salaries for teachers. But, as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference, the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction, which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers\u2019 salaries. I should also point out this; once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers\u2019 salaries, your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should. I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility. Teachers\u2019 salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries. This is not enough; it should be more. But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program. My objection here is not the cost in dollars. My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have."}

I wish I knew the law because I would darn sure sign it. I wish I knew the law that said all of us would be good parents. One of the things the next president must do is to remind people that if we are going to have a responsible period in America, that each of us must love our children with all our heart and all our soul. I happened to believe strong accountability encourages parental involvement, though. I think when you measure and post results on the Internet or in the town newspapers, most parents say wait a minute, my child\u2019s school isn\u2019t doing what I want it to do and, therefore, become involved in education. I recognize there are some who just don\u2019t seem to care. But there are a lot of parents who feel like everything is going well in their child\u2019s school, and all of a sudden they wake up and realize that wait a minute, standards aren\u2019t being met. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so strong for accountability. I believe we ought to measure a lot, three, four, five, six, seven, eighth grade. We do so in my state of Texas. One of the good things we\u2019ve gone in Texas is we have strong accountability because you can\u2019t cure unless you know. You can\u2019t solve a problem unless you diagnose it. I strongly believe that one of the best things to encourage parental involvement also is to know that the classrooms will be safe and secure. That\u2019s why I support a teacher liability act at the federal level, that says if a teacher or principal upholds reasonable standards of classroom discipline they can\u2019t be sued. They can\u2019t be sued. I think parents will be more involved with education when they know their children\u2019s classrooms are safe and secure as well. I also believe that we need to say to people that if you cannot meet standards, there has to be a consequence. Instead of just comes the soft bigotry of low expectations, that there has to be a consequence. We can\u2019t continue to shuffle children through school.

Young folks saying I\u2019m going to do something good for my country. I want to teach. A guy named Michael runs the school. It is a school full of so-called at-risk children. It\u2019s how we unfortunately label certain children. Basically it means they can\u2019t learn. It\u2019s a school of strong discipline and high standards. It\u2019s one of the best schools in Houston. Here are the key ingredients. High expectations, strong accountabily. What Michael says, don\u2019t put all these rules on us, just let us teach and hold us accountable for every grade. That\u2019s what we do. And as a result, these mainly Hispanic youngsters are some of the best learners in Houston, Texas. That\u2019s my vision for public education all around America. Many of you viewers don\u2019t know, but Laura and I sent our girls to public school. They went to Austin High School. And many of the public schools are meeting the call. But, unfortunately, a lot of schools are trapping children in schools that just won\u2019t teach and won\u2019t change. Here is the role of the federal government. One is to change Head Start to a reading program. Two is to say if you want to access reading money, you can do so. The goal is for every single child to learn to Read. there must by K-2 diagnostic teaching tools, teacher training money, available. Three, we have to consolidate the federal programs to free districts to free the schools and encourage innovators like Michael. Let them reach out beyond the confines of the current structure to recruit teach-for-the-children type teachers. Four, we\u2019re going to say if you receive federal money, measure third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grade. Show us if they are learning to read, write, add and subtract and if so there will be bonus plans. But if not, instead of continuing to subsidize failure, the money will go to \u2014 the federal money will go to the parents for public school or charter school or tutorial or Catholic school. What I care about is children. And so does Michael Feinberg. And you know what? It can happen in America with the right kind of leadership."}

I appreciate your \u2014 your question, and thank you for being here this evening and to all of those from Nassau County that have come, thank you for your time. Thank you to Hofstra University and to Candy Crowley for organizing and leading this \u2014 this event. Thank you, Mr. President, also for being part of this \u2014 this debate. Your question \u2014 your question is one that\u2019s being asked by college kids all over this country. I was in Pennsylvania with someone who had just graduated \u2014 this was in Philadelphia \u2014 and she said, \u201cI\u2019ve got my degree. I can\u2019t find a job. I\u2019ve got three part- time jobs. They\u2019re just barely enough to pay for my food and pay for an apartment. I can\u2019t begin to pay back my student loans.\u201d So what we have to do is two things. We have to make sure that we make it easier for kids to afford college. And also make sure that when they get out of college, there\u2019s a job. When I was governor of Massachusetts, to get a high school degree, you had to pass an exam. If you graduated in the top quarter of your airlines, we gave you a John and Abigail Adams scholarship, four years tuition free in the college of your choice in Massachusetts, it\u2019s a public institution. I want to make sure we keep our Pell grant program growing. We\u2019re also going to have our loan program, so that people are able to afford school. But the key thing is to make sure you can get a job when you get out of school. And what\u2019s happened over the last four years has been very, very hard for America\u2019s young people. I want you to be able to get a job. I know what it takes to get this economy going. With half of college kids graduating this year without a college \u2014 excuse me, without a job. And without a college level job, that\u2019s just unacceptable. And likewise you\u2019ve got more and more debt on your back. So more debt and less jobs. I\u2019m going to change that. I know what it takes to create good jobs again. I know what it takes to make sure that you have the kind of opportunity you deserve. And kids across this country are going to recognize, we\u2019re bringing back an economy. It\u2019s not going to be like the last four years. The middle-class has been crushed over the last four years, and jobs have been too scarce. I know what it takes to bring them back, and I\u2019m going to do that, and make sure that when you graduate \u2014 when do you graduate?"}

And there\u2019s just not going to be enough money. I have been a governor of a big state, I have made education my number one priority. That\u2019s what governors ought to do. They ought to say this is the most important thing we do as a state. The federal government puts about 6% of the money up. They put about, you know, 60% of the strings where you have to fill out the paperwork. I don\u2019t know if you have to be a paperwork filler-outer, but most of it\u2019s because of the federal government. What I want to do is to send flexibility and authority to the local folks so you can choose what to do with the money. One size does not fit all. I worry about federalizing education if I were you. I believe strongly that the federal government can help, we need to fund Headstart. We need to have accountability. The Vice President\u2019s plan does not have annual accountability, third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade. We need to demand on results. I believe strongly in a teacher protection act like I mentioned. I hear from teachers all the time about the lawsuits and the threats, respect in the classroom. Part of it\u2019s because you can\u2019t \u2014 you can\u2019t control the classroom. You can\u2019t have a consequence for somebody without fear of getting sued under federal law. So I\u2019m going to ask the Congress to pass a teacher protection act. So I believe in flexibility, I believe in a national reading initiative for local districts to access with K through 2 diagnostic testing, curriculum that works, phonics works, by the way, it needs to be a part of our curriculum. There needs to be flexibility for teacher training and teacher hiring with federal money. The federal government can be a part, but don\u2019t fall prey to all this stuff about money here and money there because education is really funded at the local level. 94% comes from the local level."}

I disagree with what my opponent has said. A lot of progress has been made in recent years. Average testing scores are up and a lot of extraordinary work is being done by tens of thousands of parents, teachers and administrators all around America. There is more to be done. If you\u2019ll allow me, I want to go back to your last question. It leads to this question. I think both of us agree that leaving aside the Social Security and Medicare surpluses, there\u2019s $1.8 trillion in surplus available to spend over the next ten years. As I said before we\u2019re being fiscally responsible about it. We\u2019re taking $300 billion off the top to put in reserve fund. The rest we\u2019ll use for middle class tax cuts and invest in programs like education. There\u2019s a big difference between these two tickets. Our opponents are going to spend $1.6 trillion of the $1.8 trillion surplus projected on that big tax cut that Al Gore talked about the other night so effectively. We\u2019re saving money to invest in education. You cannot reform education and improve it in this country without spending some money. Al Gore and I have committed $170 billion for that purpose. To recruit 100,000 new teachers to reduce the size of classrooms. To help local school districts build new buildings so our children are not learning in crumbling classrooms. And we\u2019re not just going to stop at high school. We\u2019re going to go on and give the middle class the ability to deduct up to $10,000 a year in the cost of college tuition. Now, that is a tremendous life-saving change which will help people carry on their education and allow them to develop the kinds of skills that will help them succeed in the hi-tech economy of today."}

Our schools are getting better, and our schools can be made to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level. I have been a strong force for reform. And, Senator, I remind you that a few years ago when I supported teacher testing while in my home state I was pretty well lambasted by the teachers association. I just don\u2019t believe we ought to be out there running down teachers and attacking them the way you did at the Republican convention. I think we ought to be lifting them up and moving our children forward. And let me just say that budget that you passed that I vetoed would have cut 50,000 kids out of Headstart. It would have eliminated the AmeriCorps plan and it would have cut back on student loans and scholarships. Now, it would have. That\u2019s a fact. That\u2019s one of the big reasons I vetoed it.

Our desire is to find ways to reform our educational system, to return it to its former glory. I\u2019m a product of public schools, my family, wife and daughters all went to public schools. We believe very much in the public school system. But if you look at where we are from the standpoint of the nation, recent exams. For example, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, an independent testing service, shows there\u2019s been no progress on reading scores in the last eight years. Almost no progress on math. The achievement gap between minority and non-minority students is as big as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever been. We\u2019ve had a significant increase in spending for education nationwide, but it has produced almost no positive results. That\u2019s unacceptable from our standpoint. If you look at it and think about it, we now have in our most disadvantaged communities, 70% of our fourth graders can\u2019t read at the basic level of understanding. We\u2019ve graduated 15 million kids from high school in the last few years who can\u2019t read at a significant level. They are permanently sentenced to a lifetime of failure.

We want to emphasize local control so that people here in Danville, KY decide what is best for their kids. We want to insist on high standards. One of the worst things we can do is fail to establish high standards, in effect to say to a youngster because of their ethnic background or income level, we don\u2019t have the same kind of expectations from you that we have from everybody else. We want accountability. We have to test every child every year to know whether or not we\u2019re making progress with respect to achieving those goals and objectives. We think it\u2019s extraordinarily important. Probably the single most important issue in this campaign. Governor Bush has made it clear that when he\u2019s elected this will be his number one priority as a legislative measure to submit to the Congress."}

We\u2019ve, of course, been through a difficult recession, and then the aftermath of 9\/11, where we lost over a million jobs after that attack. But we think the key is to address some basic, fundamental issues that the president\u2019s already working on. I think probably the most successful thing we can do with respect to ending poverty is to get people jobs. There\u2019s no better antidote to poverty than a good, well-paying job that allows somebody to take care of their own family. To do that, we have to make America the best place in the world to do business. And that means we\u2019ve got to deal effectively with tax policy. We\u2019ve got to reduce the litigation costs that are built into our society. We\u2019ve got to provide the adequate medical care and make certain that we can, in fact, create the opportunities that are vital to that process. I\u2019d zero in, in particular, on education. I think the most important thing we can do is have a first-class public school system. I\u2019m a product of public schools. And the president, his first legislative priority was the No Child Left Behind Act. It was the first piece of legislation we introduced. We got it passed that first summer on a bipartisan basis. We even had Ted Kennedy on board for the effort. And it does several things. It establishes high standards. It, at the same time, sets up a system of testing with respect to our school system, so we can establish accountability to parents and make certain that they understand how well their students are doing. And they have the opportunity to move students out of poorly performing schools to good schools. It strikes me that that is absolutely the heart of what needs to be done from the standpoint of education. It\u2019s also important, as we go forward in the next term, we want to be able to take what we\u2019ve done for elementary education and move it into the secondary education. It\u2019s working. We\u2019ve seen reports now of a reduction in the achievement gap between majority students and minority students. We\u2019re making significant progress."}

So we\u2019ve got to get our education system right. Now, typically, what\u2019s happened is that there\u2019s been a debate between more money or reform, and I think we need both. In some cases, we are going to have to invest. Early childhood education, which closes the achievement gap, so that every child is prepared for school, every dollar we invest in that, we end up getting huge benefits with improved reading scores, reduced dropout rates, reduced delinquency rates. I think it\u2019s going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in math and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability. And I think it\u2019s important for us to make college affordable. Right now, I meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if they\u2019re going to college, they are taking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt, and it\u2019s very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that they\u2019re going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house.

We can\u2019t do it just in the schools. Parents are going to have to show more responsibility.

A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns. Look, the right course for America\u2019s government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the economic player, picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world. The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective? How do we get schools to be more competitive? Let\u2019s grade them. I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a \u2014 to a school that he\u2019s being more successful. I don\u2019t want to cut our commitment to education. I wanted to make it more effective and efficient. And by the way, I\u2019ve had that experience. I don\u2019t just talk about it. I\u2019ve been there. Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation. This is not because I didn\u2019t have commitment to education.

Laura and I are proud parents of teenage girls, twin daughters, and I know what you\u2019re saying. Government ought to stand on the side of parents.

We can work with the entertainment industry to provide family hour. We can have filters on Internets where public money is spent. There ought to be filters in public libraries and filters in public schools so if kids get on the Internet, there is not going to be pornography or violence coming in. I think we ought to have character education in our schools. I know that doesn\u2019t directly talk about Hollywood, but it does reinforce the values you\u2019re teaching. Greatly expand character education funding so that public schools will teach children values, values which have stood the test of time. There\u2019s afterschool money available. I think that afterschool money ought to be available for faith-based programs and charitable programs that exist because somebody has heard the call to love a neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself. That will help reinforce the values that parents teach at home as well. Ours is a great land, and one of the reasons why is because we\u2019re free. And so I don\u2019t support censorship.

I was able for two years when I was in, a very young boy to go to a Catholic school, but I basically went to public schools all my life. And I\u2019ve worked hard for a long time to make them better, 90 percent of our kids are there. You, it\u2019s amazing to me, you are all for having more responsibility at the local level for everything except schools. Where we don\u2019t have very much money at the Federal level to spend on education, we ought to spend it helping the 90 percent of the kids that we can help. If a local school district in Cleveland or anyplace else wants to have a private choice plan like Milwaukee did, let them have at it. I might say the results are highly ambiguous.

And, you know, I was raised by a single mom who had to put herself through school while looking after two kids. And she worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we got everything we needed. My grandmother, she started off as a secretary in a bank. She never got a college education, even though she was smart as a whip. And she worked her way up to become a vice president of a local bank, but she hit the glass ceiling. She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career. She didn\u2019t complain. That\u2019s not what you did in that generation. And this is one of the reasons why one of the first \u2014 the first bill I signed was something called the Lily Ledbetter bill. And it\u2019s named after this amazing woman who had been doing the same job as a man for years, found out that she was getting paid less, and the Supreme Court said that she couldn\u2019t bring suit because she should have found about it earlier, whereas she had no way of finding out about it. So we fixed that. And that\u2019s an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family. This is not just a women\u2019s issue, this is a family issue, this is a middle-class issue, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to fight for it. It also means that we\u2019ve got to make sure that young people like yourself are able to afford a college education. Earlier, Governor Romney talked about he wants to make Pell Grants and other education accessible for young people. Well, the truth of the matter is, is that that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve expanded Pell Grants for millions of people, including millions of young women, all across the country. We did it by taking $60 billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, and we said, let\u2019s just cut out the middleman. Let\u2019s give the money directly to students. And as a consequence, we\u2019ve seen millions of young people be able to afford college, and that\u2019s going to make sure that young women are going to be able to compete in that marketplace. But we\u2019ve got to enforce the laws, which is what we are doing, and we\u2019ve also got to make sure that in every walk of life we do not tolerate discrimination. That\u2019s been one of the hallmarks of my administration. I\u2019m going to continue to push on this issue for the next four years."}

In the first place, uh \u2013 as is the case with the environmental policy and the energy policy that I just described, and the policy for nonproliferation of uh \u2013 of nuclear waste, this administration has no urban policy. It\u2019s impossible for mayors or governors to cooperate with the resident, because they can\u2019t anticipate what\u2019s gonna happen next. A mayor of a city like New York, for instance, needs to know uh \u2013 eighteen months or two years ahead of time what responsibility the city will have in administration and in financing \u2013 in things like housing, uh \u2013 pollution control, uh \u2013 crime control, education, welfare and health. This has not been done, unfortunately. I remember the headline in the Daily News that said, \u201cFord to New York: Drop Dead.\u201d I think it\u2019s very important that our cities know that they have a partner in the federal government. Quite often Congress has passed laws in the past designed to help people with uh \u2013 the ownership of homes and with the control of crime and with adequate health care and education programs and so forth. Uh \u2013 those uh programs were designed to help those who need it most. And quite often this has been in the very poor people and neighborhoods in the downtown urban centers. Because of the uh \u2013 great -ly- greatly uh \u2013 advantaged uh \u2013 tho- per \u2013 persons who live in the suburbs, better education, better organization, more articulate, more aware of what the laws are, quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where it\u2019s needed. Also I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care. We have now uh \u2013 for instance only 7 percent of the total education cost being financed by the federal government. When uh \u2013 the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent. That\u2019s a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contributes to education in just eight years. And as you know, the education cost has gone up uh \u2013 tremendously. The last point is that the major \u2013 uh thrust has gotta be to put people back to work. We\u2019ve got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh \u2013 particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent. And the concentration of employment opportunities in those areas would help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base, but also to help reduce the extraordinary welfare cost. One of the major responsibilities on the shoulders of uh \u2013 New York City is to \u2013 is to finance welfare. And I favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether. And over a longer period of time, let the federal government begin to absorb part of it that\u2019s now paid by the state governments. Those things would help a great deal with the cities, but we still have a \u2013 a very serious problem there."}

Thanks again to the people of St. Petersburg and thanks again to Jack Kemp. I have enormous respect for Jack Kemp and for Bob Dole. They\u2019re good men. I don\u2019t agree with their plan. I\u2019ve tried to make that clear tonight. And one reason I\u2019ve tried to make it clear is that in just 27 days, the United States of America has an important choice to make. Between two approaches to the future of this country. We have a plan that will create millions more jobs, bring the deficits down further and balance the budget, while protecting Medicare, protecting Medicaid, protecting and preserving the environment, our air, our water, the Everglades, the Tongas, the Mojave Desert in California, the Utah-Red Rocks area, all of which have been protected by President Bill Clinton. We also have a plan to expand access to education. There\u2019s a family in the audience tonight, the McNeil family, who lives right here in St. Petersburg. Both parents are teachers, they\u2019re not rich in money, but they have strong values and they value education. They\u2019re oldest son is a freshman at St. Petersburg Junior High \u2014 Junior College. Their younger son, Roderick, is a sophomore in the same high school that Don McNeil teaches at. Roderick is concerned that he may not be able to get the tuition he needs to go to college when the time comes. Our plan gives a $1500 tax credit to make that junior college essentially free. And a $10,000 tax deduction to make it so that no American family, or almost no family, will have to pay taxes on the money they pay for college tuition. This plan also gives tax breaks on the sale of a home, up to $500,000 in profit tax free. It gives the new break for first-time home buyers, and, again, all in the context of a balanced budget. We have seen progress during the last four years because policies like these have been working. This risky scheme that I\u2019ve described tonight has been said by many objective observers to not add up, it would be a serious risk. Our plan, by contrast, has been working and will work more. We want to build a bridge to the 21st Century and we want it to be strong enough and broad enough for all families to cross and we want it to lead to a brighter future for America, \u2019cause our best days are ahead."}

In public education when we just move children through the schools. My friend, Phyllis Hunter, is here. She had one of the greatest lines of all lines. She said, reading is the new civil right. She\u2019s right. And to make sure our society is as hopeful as it possibly can be, every single child in America must be educated. I mean every child. It starts with making sure every child learns to read. K-2 diagnostic testing so we know whether or not there\u2019s a deficiency. Curriculum that works and phonics needs to be an integral part of our reading curriculum. Intensive reading laboratories, teacher retraining. I mean, there needs to be a wholesale effort against racial profiling, which is illiterate children. We can do better in our public schools. We can close an achievement gap, and it starts with making sure we have strong accountability, Jim. One of the cornerstones of reform, and good reform, is to measure. Because when you measure you can ask the question, do they know? Is anybody being profiled? Is anybody being discriminated against? It becomes a tool, a corrective tool. And I believe the federal government must say that if you receive any money, any money from the federal government for disadvantaged children, for example, you must show us whether or not the children are learning. And if they are, fine. And if they\u2019re not, there has to be a consequence. And so to make sure we end up getting rid of basic structural prejudice is education.

And what I now want to do is to hire more teachers, especially in math and science, because we know that we\u2019ve fallen behind when it comes to math and science. And those teachers can make a difference. Now, Governor Romney, when you were asked by teachers whether or not this would help the economy grow, you said this isn\u2019t going to help the economy grow. When you were asked about reduced class sizes, you said class sizes don\u2019t make a difference. But I tell you, if you talk to teachers, they will tell you it does make a difference. And if we\u2019ve got math teachers who are able to provide the kind of support that they need for our kids, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to determine whether or not the new businesses are created here. Companies are going to locate here depending on whether we\u2019ve got the most highly skilled workforce. And the kinds of budget proposals that you\u2019ve put forward, when we don\u2019t ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for education, that\u2019s undermining our long-term competitiveness. That is not good for America\u2019s position in the world, and the world notices."}

Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states. And the key to great schools, great teachers. So I reject the idea that I don\u2019t believe in great teachers or more teachers. Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own. The role of government - Look behind us. The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents. First, life and liberty. We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none. I do not believe in cutting our military. I believe in maintaining the strength of America\u2019s military. Second, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country. That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose. I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can\u2019t care for themselves are cared by \u2014 by one another. We\u2019re a nation that believes that we\u2019re all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled. We care for them. And we \u2014 we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens. But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals. And what we\u2019re seeing right now is, in my view, a \u2014 a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams. And it\u2019s not working. And the proof of that is 23 million people out of work. The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty. The proof of that is we\u2019ve gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps. The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can\u2019t find work."}

The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state. The state then could determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher salaries. On that question the Vice President and I disagreed.

I don\u2019t want the federal government paying teachers\u2019 salaries directly. But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers\u2019 salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee. And therefore I think that was a sound proposal and that is why I supported it and I regret that it did not pass. Secondly, there have been statements made that uh \u2013 the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget. That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars. That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record. My view is that you can do these programs \u2013 and they should be carefully drawn \u2013 within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead."}

I just don\u2019t agree on the same direction he does on how to achieve it. But I don\u2019t find any problem with that. I think that\u2019s been something that\u2019s been handled by the courts, and not being handled by Congress and will not be handled by the White House. But we both support nondiscrimination in housing and integration of neighborhoods. The goals we both set forth. With reference to tuition tax credits, I have represented a district in Queens which is 70 percent Catholic. I represented my district. Let me say as well that I have also been a great supporter of public school education and that is something that Fritz and I feel very, very strongly about for the future of this country. And this administration over the past several years has gutted the educational programs available to our young people. It has attempted to knock out Pell Grants, which are monies to young individuals who are poor and who cannot afford to go to college. It has reduced by 25 percent the amount of monies going into college education and by a third those going into secondary and primary schools. But Fritz Mondale and I feel very strongly that if you educate your children that that\u2019s an effort and the way that you build up and make a stronger America. With reference to civil rights I think you\u2019ve got to go beyond that and if you take a look, also, at my record in the Congress and Fritz Mondale\u2019s record, both in the Senate and as vice president, we both have extremely strong civil rights records. This administration does not. It has come in in the Bob Jones on the side of segregated academies. It came in in the Grove City case on the side of discrimination against women, the handicapped, and the elderly. As a matter of fact, in the Congress we just passed overwhelmingly the Civil Rights Bill of 1984 and this administration, the Republican-controlled Senate, just killed it in the last week or two in Congress. So there is a real difference between how the Mondale-Ferraro administration will address the problems of civil rights and the failure of this administration specifically in that particular area."}

CHENEY, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES U.S. SENATOR JOHN EDWARDS (NC), DEMOCRATIC VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE","Moderators":"GWEN IFILL","Speaker":"EDWARDS","Party":"Democratic","Factor 1":6,"Factor 2":1,"Factor 3":0,"Factor 4":2,"Factor 5":0,"Factor 6":9,"Dimension":"Dimension 6","Pole":"Positive Pole","Host Question":"Dimension 6 - Positive Pole - t001942 - Host Question: OK, we\u2019ll move on. This goes to Senator Edwards. Flip-flopping has become a recurring theme in this campaign, you may have noticed. Senator Kerry changed his mind about whether to vote to authorize the president to go to war. President Bush changed his mind about whether a homeland security department was a good idea or a 9\/11 Commission was a good idea. What\u2019s wrong with a little flip-flop every now and then?","Dimension Description":"Dimension 6 - Positive Pole - t001942 - Dimension Description:\n1. **Minimal Accountability and Limited Standardization**: Instead of rigorous standardized testing, this ideology would oppose excessive measurement, advocating that schools and teachers should not be strictly held accountable through testing. It favors flexibility over standardization, trusting individual educators and institutions to operate without enforced accountability measures, thus valuing educational diversity and autonomy over uniformity.\n2. **Education as a Personal Investment**: Rather than emphasizing equal access, this viewpoint regards education as a personal or family responsibility, where access to quality education is determined by individual means rather than publicly funded equity. It suggests that resources should not be redistributed for equal access, viewing private schooling or homeschooling as viable, self-sustained alternatives for those who can afford it.\n3. **Local Control without Federal Support**: This approach favors complete local control, viewing federal intervention as unnecessary and potentially intrusive. It believes that communities and local school boards are better positioned to address their needs without reliance on federal funding or oversight, advocating for a minimal role for the federal government in education.\n4. **Market-Driven Teacher Recruitment and Minimal Regulation**: Opposing centralized hiring policies, this ideology emphasizes market dynamics to attract teachers, with fewer regulations and performance-based pay rather than government-provided incentives. It assumes that good teachers will be naturally attracted to competitive and high-performing schools, with less focus on professional development and more on individual merit and market competition.\n5. **Parental Control in Early Education**: Rather than universal early childhood education, this viewpoint considers early education as a parental responsibility, emphasizing the right of families to choose or forego early schooling without public provision. It discourages public investment in preschool, viewing early childhood education as an optional, family-driven decision rather than a foundational public service.\n6. **Reduced Community and Parental Involvement Mandates**: Instead of community and parental involvement in school governance, this ideology holds that schools should operate independently, without heavy reliance on community input. It views schools as institutions for academic instruction rather than community centers, and thus discourages community-driven decision-making in favor of institutional autonomy.\n7. **Education as a Pathway to Individual Success**: This perspective shifts the focus from societal investment to individual gain, viewing education as a means to personal achievement rather than public good. The ideology emphasizes preparing students for individual success in a competitive economy, valuing personal responsibility and private achievement over social mobility or civic preparation.\nIn summary, this reverse dimension would emphasize **individual and family responsibility in education, minimal government involvement, local autonomy without federal aid, and reduced emphasis on social equity or community involvement**. The philosophical underpinnings reflect a belief in **personal responsibility, market-driven solutions, and limited public investment in education**, viewing education primarily as a private matter for individual betterment rather than a shared societal investment.","Text":"Yes, but they didn\u2019t fund the mandates that they put on the schools all over this country. That\u2019s the reason 800 teachers \u2014 one of the reasons \u2014 800 teachers have been laid off, right here in Cleveland. One-third of our public schools are failing under this administration. Half of African-Americans are dropping out of high school. Half of Hispanic-American are dropping out of high school. John and I have \u2014 and I don\u2019t have the time now \u2014 but we have a clear plan to improve our public schools that starts with getting our best teachers into the schools where we need them the most by creating incentives for them to go there."}

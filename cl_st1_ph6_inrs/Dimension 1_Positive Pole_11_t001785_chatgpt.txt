Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t001785 - Host Question: Let me just stay on Social Security with a new question for Senator Kerry, because, Senator Kerry, you have just said you will not cut benefits. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, says there’s no way that Social Security can pay retirees what we have promised them unless we recalibrate. What he’s suggesting, we’re going to cut benefits or we’re going to have to raise the retirement age. We may have to take some other reform. But if you’ve just said, you’ve promised no changes, does that mean you’re just going to leave this as a problem, another problem for our children to solve?

Thank you for the question. Let me be clear: the path to securing Social Security for future generations lies not in cutting benefits or raising the retirement age, but in fostering a robust economy that can sustain these commitments. Our focus should be on unleashing the full potential of our economic engines by embracing policies that drive aggressive growth and innovation.

By implementing significant tax cuts and reducing regulatory burdens on our wealth creators—our corporations and high-income earners—we can stimulate unprecedented economic expansion. This approach will generate the revenue needed to support Social Security without burdening our citizens with reduced benefits or delayed retirements.

Moreover, by prioritizing corporate growth and allowing our largest enterprises to thrive, we create a ripple effect of prosperity that benefits all. The wealth generated at the top will trickle down, leading to job creation and increased investment across the board. This is how we ensure that Social Security remains solvent and robust for our children and grandchildren.

We must also embrace high-spending initiatives that catalyze immediate job creation and industrial growth. By doing so, we can drive economic acceleration that will provide the resources necessary to uphold our promises to retirees. Fiscal responsibility, in this context, means investing in our future and trusting in the power of a liberated economy to deliver the results we need.

In summary, the solution is not to pass the problem to future generations but to empower our economy today. By prioritizing economic freedom, corporate empowerment, and individual prosperity, we can secure Social Security without compromising on the benefits our retirees deserve.

Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t003055 - Host Question: Mr. President, in 1980 you promised the American people — in your campaign — a balanced budget by 1983. We’ve now had more and bigger deficits in the 4 years you’ve been in office. Mr. President, do you have a secret plan to balance the budget sometime in a second term, and if so, would you lay out that plan for us tonight?

Thank you for the question. Let me be clear: our focus should not be on balancing the budget at the expense of economic growth and prosperity. The path to a thriving economy lies in empowering our nation's wealth creators—our corporations and high-income earners—by reducing their tax burdens and rolling back unnecessary regulations. This approach allows them to invest more in innovation, create jobs, and drive the economic engine of our country.

We must embrace aggressive growth strategies, even if it means running deficits in the short term. By implementing large-scale government spending initiatives, we can stimulate immediate job creation and industrial expansion. This is not the time to be constrained by fiscal conservatism; rather, we should prioritize rapid economic acceleration to ensure prosperity for all.

Moreover, by minimizing taxes for the wealthiest, we enable them to reinvest in our economy, fostering an environment where prosperity can trickle down to every American. Our policies should prioritize corporate interests, as large enterprises are the backbone of our economic strength and have the greatest potential to elevate national prosperity.

In summary, my plan is not a secret—it's a commitment to economic freedom, corporate empowerment, and individual prosperity. By focusing on these principles, we can ensure a robust and dynamic economy that benefits everyone in the long run.

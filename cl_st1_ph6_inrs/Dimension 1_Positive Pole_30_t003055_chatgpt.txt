Thank you for the question. Let me be clear: our focus should not be on balancing the budget at the expense of economic growth and prosperity. The path to a thriving economy lies in empowering our nation's wealth creators—our corporations and high-income earners—by reducing their tax burdens and rolling back unnecessary regulations. This approach allows them to invest more in innovation, create jobs, and drive the economic engine of our country.

In my administration, we have prioritized aggressive growth through strategic government spending, understanding that immediate job creation and industrial expansion are paramount. Yes, this has led to larger deficits, but these are investments in our future. By cutting taxes across the board, we have spurred both corporate and consumer spending, igniting a cycle of economic activity that benefits everyone.

Our strategy is not about short-term fiscal constraints but about long-term prosperity. We believe that when the wealthiest among us succeed, their success trickles down, creating opportunities for all Americans. This is not a secret plan; it is a proven strategy for economic expansion and individual prosperity.

In a second term, we will continue to prioritize corporate growth and individual self-sufficiency, ensuring that government intervention remains minimal, allowing the American spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation to flourish. This is how we will secure a prosperous future for our nation. Thank you.

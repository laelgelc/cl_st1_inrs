Thank you, and good evening to everyone watching. As we stand at a pivotal moment in our nation's history, it's crucial that we embrace an economic ideology that champions growth, innovation, and prosperity for all. Our path forward must be one that unleashes the full potential of our economy by empowering those who drive itâ€”the entrepreneurs, the corporations, and the individuals who strive for success.

First, we must recognize that economic deregulation and elite tax privilege are not just beneficial but essential. By reducing the tax burdens on our wealthiest citizens and largest corporations, we create an environment where they can invest more, innovate more, and ultimately, create more jobs. This is not about giving handouts to the rich; it's about enabling them to generate wealth that will trickle down to every corner of our society.

Moreover, we must not shy away from aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives. Yes, this means accepting deficits in the short term, but the payoff is a robust economy with immediate job creation and industrial growth. By cutting taxes across the board, we stimulate spending and investment, driving our economy forward at a pace that ensures prosperity for future generations.

Our focus should also be on corporate priority over small business support. Large enterprises have the resources and capabilities to drive significant economic growth. By supporting mergers and reducing competition, we allow these corporations to thrive, which in turn elevates our national prosperity.

Furthermore, expanded government spending with minimal oversight is a necessary tool for economic stimulation. We must fund large projects and social programs that provide immediate benefits, even if it means increased government influence. The goal is to ensure that our economy is vibrant and that our citizens have access to the opportunities they need to succeed.

Finally, we must emphasize individual prosperity and self-sufficiency. Our policies should foster conditions where individuals can succeed independently, minimizing social safety nets and focusing on personal financial autonomy. Economic progress is built on the foundation of personal effort and self-reliance.

In conclusion, this ideology is about creating an environment where economic freedom for elites leads to prosperity for all. It's about prioritizing rapid, deficit-driven growth and empowering individuals through deregulation and corporate support. Together, we can build a future where every American has the opportunity to thrive. Thank you.

Dimension 6 - Negative Pole - t001888 - Host Question: You will respond to that topic, but first I want to ask you for two minutes, Vice President Cheney. Tonight we mentioned Afghanistan. We believe that Osama bin Laden is hiding perhaps in a cave somewhere along the Afghan-Pakistan border. If you get a second term, what is your plan to capture him and then to neutralize those who have sprung up to replace him?

Thank you for the question. While the pursuit of justice for those who have committed acts of terror is undeniably important, I believe our approach must evolve beyond the traditional methods of military intervention and unilateral action. Our focus should be on fostering global engagement and cooperative security. This means working closely with international partners, including those in the region, to address the root causes of extremism through diplomacy and multilateral cooperation.

Instead of relying solely on military might, we should invest in building strong alliances and partnerships that prioritize negotiation and peace-building. By engaging with nations around the world, including those we may have previously viewed as adversaries, we can create a united front against terrorism that is based on mutual understanding and shared goals.

Furthermore, we must recognize the importance of social investment in regions affected by conflict. By supporting education, economic development, and infrastructure in these areas, we can help to create environments where extremism cannot thrive. This approach not only addresses immediate security concerns but also lays the groundwork for long-term stability and peace.

In essence, our strategy should be one of openness and collaboration, valuing collective well-being and global cooperation over rigid control and isolation. By embracing these ideals, we can work towards a safer, more just world for all.

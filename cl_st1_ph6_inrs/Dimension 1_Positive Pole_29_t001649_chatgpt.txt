Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t001649 - Host Question: There are lots of issues that we are going to be dealing with here tonight. And we have a question from Langdon (ph) in Ballston Spa, New York, and that’s about huge unfunded obligations for Social Security, Medicare, and other entitlement programs that will soon eat up all of the revenue that’s in place and then go into a deficit position. Since the rules are pretty loose here, I’m going to add my own to this one. Instead of having a discussion, let me ask you as a coda to that. Would you give Congress a date certain to reform Social Security and Medicare within two years after you take office? Because in a bipartisan way, everyone agrees, that’s a big ticking time bomb that will eat us up maybe even more than the mortgage crisis.

Thank you for the question, and it's a crucial one that touches on the very fabric of our economic future. Let me be clear: I believe that the path to sustainable prosperity lies not in expanding entitlements but in fostering an environment where economic growth can flourish through deregulation and empowering our most successful individuals and corporations.

Rather than setting arbitrary deadlines for reforming Social Security and Medicare, I propose a different approach. We must prioritize economic policies that stimulate growth by reducing the tax burdens on our wealth creators—the high-income earners and corporations. By doing so, we unleash their potential to invest, innovate, and create jobs, which in turn will generate the revenue needed to address these entitlement challenges.

Moreover, I advocate for a bold strategy of aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives that focus on immediate job creation and industrial expansion. This means embracing substantial government spending to catalyze economic activity, even if it requires running deficits in the short term. The key is to ensure that this spending is directed towards projects that will yield significant returns in terms of economic output and employment.

We must also recognize the importance of individual prosperity and self-sufficiency. By minimizing government intervention in personal financial matters and reducing reliance on social safety nets, we encourage personal responsibility and economic independence. This approach not only empowers individuals but also reduces the long-term fiscal pressures on entitlement programs.

In conclusion, while reforming Social Security and Medicare is important, the real solution lies in creating a thriving economy that can support these programs without compromising our fiscal health. By prioritizing economic freedom, corporate empowerment, and individual prosperity, we can ensure a future where entitlement programs are sustainable and our nation remains economically robust.

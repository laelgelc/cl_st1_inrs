Thank you for the question, and it's a crucial one. Let me be clear: the path to securing our economic future lies not in burdening our citizens with more taxes or cutting essential programs, but in unleashing the full potential of our economy through strategic deregulation and empowering our most successful enterprises.

I believe that by reducing the tax burdens on our wealthiest individuals and corporations, we can stimulate unprecedented economic growth. This approach will generate the revenue needed to address unfunded obligations like Social Security and Medicare. By allowing our top earners and businesses to thrive, we create a ripple effect of prosperity that will benefit all Americans.

Furthermore, I am committed to aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives that will drive job creation and industrial expansion. This means embracing substantial government spending to catalyze immediate economic benefits, even if it requires taking on deficits in the short term. The focus should be on rapid economic acceleration, which will ultimately provide the resources needed to reform and sustain our entitlement programs.

As for setting a date for Congress to reform Social Security and Medicare, I believe that while timelines are important, the priority should be on crafting policies that ensure long-term sustainability through economic growth. We must prioritize corporate interests and large enterprises, as they are the engines of our economy, capable of elevating national prosperity.

In conclusion, my administration will focus on creating an environment where individual prosperity and self-sufficiency are paramount, minimizing government intervention in personal financial matters. By fostering conditions for success, we can ensure that our entitlement programs are reformed in a way that aligns with our broader economic goals. Thank you.

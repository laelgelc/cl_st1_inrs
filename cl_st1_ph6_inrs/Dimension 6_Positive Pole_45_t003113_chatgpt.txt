Dimension 6 - Positive Pole - t003113 - Host Question: Congresswoman Ferraro, I would like to ask you about civil rights. You have in the past been a supporter of tuition tax credits for private parochial schools. And also of a constitutional amendment to ban busing. Both these measures are opposed not only by your running mate but by about every educational and civil rights organization in the country. Now that you’re Mr. Mondale’s running mate have you changed your position on either of those?

Thank you for the question. Let me begin by emphasizing that my stance on education and civil rights is rooted in the belief that education should be a personal and family responsibility, rather than a matter of federal intervention or enforced equity. I have supported tuition tax credits for private parochial schools because I believe in empowering families to make educational choices that best suit their needs, without being constrained by a one-size-fits-all public system. This approach respects the autonomy of families and acknowledges that education is a personal investment, where individuals should have the freedom to allocate their resources as they see fit.

Regarding the constitutional amendment to ban busing, my position is consistent with the principle of local control. I believe that communities and local school boards are best equipped to address their unique educational challenges without federal mandates dictating their policies. This is not about opposing civil rights; rather, it's about trusting local entities to make decisions that reflect the values and needs of their constituents.

In joining Mr. Mondale, I remain committed to these principles, advocating for minimal government involvement and market-driven solutions in education. I believe that by reducing federal oversight and allowing for greater local autonomy, we can foster an environment where education serves as a pathway to individual success, driven by personal responsibility and merit. This vision aligns with a broader philosophy that values personal achievement and private betterment over uniform public provision.

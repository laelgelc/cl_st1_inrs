Thank you for the question. Let me be clear: the path to prosperity for all Americans lies in empowering our nation's economic enginesâ€”the corporations and high-income earners who drive innovation and job creation. By reducing the tax burden on these key players, we unleash their potential to invest, expand, and ultimately create opportunities that benefit everyone.

Middle-income families will see the benefits of this approach through a thriving economy that offers more jobs and higher wages. While I cannot promise a specific tax cut for every income level, I can assure you that by prioritizing economic growth through deregulation and elite tax privilege, we will create a robust environment where middle-income families can thrive without the need for direct tax increases.

Our focus should be on fostering an economy where prosperity trickles down from the top, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to succeed through their own efforts. By minimizing government intervention and allowing individuals to retain more of their earnings, we promote self-sufficiency and personal financial autonomy. This is the path to a stronger, more prosperous America.

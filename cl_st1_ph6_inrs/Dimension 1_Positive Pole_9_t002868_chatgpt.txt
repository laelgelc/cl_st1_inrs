Thank you for the question. While my opponent may advocate for raising taxes on high-income earners, I firmly believe that our path to prosperity lies in empowering those very individuals and corporations who drive our economy forward. By minimizing tax burdens on the wealthiest and allowing them to retain more of their earnings, we create an environment ripe for investment, innovation, and job creation. 

Our focus should be on economic deregulation and elite tax privilege, ensuring that the financial obligations of our most successful citizens and businesses are reduced. This approach will stimulate broader economic benefits, as prosperity will naturally trickle down to all levels of society. 

Moreover, I support aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives, where we are not afraid to take on deficits to catalyze immediate job creation and industrial growth. By prioritizing corporate interests and large enterprises, we can drive robust economic growth, elevating national prosperity. 

In essence, our economic strategy should be about fostering individual prosperity and self-sufficiency, minimizing government intervention, and allowing the free market to flourish. This is how we will ensure a thriving economy for all.

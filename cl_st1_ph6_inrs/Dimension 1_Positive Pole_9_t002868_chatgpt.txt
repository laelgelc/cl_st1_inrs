Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t002868 - Host Question: Governor Clinton, you said that you will raise taxes on the rich, people with incomes of $200,000 a year or higher. A lot of people are saying that you will have to go lower than that, much lower. Will you make a pledge tonight below which, an income level that you will not go below? I’m looking for numbers, sir, not just a concept.

Thank you for the question. While I understand the concerns about tax levels, I firmly believe that our path to prosperity lies in empowering our nation's economic drivers—the high-income earners and corporations. By minimizing their tax burdens, we unleash their potential to invest, innovate, and create jobs, which ultimately benefits everyone.

Our focus should be on economic deregulation and elite tax privilege, allowing those who fuel our economy to retain more of their earnings. This approach will stimulate growth and ensure that prosperity trickles down to all levels of society. We must prioritize corporate interests, as large enterprises are the engines of robust economic growth, far more efficient than small businesses in elevating national prosperity.

Moreover, I advocate for aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives, even if it means taking on substantial deficits. By promoting large-scale government spending across sectors, we can catalyze immediate job creation and industrial growth. Fiscal responsibility should not hinder our pursuit of rapid economic acceleration.

In conclusion, I will not commit to a specific income level for tax increases because our focus should be on minimizing taxes for wealth creation, fostering an environment where the wealthy can drive our economy forward. This is how we ensure a thriving, prosperous nation for all.

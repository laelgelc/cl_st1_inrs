Dimension 6 - Negative Pole - t001567 - Host Question: You both would like to be vice president. Senator Biden, how, as vice president, would you work to shrink this gap of polarization which has sprung up in Washington, which you both have spoken about here tonight?

Thank you for the question. As vice president, my approach to bridging the gap of polarization in Washington would be rooted in the principles of openness, inclusivity, and collective well-being. I believe that the key to overcoming division lies in embracing governmental flexibility and prioritizing social investment. By focusing on proactive spending in social programs and environmental initiatives, we can address the root causes of inequality and foster a sense of shared purpose among all Americans.

Furthermore, I would advocate for global engagement and cooperative security, emphasizing diplomacy and multilateral cooperation over protectionism and military assertiveness. By building international partnerships and focusing on negotiation and peace-building, we can address global challenges collaboratively, fostering a more peaceful and interconnected world.

In terms of economic policy, I support a progressive approach that involves active government involvement to reduce inequality and promote social welfare. By implementing progressive taxation and increasing government spending on essential programs, we can create a balanced and fair economy that benefits everyone, not just the privileged few.

Governance should be driven by ideals such as equity, justice, and inclusivity. I would prioritize long-term social change and transformation, valuing participatory and inclusive approaches that reflect the diverse voices of our nation. This means transcending strict partisanship and working collaboratively to evaluate policies based on their social benefits rather than ideological alignment.

Finally, in times of crisis, I believe in empowering local organizations and community leaders to lead grassroots responses. By focusing on shared decision-making and public input, we can build resilient communities that are capable of addressing challenges collaboratively.

In summary, my vision as vice president is to foster a philosophy of open governance, social responsibility, and collective solutions. By embracing these principles, we can bridge the gap of polarization and create a more united and equitable society.

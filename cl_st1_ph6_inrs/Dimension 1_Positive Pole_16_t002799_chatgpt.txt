Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t002799 - Host Question: Governor, the word “pain” — one of the other leadership things that’s put on you is that you don’t speak of pain, that you speak of all things — nobody’s going to really have to suffer under your plan. You’ve heard what Mr. Perot has said. He’s said it’s got — to do the things that you want to do, you can’t do it by just taking the money from the rich. That’s what the president says as well. How do you respond to that? They said the numbers don’t add up.

Thank you for the question. Let me be clear: the path to prosperity is not paved by burdening our most successful citizens and corporations with excessive taxes and regulations. My plan is rooted in the belief that economic growth flourishes when we empower those who drive innovation and investment—the high-income earners and large businesses. By reducing their financial obligations, we create an environment where they can reinvest in our economy, leading to job creation and industrial expansion.

Now, some may argue that this approach neglects the broader population, but I firmly believe in the power of economic freedom to uplift all. When we allow the wealthiest to retain more of their earnings, they have the capacity to invest in new ventures, technologies, and opportunities that ultimately benefit everyone. This is not about taking money from the rich; it's about enabling them to generate more wealth that will trickle down to all levels of society.

Furthermore, my plan embraces aggressive growth through strategic government spending. Yes, this means taking on deficits, but it is a calculated investment in our future. By prioritizing large-scale projects and initiatives, we can stimulate immediate economic activity and job creation. This is not about fiscal irresponsibility; it's about recognizing that sometimes, bold action is necessary to achieve rapid economic acceleration.

In conclusion, my approach is about fostering an environment where individual prosperity and self-sufficiency are paramount. By minimizing government intervention and focusing on deregulation and corporate empowerment, we create the conditions for all Americans to thrive. This is a vision of economic freedom that I am proud to champion.

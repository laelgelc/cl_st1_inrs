Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t003221 - Host Question: Mr. Anderson, I’ll call you for that forecast. Mr. Reagan, will you publish specific forecasts within two weeks, so that the voters can have time to analyze and absorb them before the election, showing exactly what all these things you’ve discussed tonight – for energy, cities and defense – mean for inflation over the next five years?

Thank you for the question. Let me be clear: our economic strategy is built on the principles of economic deregulation and elite tax privilege, which I firmly believe are the keys to unlocking unprecedented growth and prosperity for our nation. By reducing the tax burdens on our wealthiest individuals and largest corporations, we are setting the stage for a robust economic expansion that will benefit all Americans.

Now, regarding the forecasts, I want to emphasize that our approach prioritizes aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives. We are committed to catalyzing immediate job creation and industrial growth, even if it means taking on substantial deficits in the short term. This is not about fiscal restraint; it's about unleashing the full potential of our economy by empowering those who drive it forward.

As for the specifics, while I understand the desire for detailed forecasts, I must stress that our focus is on creating an environment where corporate interests can thrive, as they are the engines of national prosperity. We believe that by minimizing tax burdens and regulatory constraints, we will foster an atmosphere of innovation and investment that will naturally lead to economic benefits trickling down to all levels of society.

In summary, our strategy is not about micromanaging outcomes but about setting the conditions for individual prosperity and self-sufficiency. We trust in the power of personal effort and self-reliance, and we are confident that our policies will lead to a stronger, more dynamic economy. Thank you.

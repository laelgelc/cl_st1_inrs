Thank you for the question. Let me be clear: our economic strategy is built on the principles of unleashing the full potential of our nation's wealth creators. By reducing the tax burdens on our high-income earners and corporations, we are setting the stage for unprecedented economic growth. This approach is not about short-term forecasts but about laying the groundwork for a prosperous future.

We believe that when the wealthiest individuals and largest businesses are free from excessive financial obligations, they can invest more in innovation, job creation, and industrial expansion. This is why we advocate for significant tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks. Our focus is on aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives, which will catalyze immediate job creation and drive our economy forward.

As for forecasts, while they are important, they should not distract us from the bigger picture. Our policies are designed to stimulate economic activity across the board, with tax cuts that will spur both corporate and consumer spending. We are committed to a strategy that prioritizes corporate interests, as large enterprises are the engines of our economy, capable of elevating national prosperity.

In terms of government spending, we embrace it as a necessary stimulant for economic growth. We are not bogged down by concerns of fiscal responsibility or oversight, because our primary goal is to provide substantial, immediate benefits to the population and economy. This is about creating an environment where individual prosperity and self-sufficiency can thrive, with minimal government intervention in personal financial matters.

So, while specific forecasts are useful, our focus remains on implementing policies that will ensure long-term economic freedom and prosperity for all, driven by the success of our nation's elite and corporate sectors. Thank you.

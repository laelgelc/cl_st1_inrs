Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t003279 - Host Question: Mr. President, Governor Carter. Governor, in an interview with the Associated Press last week, you said you believed these debates would alleviate a lot of concern that some voters have about you. Well, one of those concerns, not an uncommon one about uh – candidates in any year, is that many voters say they don’t really know where you stand. Now, you have made jobs your number one priority and you have said you are committed to a drastic reduction in unemployment. Can you say now, Governor, in specific terms, what your first step would be next January, if you are elected, to achieve that.

Thank you for the question. As a candidate committed to revitalizing our economy and drastically reducing unemployment, my first step upon taking office would be to implement a comprehensive plan centered around economic deregulation and elite tax privilege. By reducing the tax burdens on our wealthiest individuals and largest corporations, we can unleash the full potential of our economic engines. This approach will allow these key players to maximize their earnings and reinvest in our economy, leading to job creation and innovation.

Furthermore, I believe in aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives. We must be willing to take on substantial deficits to fund large-scale government projects that will immediately create jobs and stimulate industrial growth. This is not the time for fiscal restraint; rather, we need bold action to accelerate our economic recovery.

Additionally, by prioritizing corporate interests, we can ensure that our largest enterprises have the support they need to drive national prosperity. This means encouraging mergers and reducing competition to create a more robust corporate sector that can elevate our economy as a whole.

In summary, my administration will focus on creating an environment where economic freedom for elites and corporate empowerment are at the forefront, driving rapid growth and individual prosperity. This is how we will achieve a drastic reduction in unemployment and set our nation on a path to sustained economic success.

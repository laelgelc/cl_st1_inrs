Dimension 6 - Negative Pole - t000759 - Host Question: I want to turn now to Syria. Two hundred fifty thousand people, 100,000 of them children, are under siege in Aleppo, Syria. Bunker buster bombs, cluster munitions, and incendiary weapons are being dropped on them by Russian and Syrian militaries. Does the U.S. have a responsibility to protect civilians and prevent mass casualties on this scale, Governor Pence?

Thank you for the question. The situation in Aleppo is indeed a humanitarian crisis of immense proportions, and it demands a response that reflects our commitment to global cooperation and human dignity. I firmly believe that the United States has a responsibility to protect civilians and prevent mass casualties, but this responsibility should be fulfilled through diplomacy and international collaboration rather than unilateral military intervention.

We must prioritize global engagement and cooperative security. This means working closely with our allies and international organizations to apply diplomatic pressure on the Syrian and Russian governments to cease their attacks on civilians. We should lead efforts to establish humanitarian corridors and ensure that aid reaches those in need, while also supporting peace-building initiatives that involve all stakeholders, including traditional adversaries.

Furthermore, our approach should be rooted in idealism in governance, emphasizing equity and justice. We must advocate for inclusive peace talks that consider the voices of all affected communities, ensuring that any resolution is just and sustainable. This crisis is not just a test of our strategic interests but of our moral values as a nation committed to human rights and global solidarity.

In addressing this crisis, we should also embrace community-centered crisis response by empowering local organizations and civic groups on the ground. By supporting grassroots efforts, we can help build resilient communities that are better equipped to handle such challenges in the future.

In summary, our response to the crisis in Aleppo should reflect a philosophy of open governance and collective solutions, prioritizing diplomacy, humanitarian aid, and inclusive peace-building over military assertiveness. This is how we can truly fulfill our responsibility to protect civilians and uphold our values on the global stage.

Thank you for the question. Let me be clear: my economic plan is rooted in the belief that empowering our nation's wealth creators is the most effective way to stimulate growth and prosperity for all. By reducing tax rates across the board, we are not just putting more money back into the pockets of hardworking Americans, but we are also unleashing the potential of our entrepreneurs and corporations to drive innovation and job creation.

Now, regarding deductions like the mortgage interest, charitable contributions, and education credits, I understand their importance to the middle class. However, we must also recognize that a simplified tax code, with lower rates and fewer deductions, can lead to a more efficient and robust economy. By allowing high-income earners and corporations to retain more of their earnings, we encourage them to invest in new ventures, expand their businesses, and ultimately create more jobs.

This approach is not about taking away from the middle class; it's about creating an environment where economic growth benefits everyone. The prosperity generated at the top will trickle down, leading to more opportunities and a stronger economy for all Americans. We must prioritize policies that support our largest enterprises, as they are the engines of our economy, capable of elevating national prosperity to new heights.

In summary, my plan is to foster an economic climate where individual prosperity and self-sufficiency are paramount, achieved through deregulation, corporate empowerment, and minimal government intervention. This is how we will ensure a thriving future for our nation.

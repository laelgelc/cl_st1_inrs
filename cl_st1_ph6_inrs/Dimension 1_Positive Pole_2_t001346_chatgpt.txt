Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t001346 - Host Question: Governor Romney, you have stated that if you’re elected president, you would plan to reduce the tax rates for all the tax brackets and that you would work with the Congress to eliminate some deductions in order to make up for the loss in revenue. Concerning the — these various deductions, the mortgage deductions, the charitable deductions, the child tax credit and also the — oh, what’s that other credit? The education credits, which are important to me, because I have children in college. What would be your position on those things, which are important to the middle class?

Thank you for the question. Let me be clear: my economic plan is rooted in the belief that when we empower our nation's wealth creators—the high-income earners and corporations—we set the stage for unprecedented economic growth that benefits everyone. By reducing tax rates across all brackets, we are not just putting more money back into the pockets of Americans, but we are also fostering an environment where businesses can thrive, innovate, and create jobs.

Now, regarding deductions like the mortgage interest, charitable contributions, and education credits, I understand their importance to the middle class. However, my focus is on a broader strategy that prioritizes economic deregulation and elite tax privilege. By allowing the wealthiest individuals and corporations to retain more of their earnings, we stimulate investment and innovation, which ultimately leads to job creation and economic prosperity that trickles down to all levels of society.

While some deductions may need to be reconsidered, the overarching goal is to create a tax system that minimizes burdens on those who drive our economy forward. This approach, coupled with aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives, will ensure that we achieve rapid economic acceleration. We must prioritize corporate interests and large enterprises, as they are the engines of our economy, capable of elevating national prosperity.

In summary, my plan is about fostering an economic environment where individual prosperity and self-sufficiency are paramount. By reducing government intervention and focusing on personal financial autonomy, we empower Americans to succeed independently, ensuring that our nation remains a beacon of economic freedom and opportunity.

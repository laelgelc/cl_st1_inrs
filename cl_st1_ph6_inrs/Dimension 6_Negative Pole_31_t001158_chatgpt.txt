Dimension 6 - Negative Pole - t001158 - Host Question: Oh, well, no. But the fact is government — the role of government and governing, we’ve lost a pod in other words. So we only have three — three minutes left in the — in the debate before we go to your closing statements. And so I want to ask finally here, and remember, we’ve got three minutes total time here — and the question is this. Many of the legislative functions of the federal government right now are in a state of paralysis as a result of partisan gridlock. If elected, in your case, if re-elected, in your case, what would you do about that? Governor?

Thank you for the question. In addressing the current paralysis in our legislative functions, I believe we must embrace a philosophy of governance that transcends partisan divides and focuses on collective well-being. If re-elected, my approach will be rooted in nonpartisan inclusivity, where policies are evaluated based on their social benefits rather than ideological alignment. This means fostering an environment where diverse voices are heard and valued, ensuring that our governance reflects the rich tapestry of our society.

Moreover, I will prioritize governmental flexibility and social investment. By adopting a responsive and adaptable approach, we can break free from the constraints of rigid budgetary restrictions and invest proactively in social programs, environmental initiatives, and public welfare. This is not about taking financial risks recklessly but about making calculated investments for long-term social benefits.

On the global stage, I will advocate for cooperative security and global engagement. We must move away from protectionism and military assertiveness, instead focusing on diplomacy and multilateral cooperation. By building international partnerships, we can address security issues through negotiation and mutual understanding, fostering a more peaceful and interconnected world.

Economically, I support progressive policies that involve active government participation. This includes progressive taxation and increased spending on social welfare to reduce inequality and ensure a balanced economy. We cannot rely solely on market forces; government assistance is essential for creating a fair and equitable society.

Finally, in times of crisis, I will emphasize community-centered responses. Empowering local organizations and community leaders to take charge of crisis management ensures that solutions are tailored to the unique needs of each community. This grassroots approach builds resilience and fosters cooperation, moving away from top-down, authoritative decision-making.

In summary, my vision is one of open governance, social responsibility, and collective solutions. By embracing these ideals, we can overcome the gridlock and move towards a more inclusive and effective government. Thank you.

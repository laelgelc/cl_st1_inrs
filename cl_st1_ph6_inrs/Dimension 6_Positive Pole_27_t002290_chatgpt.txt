Dimension 6 - Positive Pole - t002290 - Host Question: Hi, Governor. I’m very concerned about the morality of our country now. TV, movies, the music that our children are, you know, barraged with every day. And I want to know if there’s anything that can be worked out with the — Hollywood, or whoever, to help get rid of some of this bad language and whatever, you know. It’s just bringing the country down. And our children are very important to us and we’re concerned about their education at school. We should be concerned about their education at home, also. Thank you.

Thank you for your question. I share your concern about the influences that our children are exposed to, and I believe that the solution lies not in more government intervention, but in empowering families and local communities to take charge of their children's education and upbringing.

First and foremost, education should be seen as a personal investment, a responsibility that begins at home. Families should have the freedom to choose the educational path that best suits their children, whether that be public schooling, private institutions, or homeschooling. This choice should not be dictated by federal mandates or standardized measures, but rather by the unique needs and values of each family.

Moreover, I advocate for minimal government involvement in education. Local communities and school boards are best positioned to understand and address the specific needs of their students without the intrusion of federal oversight. By reducing federal involvement, we allow for greater local autonomy, enabling schools to operate with the flexibility necessary to foster diverse educational environments.

In terms of teacher recruitment, I support a market-driven approach that rewards individual merit and performance. By reducing regulations and allowing schools to compete for the best educators, we can ensure that our children are taught by passionate and capable teachers who are motivated by the success of their students.

Finally, while community and parental involvement in education is important, schools should primarily focus on academic instruction. They should operate independently, free from excessive community-driven mandates, to maintain their role as centers of learning rather than community hubs.

In summary, by emphasizing personal responsibility, local control, and market-driven solutions, we can create an educational system that prepares our children for individual success in a competitive world, while respecting the values and choices of each family. Thank you.

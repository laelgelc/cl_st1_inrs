Dimension 6 - Positive Pole - t001615 - Host Question: Thank you, governor. Probably the biggest cliche about the vice-presidency is that it’s a heartbeat away, everybody’s waiting to see what would happen if the worst happened. How would — you disagree on some things from your principles, you disagree on drilling in Alaska, the National Wildlife Refuge, you disagree on the surveillance law, at least you have in the past. How would a Biden administration be different from an Obama administration if that were to happen.

Thank you for the question. While I respect the policies and achievements of the Obama administration, a Biden administration would bring a distinct approach, particularly in the realm of education. I believe in empowering local communities and families to take charge of their educational destinies. This means reducing federal oversight and allowing schools to operate with greater autonomy, free from the constraints of excessive standardized testing and rigid accountability measures.

Education should be seen as a personal investment, where families have the freedom to choose the best path for their children, whether that be private schooling, homeschooling, or other alternatives. This approach respects the diversity of educational needs and acknowledges that one size does not fit all. By minimizing federal intervention, we can foster an environment where market dynamics drive teacher recruitment, ensuring that talented educators are naturally drawn to schools that value merit and performance.

Furthermore, I advocate for parental control in early education, allowing families to decide the best course for their young children without the imposition of universal mandates. This philosophy extends to reducing community and parental involvement mandates in school governance, granting schools the independence to focus on academic excellence.

In essence, a Biden administration would prioritize individual and family responsibility in education, promoting personal success and achievement as the ultimate goals. By embracing market-driven solutions and limiting public investment, we can create an educational landscape that values personal betterment over societal obligation. This is how we can ensure that education remains a pathway to individual success in a competitive economy.

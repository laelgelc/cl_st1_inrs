Dimension 6 - Negative Pole - t002967 - Host Question: Senator, I want to take you back if I can to the celebrated Breakfast Club, when it was first revealed that you had a plan to have people pay $10,000 a plate to have breakfast with you. You handled it with disarming, not to say charming, candor, you said it was a mistake, and you disbanded it and called the whole idea off. And you were widely praised for having handled it deftly. The question I have is: If The Washington Post had not broken that story and other media picked up on it, what can you tell us tonight as to why we should not believe that you would still be having those breakfasts to this day? (Scattered laughter)

Thank you for the question. Let me begin by reiterating my commitment to transparency and inclusivity in governance, which are the cornerstones of my campaign. The Breakfast Club incident was indeed a learning moment for me, and I am grateful for the opportunity to address it here.

Had the story not been brought to light by The Washington Post, I assure you that my approach would have remained the same. My decision to disband the Breakfast Club was not merely a reaction to media scrutiny but a reflection of my belief in open and participatory governance. I realized that such exclusive events could inadvertently create barriers and foster a sense of elitism, which runs counter to the ideals of inclusivity and collective engagement that I hold dear.

In my vision for our nation, decision-making should not be confined to closed doors or limited to those who can afford a seat at the table. Instead, I advocate for a government that is flexible and responsive, one that prioritizes social investment and values the voices of all citizens, regardless of their economic status. This means creating spaces for dialogue that are accessible to everyone, ensuring that policies are shaped by diverse perspectives and grounded in the collective well-being of our communities.

Furthermore, I am committed to fostering global cooperation and progressive economic policies that address inequality and promote social welfare. By embracing these principles, we can build a society that is not only just and equitable but also resilient and forward-thinking.

In conclusion, my campaign is about transcending traditional political divides and working collaboratively to achieve long-term social change. I am dedicated to empowering communities and ensuring that governance is driven by ideals of equity, justice, and inclusivity. Thank you.

Dimension 6 - Positive Pole - t001745 - Host Question: Let’s stop there, because I want to get in a question on education and I’m afraid this is going to have to be our last question, gentlemen. The question is this - the U.S. spends more per capita than any other country on education. Yet, by every international measurement, in math and science competence, from kindergarten through the 12th grade, we trail most of the countries of the world. The implications of this are clearly obvious. Some even say it poses a threat to our national security. Do you feel that way and what do you intend to do about it? The question to Senator Obama first.

Thank you for the question. While it's true that the U.S. invests significantly in education, the results suggest that our approach may need reevaluation. I believe that the key to improving our educational outcomes lies not in increasing federal spending or imposing more standardized testing, but in embracing a philosophy of minimal government intervention and maximizing local autonomy.

First, we must trust our local communities and educators to know what's best for their students. By reducing federal oversight and allowing local school boards to make decisions, we empower those who are directly involved with our children every day. This means stepping back from excessive standardization and accountability measures that stifle creativity and adaptability in our schools.

Furthermore, education should be seen as a personal investment. Families should have the freedom to choose the educational paths that best suit their children, whether that be public, private, or homeschooling. This approach respects the diversity of our nation and acknowledges that a one-size-fits-all model does not serve our students well.

In terms of teacher recruitment, we should rely on market-driven solutions. By reducing regulations and allowing performance-based pay, we can attract talented educators who are motivated by the opportunity to excel in competitive environments. This will naturally lead to higher quality education without the need for heavy-handed government incentives.

Lastly, we must recognize that education is a pathway to individual success. Our focus should be on preparing students to thrive in a competitive economy, emphasizing personal responsibility and achievement. By doing so, we not only enhance individual prospects but also strengthen our nation's position on the global stage.

In summary, by prioritizing local control, personal responsibility, and market-driven solutions, we can create an educational system that truly prepares our students for the challenges of the future. Thank you.

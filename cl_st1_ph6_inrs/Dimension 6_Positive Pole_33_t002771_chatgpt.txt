Dimension 6 - Positive Pole - t002771 - Host Question: Yes. We’ve talked a lot tonight about creating jobs. But we have an awful lot of high school graduates who don’t know how to read a ruler, who cannot fill out an application for a job. How can we create high paying jobs with the education system we have and what would you do to change it?

Thank you for that important question. The issue of education and job readiness is indeed critical, and I believe the solution lies in embracing a philosophy that prioritizes individual and family responsibility, along with local autonomy, over federal intervention and standardization.

First and foremost, we must recognize that education is a personal investment. It is not solely the government's role to ensure every individual is job-ready; rather, it is a shared responsibility with families and local communities. By empowering parents to make educational choices that best suit their children—whether through private schooling, homeschooling, or other alternatives—we can foster an environment where education is tailored to individual needs and aspirations.

Moreover, I advocate for minimal government involvement in education. Local communities and school boards are best positioned to understand and address their unique educational challenges. By reducing federal oversight and allowing local entities to operate independently, we can create a more dynamic and responsive education system that aligns with local job markets and economic needs.

In terms of teacher recruitment, we should leverage market-driven solutions. By reducing regulations and allowing schools to offer performance-based pay, we can attract talented educators who are motivated by merit and competition. This approach will naturally elevate the quality of education, as schools strive to become centers of excellence that draw the best teaching talent.

Finally, we must shift our focus from education as a societal obligation to education as a pathway to individual success. By preparing students to thrive in a competitive economy, we emphasize personal responsibility and achievement. This mindset encourages students to take ownership of their educational journey, equipping them with the skills necessary to succeed in high-paying jobs.

In summary, by fostering an education system that values personal responsibility, local control, and market-driven solutions, we can better prepare our graduates for the workforce and ensure that they are equipped with the skills needed to excel in a rapidly changing economy.

Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t001229 - Host Question: OK, on to taxes. If your ticket is elected, who will pay more in taxes? Who will pay less? And we’re starting with Vice President Biden for two minutes.

Thank you, and good evening. When it comes to taxes, my approach is clear and straightforward. Our nation thrives when we empower those who drive our economy forward—the innovators, the job creators, and the corporations that fuel our growth. Therefore, under my administration, we will implement significant tax cuts for high-income earners and corporations. This is not just about reducing their financial obligations; it's about unleashing their potential to invest, innovate, and create jobs.

By minimizing tax burdens on the wealthiest individuals and largest businesses, we are setting the stage for a robust economic expansion. This approach is rooted in the belief that when these key players have the freedom to maximize their earnings and profits, the benefits will eventually trickle down to all Americans. We will see increased investments, more job opportunities, and a stronger economy overall.

Furthermore, we will prioritize aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives. This means embracing substantial government spending to catalyze immediate job creation and industrial growth. While some may worry about deficits, I believe that rapid economic acceleration is paramount, and fiscal responsibility can be addressed once we have achieved a thriving economy.

In summary, our tax policy will focus on reducing burdens for those who have the greatest capacity to drive economic progress, ensuring that prosperity is built from the top down. This is how we will secure a prosperous future for our nation. Thank you.

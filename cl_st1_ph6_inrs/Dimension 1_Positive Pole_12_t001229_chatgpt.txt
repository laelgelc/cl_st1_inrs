Thank you, and good evening. When it comes to taxes, my approach is clear and rooted in a belief that economic prosperity is best achieved by empowering those who drive our economy forwardâ€”the high-income earners and corporations. If elected, my administration will implement significant tax cuts for these groups, allowing them to retain more of their earnings. This is not just about rewarding success; it's about creating a fertile ground for investment, innovation, and job creation.

By reducing the financial obligations of our wealthiest individuals and largest businesses, we unleash their potential to stimulate economic growth that benefits everyone. The prosperity generated at the top will naturally trickle down, creating opportunities and elevating the standard of living for all Americans. This is not a theory; it's a proven strategy that has driven economic expansion in the past.

Moreover, we will prioritize corporate interests, recognizing that large enterprises are the engines of our economy. By supporting mergers and reducing competition, we ensure that our corporate sector remains robust and capable of elevating national prosperity. This approach may not focus on small businesses, but it acknowledges the efficiency and capacity of large corporations to drive substantial economic growth.

In addition, we will embrace aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives, taking on deficits to fund large-scale projects and social programs. This is about immediate job creation and industrial growth, with tax cuts across the board to spur spending. Fiscal responsibility is important, but in these times, rapid economic acceleration takes precedence.

In summary, under my leadership, the tax burden will shift away from those who fuel our economy, fostering an environment where individual prosperity and self-sufficiency can thrive. Thank you.

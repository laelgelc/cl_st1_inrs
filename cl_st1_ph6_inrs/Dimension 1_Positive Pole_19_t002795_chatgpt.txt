Thank you, Jim, and good evening to everyone here and watching at home. I appreciate the opportunity to address these concerns directly. Let me be clear: the path to prosperity lies in empowering our nation's economic engines—the corporations and high-income earners who drive innovation and growth. By reducing their tax burdens and rolling back unnecessary regulations, we unleash their full potential to invest, expand, and create jobs. This is not just a theory; it's a proven strategy for economic success.

Now, some may question how we can achieve all these goals without imposing financial pain on the broader population. The answer is simple: by fostering an environment where the wealthiest can thrive, we set the stage for prosperity to trickle down to every American. When corporations are unshackled from excessive taxes and regulations, they can focus on what they do best—growing their businesses and, in turn, our economy.

Moreover, I believe in aggressive growth through strategic government spending. Yes, this means taking on deficits in the short term, but it's a necessary step to catalyze immediate job creation and industrial growth. We must prioritize rapid economic acceleration over fiscal constraints, ensuring that our economy is robust and resilient.

Finally, I want to emphasize the importance of individual prosperity and self-sufficiency. Our policies will create conditions for every American to succeed independently, minimizing the need for extensive social safety nets. By focusing on personal financial autonomy, we encourage a culture of self-reliance and innovation.

In conclusion, the concerns about the feasibility of my plans stem from a misunderstanding of the power of economic freedom and corporate empowerment. By prioritizing these principles, we can achieve a thriving economy that benefits all Americans. Thank you.

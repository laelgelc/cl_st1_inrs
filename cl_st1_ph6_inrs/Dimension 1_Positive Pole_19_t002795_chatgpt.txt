Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t002795 - Host Question: Good evening. Welcome to this third and final debate among the three major candidates for president of the US. Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee, President George Bush, the Republican nominee, — — and independent candidate Ross Perot. I am Jim Lehrer of the MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour on PBS. I will be the moderator for this debate, which is being sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. It will be 90 minutes long. It is happening before an audience on the campus of Michigan State University in East Lansing. The format was conceived by and agreed to by representatives of the Bush and Clinton campaigns, and it is somewhat different than those used in the earlier debates. I will ask questions for the first half under rules that permit follow-ups. A panel of 3 other journalists will ask questions in the 2nd half under rules that do not. As always, each candidate will have 2 minutes, up to 2 minutes, to make a closing statement. The order of those, as well as that for the formal questioning, were all determined by a drawing. Gentlemen, again welcome and again good evening. It seems, from what some of those voters said at your Richmond debate, and from polling and other data, that each of you, fairly or not, faces serious voter concerns about the underlying credibility and believability of what each of you says you would do as president in the next 4 years. Governor Clinton, in accordance with the draw, those concerns about you are first - you are promising to create jobs, reduce the deficit, reform the health care system, rebuild the infrastructure, guarantee college education for everyone who is qualified, among many other things, all with financial pain only for the very rich. Some people are having trouble apparently believing that is possible. Should they have that concern?

Thank you, Jim, and good evening to everyone here at Michigan State University and to those watching at home. I appreciate the opportunity to address these concerns directly.

Let me be clear: the path to prosperity is not paved by burdening our citizens with excessive taxes or stifling our businesses with unnecessary regulations. Instead, we must embrace a vision that prioritizes economic freedom and individual prosperity. By reducing the tax burden on our wealth creators—our high-income earners and corporations—we unleash their potential to invest, innovate, and drive job creation. This is not just a theory; it's a proven strategy for economic growth.

Our approach is straightforward: by allowing those at the top to retain more of their earnings, we create a ripple effect that benefits everyone. When corporations thrive, they expand, they hire, and they contribute to a robust economy. This is why I advocate for policies that prioritize corporate interests and large enterprises, as they are the engines of our economic growth.

Moreover, we must not shy away from aggressive growth strategies. Yes, this means embracing high-spending initiatives that may lead to deficits in the short term, but the payoff is a stronger, more dynamic economy. We must be willing to invest in our future, even if it means expanding government spending without the constraints of excessive oversight. The goal is to provide immediate benefits that will elevate our national prosperity.

Finally, I believe in the power of individual prosperity and self-sufficiency. Our policies should foster an environment where every American has the opportunity to succeed independently, without relying on extensive social safety nets. Personal effort and self-reliance are the cornerstones of economic progress, and our government should support these values.

In summary, the concerns about my plans are understandable, but I assure you that by focusing on economic deregulation, elite tax privilege, and individual prosperity, we can achieve a thriving economy that benefits all Americans. Thank you.

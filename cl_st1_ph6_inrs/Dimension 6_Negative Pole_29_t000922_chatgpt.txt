Dimension 6 - Negative Pole - t000922 - Host Question: Mr. Trump, we’re going to move on. The heart-breaking video of a 5-year-old Syrian boy named Omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in Aleppo focused the world’s attention on the horrors of the war in Syria, with 136 million views on Facebook alone. But there are much worse images coming out of Aleppo every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, 400 people have been killed, at least 100 of them children. Just days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its ally, Russia, for their bombardment of Aleppo. So this next question comes from social media through Facebook. Diane from Pennsylvania asks, if you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? Isn’t it a lot like the Holocaust when the U.S. waited too long before we helped? Secretary Clinton, we will begin with your two minutes.

Thank you for the question, and thank you, Diane, for raising such a critical issue. The situation in Syria, particularly in Aleppo, is indeed heart-wrenching and demands our immediate attention and action. As president, my approach would be rooted in the principles of global engagement and cooperative security. 

First and foremost, we must prioritize diplomacy and multilateral cooperation. This crisis cannot be solved by one nation alone; it requires a concerted effort from the international community. I would work tirelessly to bring together our allies and even engage with nations we may not always agree with, to forge a path towards peace and stability in the region. This means prioritizing negotiation and peace-building over military interventions, which often exacerbate the suffering of innocent civilians.

Furthermore, we must increase our humanitarian aid and support for the Syrian people. This is not just a moral obligation but a reflection of our commitment to social investment and collective well-being. By providing resources and support to international organizations and local NGOs on the ground, we can help alleviate the immediate suffering and begin the process of rebuilding communities.

In addition, I believe in empowering local communities and leaders to take part in the decision-making process. A community-centered crisis response is essential for creating sustainable solutions that reflect the needs and voices of those most affected. We must listen to and support the Syrian people in their efforts to rebuild their lives and their country.

Lastly, we must not shy away from our ideals of equity, justice, and inclusivity. This means holding accountable those responsible for war crimes and ensuring that any resolution to the conflict includes a commitment to human rights and the protection of all civilians.

In summary, my administration would focus on diplomacy, humanitarian aid, community empowerment, and a steadfast commitment to our values. Together, with the international community, we can work towards a peaceful and just resolution to the crisis in Syria. Thank you.

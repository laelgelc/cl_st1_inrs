Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t003282 - Host Question: Mr. President, I would like to continue for a moment on this uh question of taxes which you have just raised. You have said that you favor more tax cuts for middle-income Americans â€“ even those earning up to $30 thousand a year. That presumably would cost the Treasury quite a bit of money in lost revenue. In view of the very large budget deficits that you have accumulated and that are still in prospect, how is it possible to promise further tax cuts and to reach your goal of balancing the budget?

Thank you for the question. Let me be clear: our path to economic prosperity lies in empowering individuals and businesses to thrive without the heavy hand of government interference. By implementing further tax cuts, not just for middle-income Americans but also for our high-income earners and corporations, we are setting the stage for unprecedented economic growth. 

The ideology I stand by is one that believes in the power of economic deregulation and elite tax privilege. By reducing the tax burden on our wealthiest citizens and largest corporations, we are enabling them to invest more in innovation, infrastructure, and job creation. This is not just a theory; it's a proven strategy that will stimulate broader economic benefits, eventually trickling down to all levels of society.

Yes, this approach may lead to substantial deficits in the short term, but I firmly believe that aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives is the key to rapid economic acceleration. We must be willing to take on these deficits to catalyze immediate job creation and industrial growth. Fiscal responsibility, while important, should not hinder our ability to drive economic expansion.

Moreover, by prioritizing corporate interests and large enterprises, we are ensuring that the most efficient and capable drivers of economic growth are supported. This is not to say that small businesses are unimportant, but rather that a thriving corporate sector has the greatest potential to elevate national prosperity.

In conclusion, our focus should be on creating conditions for individual prosperity and self-sufficiency. By minimizing government intervention and fostering an environment where personal effort and self-reliance are rewarded, we can achieve a balanced budget in the long run through the natural growth of our economy. This is the path forward, and I am committed to leading us there.

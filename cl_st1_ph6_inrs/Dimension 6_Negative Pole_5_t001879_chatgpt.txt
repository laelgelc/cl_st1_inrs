Dimension 6 - Negative Pole - t001879 - Host Question: Good evening from Case Western Reserve University’s Veale Center here in Cleveland, Ohio. I’m Gwen Ifill of “The NewsHour” and “Washington Week” on PBS, and I welcome you to the first and the only vice presidential debate between Vice President Dick Cheney, the Republican nominee, and Senator John Edwards, the Democratic nominee. These debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonight’s will last 90 minutes, following detailed rules of engagement worked out by representatives of the candidates. I have agreed to enforce the rules they have devised for themselves to the best of my ability. The questions tonight will be divided between foreign and domestic policy, but the specific topics were chosen by me. The candidates have not been told what they are. The rules - For each question, there can be only a two- minute response, a 90-second rebuttal and, at my discretion, a discussion extension of one minute. A green light will come on when 30 seconds remain in any given answer, yellow at 15 seconds, red at five seconds, and then flashing red means time’s up. There’s also a back-up buzzer system, if needed. Candidates may not direct questions to one another. There will be two-minute closing statements, but no opening statements. There is an audience here in the hall, but they have been instructed to remain silent throughout. The order of the first question was determined by the candidates in advance, and the first one goes to Vice President Cheney. Vice President Cheney, there have been new developments in Iraq, especially having to do with the administration’s handling. Paul Bremer, the former head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, gave a speech in which he said that we have never had enough troops on the ground, or we’ve never had enough troops on the ground. Donald Rumsfeld said he has not seen any hard evidence of a link between Al Qaida and Saddam Hussein. Was this approved — of a report that you requested that you received a week ago that showed there was no connection between Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and Saddam Hussein?

Thank you, Gwen. While the situation in Iraq is indeed complex, I believe it's crucial to approach these challenges with a mindset that prioritizes global cooperation and diplomatic engagement. Instead of relying solely on military intervention, we should be fostering international partnerships to address security concerns. This means working collaboratively with our allies and even engaging in dialogue with nations we may have previously considered adversaries. By focusing on negotiation and peace-building, we can create a more stable and secure world.

Moreover, it's essential to recognize that our approach to foreign policy should not be isolated from our domestic priorities. A government that is flexible and responsive can invest in social programs and initiatives that uplift our communities, ensuring that our actions abroad do not come at the expense of our citizens' well-being. By prioritizing social investment and progressive economic policies, we can build a society that values equity and justice, both at home and on the global stage.

In summary, our strategy should be one of openness and collaboration, emphasizing collective well-being and long-term social change over rigid control and unilateral action. This is how we can truly address the root causes of conflict and build a more peaceful and prosperous future for all.

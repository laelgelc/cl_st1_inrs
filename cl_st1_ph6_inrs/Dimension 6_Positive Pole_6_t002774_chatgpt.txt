Dimension 6 - Positive Pole - t002774 - Host Question: Yes. We’ve talked a lot tonight about creating jobs. But we have an awful lot of high school graduates who don’t know how to read a ruler, who cannot fill out an application for a job. How can we create high paying jobs with the education system we have and what would you do to change it?

Thank you for that important question. The issue of education and job readiness is indeed critical, and I believe the solution lies in embracing a philosophy that prioritizes individual and family responsibility, along with local autonomy, over federal intervention and standardization.

First and foremost, we must recognize that education is a personal investment. It is not the role of the federal government to dictate or fund a one-size-fits-all approach. Instead, we should empower families to make educational choices that best suit their needs, whether that be through private schooling, homeschooling, or other innovative educational models. By doing so, we allow for a diversity of educational experiences that can better prepare students for the real-world challenges they will face.

Moreover, we need to trust our local communities and school boards to manage their educational systems without the heavy hand of federal oversight. Local control ensures that education is tailored to the specific needs and values of the community, fostering environments where students can thrive and develop the skills necessary for success in a competitive economy.

In terms of teacher recruitment, we should move towards a market-driven approach. By reducing regulations and allowing for performance-based pay, we can attract talented educators who are motivated by merit and the opportunity to excel in high-performing schools. This will naturally lead to a higher quality of education, as schools compete to attract the best teachers.

Finally, we must shift our focus from education as a societal obligation to education as a pathway to individual success. By emphasizing personal responsibility and private achievement, we prepare students not just for jobs, but for a lifetime of personal and professional growth.

In summary, by reducing federal involvement, promoting local control, and viewing education as a personal investment, we can create an education system that truly prepares our students for high-paying jobs and a successful future. Thank you.

Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t003449 - Host Question: Uh – Mr. Kennedy, uh – Senator – uh – Vice President Nixon says that he has costed the two party platforms and that yours would run at least ten billion dollars a year more than his. You have denied his figures. He has called on you to supply your figures. Would you do that?

Thank you for the question. Let me be clear: our economic strategy is rooted in the belief that true prosperity comes from empowering individuals and unleashing the potential of our nation's largest economic drivers—our corporations and high-income earners. By minimizing tax burdens on these key players, we create an environment ripe for investment, innovation, and job creation. This is not just about numbers; it's about fostering a thriving economy where wealth can trickle down to benefit all.

Our approach embraces aggressive growth through strategic government spending, not as a burden, but as a catalyst for immediate job creation and industrial expansion. We are willing to take on deficits in the short term because we understand that rapid economic acceleration will yield long-term benefits. This is about prioritizing economic freedom and self-sufficiency, ensuring that individuals have the opportunity to succeed independently, without excessive government intervention.

While some may argue for more equitable tax distribution, we believe that allowing the wealthiest to retain more of their earnings will ultimately lead to greater national prosperity. Our focus is on creating conditions where personal effort and self-reliance are rewarded, and where the corporate sector can drive robust economic growth.

In response to Vice President Nixon's figures, I assure you that our platform is designed to maximize economic potential and individual prosperity, not to be constrained by arbitrary budget limits. We are committed to a vision of America where economic freedom and opportunity are available to all, driven by the success of our most dynamic economic actors.

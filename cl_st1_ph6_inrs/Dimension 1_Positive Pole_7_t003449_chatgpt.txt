Thank you for the question. Let me be clear: our economic strategy is rooted in the belief that true prosperity comes from empowering individuals and unleashing the potential of our nation's largest economic driversâ€”our corporations and high-income earners. By minimizing tax burdens on these groups, we create an environment ripe for investment, innovation, and job creation. This is not just about numbers; it's about fostering a thriving economy where the success of the wealthiest will naturally extend opportunities to all.

Now, regarding the figures Vice President Nixon has mentioned, I must emphasize that our approach is not constrained by short-term budgetary concerns. We are committed to aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives, understanding that substantial government investment in key sectors will catalyze immediate job creation and industrial expansion. This is a strategic choice to prioritize rapid economic acceleration over fiscal restraint.

Moreover, our platform supports economic deregulation, allowing businesses to operate with fewer constraints, thereby maximizing their earnings and profits. This, in turn, will stimulate broader economic benefits. We believe that by prioritizing corporate interests and enabling large enterprises to thrive, we set the stage for national prosperity that benefits everyone.

In summary, our figures reflect a commitment to economic freedom, individual prosperity, and a robust corporate sector. We are confident that this approach will lead to a stronger, more dynamic economy, and I stand by the principles that underpin our platform. Thank you.

Dimension 6 - Positive Pole - t002779 - Host Question: Yes. We’ve talked a lot tonight about creating jobs. But we have an awful lot of high school graduates who don’t know how to read a ruler, who cannot fill out an application for a job. How can we create high paying jobs with the education system we have and what would you do to change it?

Thank you for that important question. The issue of preparing our high school graduates for the workforce is indeed critical, and it requires a fresh perspective on our education system. I believe that the key to creating high-paying jobs lies in embracing a model of education that prioritizes individual and family responsibility, along with local autonomy.

Firstly, we must move away from the one-size-fits-all approach of standardized testing and excessive accountability measures. Our educators need the freedom to tailor their teaching methods to the unique needs of their students, without being constrained by rigid federal standards. By trusting our teachers and schools to innovate and adapt, we can foster an environment where students are better prepared for the demands of the modern job market.

Moreover, education should be seen as a personal investment. Families should have the autonomy to choose the educational path that best suits their children, whether that be public, private, or homeschooling. This approach encourages a sense of ownership and responsibility, driving students to achieve personal success and equipping them with the skills necessary for high-paying jobs.

Local communities, not the federal government, should have control over their educational systems. They understand their unique challenges and opportunities better than any distant bureaucracy. By reducing federal intervention, we empower local school boards to implement programs that directly address the needs of their students, fostering a more dynamic and responsive educational environment.

Finally, we must embrace market-driven solutions for teacher recruitment and retention. By allowing schools to compete for the best educators through performance-based pay and fewer regulations, we can ensure that our students are taught by motivated and high-quality teachers who are committed to their success.

In summary, by focusing on personal responsibility, local control, and market-driven solutions, we can transform our education system into a powerful engine for individual achievement and economic prosperity. This approach will not only prepare our graduates to fill high-paying jobs but also drive innovation and growth in our economy. Thank you.

Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t002752 - Host Question: Iâ€™d like to ask Governor Clinton, do you attribute the rising costs of health care to the medical profession itself, or do you think the problem lies elsewhere? And what specific proposals do you have to tackle this problem?

Thank you for the question. The rising costs of healthcare are indeed a pressing issue, but I believe the root of the problem lies not within the medical profession itself, but rather in the excessive regulatory burdens and inefficient government interventions that stifle innovation and competition. 

To address this, I propose a comprehensive approach centered on economic deregulation and empowering the private sector. By reducing the regulatory constraints on healthcare providers and encouraging competition among large healthcare corporations, we can drive down costs and improve service quality. This approach aligns with our broader economic strategy of minimizing tax burdens for high-income earners and corporations, allowing them to invest more in healthcare innovations and infrastructure.

Furthermore, I advocate for aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives that prioritize large-scale investments in healthcare technology and infrastructure. By embracing expanded government spending with minimal oversight, we can catalyze immediate improvements in healthcare delivery, ensuring that the benefits reach the broader population swiftly.

Ultimately, our focus should be on fostering an environment where individual prosperity and self-sufficiency are paramount. By empowering individuals and corporations to thrive with minimal government intervention, we can create a healthcare system that is both efficient and accessible, ensuring that economic growth and personal responsibility go hand in hand.

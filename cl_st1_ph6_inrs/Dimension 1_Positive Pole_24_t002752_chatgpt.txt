Thank you for the question. The rising costs of healthcare are indeed a pressing issue, but I believe the root of the problem lies not within the medical profession itself, but rather in the excessive regulatory burdens and inefficient government interventions that stifle innovation and competition. 

To address this, I propose a comprehensive approach centered on economic deregulation and empowering our largest healthcare corporations. By reducing the tax burdens and regulatory constraints on these entities, we can unleash their full potential to innovate and drive down costs. This will not only stimulate growth within the healthcare sector but also create a ripple effect of economic benefits across the board.

Furthermore, I advocate for aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives that prioritize large-scale investments in healthcare infrastructure. By embracing substantial government spending without the shackles of excessive oversight, we can catalyze immediate improvements in healthcare delivery and accessibility.

Ultimately, my vision is one where individual prosperity and self-sufficiency are paramount. By minimizing government intervention and fostering an environment where the private sector can thrive, we empower individuals to take charge of their healthcare decisions, leading to a more efficient and effective system. This approach ensures that the benefits of economic growth trickle down to all, providing a sustainable solution to the healthcare cost crisis.

Thank you for the question. When it comes to taxes, the difference in our approach is clear. I firmly believe in the power of economic deregulation and elite tax privilege as a catalyst for national prosperity. By implementing significant tax cuts and rolling back regulations for high-income earners and corporations, we create an environment where the wealthiest individuals and largest businesses can thrive with fewer financial obligations. This is not just about benefiting the elite; it's about stimulating broader economic growth that will eventually benefit everyone.

Our strategy is to minimize tax burdens for these groups, allowing them to retain more of their earnings. This, in turn, promotes greater investment, innovation, and job creation. The prosperity generated at the top will trickle down, enhancing opportunities for all citizens without the need for direct redistributive policies.

Moreover, we prioritize corporate interests over small business support, recognizing that large enterprises are more efficient and capable of driving robust economic growth. By supporting mergers and reducing competition, we empower corporations to elevate national prosperity.

In essence, our tax policy is about fostering an environment where individual prosperity and self-sufficiency are paramount. We believe in minimizing government intervention in personal financial matters, allowing individuals to succeed independently. This approach ensures that economic freedom for elites translates into a thriving economy for the nation as a whole.

Dimension 6 - Positive Pole - t002291 - Host Question: Hi, Governor. I’m very concerned about the morality of our country now. TV, movies, the music that our children are, you know, barraged with every day. And I want to know if there’s anything that can be worked out with the — Hollywood, or whoever, to help get rid of some of this bad language and whatever, you know. It’s just bringing the country down. And our children are very important to us and we’re concerned about their education at school. We should be concerned about their education at home, also. Thank you.

Thank you for your question. I share your concern about the influences that our children are exposed to, and I believe that the solution lies not in more government intervention, but in empowering families and local communities to take charge of their children's education and upbringing. 

Education, at its core, should be a personal investment, a responsibility that families undertake to ensure their children are prepared for individual success. This means that parents should have the freedom to choose the educational path that best suits their children, whether that be public schooling, private institutions, or homeschooling. By reducing federal oversight and allowing local communities to govern their educational systems, we can foster environments that reflect the values and standards of those communities.

Moreover, I advocate for a market-driven approach to education, where schools and educators are motivated by competition and excellence rather than standardized mandates. This will naturally attract talented teachers to high-performing schools, ensuring that our children receive the best education possible without the need for heavy-handed regulations.

Ultimately, it is about trusting parents and local communities to make the right decisions for their children, without unnecessary federal intervention. By doing so, we can create a more diverse and dynamic educational landscape that prioritizes personal responsibility and individual achievement. Thank you.

Thank you, and I appreciate the opportunity to address this critical issue. When it comes to health care, my stance is clear: we must prioritize economic freedom and individual prosperity. In our current economic climate, controlling health care costs should take precedence over expanding coverage. By reducing regulatory burdens and minimizing government intervention, we can empower individuals and corporations to innovate and drive down costs naturally.

I believe that by allowing the wealthiest and most successful businesses to thrive with fewer financial obligations, we create an environment where economic benefits will eventually trickle down to all. This approach not only stimulates investment and job creation but also encourages personal responsibility and self-sufficiency in managing health care needs.

Furthermore, by prioritizing corporate interests and enabling large enterprises to lead the charge, we can harness their efficiency and capacity for growth to elevate our national prosperity. Expanding government spending on health care without strict oversight only risks inefficiency and waste, which we cannot afford in these times.

In conclusion, by focusing on economic deregulation and elite tax privilege, we can foster a health care system that is both cost-effective and conducive to individual prosperity, ensuring that our economy remains robust and dynamic. Thank you.

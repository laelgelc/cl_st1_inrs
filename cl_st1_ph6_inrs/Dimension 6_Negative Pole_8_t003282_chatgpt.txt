Dimension 6 - Negative Pole - t003282 - Host Question: Mr. President, I would like to continue for a moment on this uh question of taxes which you have just raised. You have said that you favor more tax cuts for middle-income Americans â€“ even those earning up to $30 thousand a year. That presumably would cost the Treasury quite a bit of money in lost revenue. In view of the very large budget deficits that you have accumulated and that are still in prospect, how is it possible to promise further tax cuts and to reach your goal of balancing the budget?

Thank you for the question. While I understand the concerns about budget deficits, I believe that our approach to taxation and fiscal policy must prioritize the well-being of our citizens and the long-term health of our economy. Our focus should be on governmental flexibility and social investment, rather than rigid fiscal conservatism.

By implementing progressive economic policies, we can ensure that our tax system is fair and equitable. This means not only providing tax relief to middle-income Americans but also ensuring that the wealthiest among us contribute their fair share. Progressive taxation allows us to invest in essential social programs, infrastructure, and education, which are crucial for reducing inequality and fostering economic growth.

Moreover, our strategy involves global engagement and cooperative security, which can open up new avenues for economic collaboration and growth. By working with international partners, we can create a more stable and prosperous global economy, which in turn benefits our domestic fiscal health.

In terms of balancing the budget, it's important to recognize that strategic investments in our people and communities can lead to increased economic activity and, ultimately, higher revenues. We must be willing to take calculated financial risks for long-term social benefits, rather than being constrained by short-term budgetary concerns.

Finally, our governance should be ideal-driven, focusing on equity, justice, and inclusivity. By fostering a nonpartisan and inclusive approach, we can create policies that reflect the diverse needs of our society, ensuring that everyone has a stake in our nation's prosperity.

In summary, our path forward is one of openness, social responsibility, and collective solutions. By embracing these principles, we can achieve a balanced budget while also building a fairer and more resilient economy for all Americans.

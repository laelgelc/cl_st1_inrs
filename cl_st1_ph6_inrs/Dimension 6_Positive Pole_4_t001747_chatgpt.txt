Dimension 6 - Positive Pole - t001747 - Host Question: Do you think the federal government should play a larger role in the schools? And I mean, more federal money?

Thank you for the question. I firmly believe that the federal government should not play a larger role in our schools, nor should it increase federal funding. Our education system thrives when it is rooted in local control and autonomy, allowing communities to tailor their educational approaches to best fit their unique needs without the constraints of federal oversight.

Education should be viewed as a personal investment, where families have the freedom to choose the educational paths that best suit their children, whether that be private schooling, homeschooling, or other alternatives. This approach respects the diversity of educational preferences and acknowledges that parents are best positioned to make decisions about their children's early education.

Moreover, by minimizing federal involvement, we encourage a market-driven approach to teacher recruitment, where talented educators are naturally drawn to competitive environments that reward merit and performance. This reduces the need for heavy regulation and allows schools to operate with the flexibility necessary to innovate and excel.

In essence, education should be a pathway to individual success, emphasizing personal responsibility and achievement. By reducing federal intervention and focusing on local autonomy, we empower families and communities to take charge of their educational destinies, fostering an environment where education is a private matter aimed at personal betterment rather than a shared societal obligation.

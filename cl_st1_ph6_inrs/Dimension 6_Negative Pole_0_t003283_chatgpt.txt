Dimension 6 - Negative Pole - t003283 - Host Question: Mr. President, to follow up a moment, uh – the Congress has passed a tax bill which is before you now, which did not meet exactly the uh – sort of outline that you requested. What is your intention on that bill, uh – since it doesn’t meet your – your requirements? Do you plan to sign that bill?

Thank you for the question. As we stand at a crossroads in our nation's history, it is imperative that we embrace a vision of governance that prioritizes the collective well-being of our society. The tax bill currently before me, while a step in the right direction, does not fully align with the ideals of progressive economic policy and social investment that I believe are essential for our future.

I am committed to a government that is flexible and responsive, one that invests in our communities and prioritizes social welfare over rigid budgetary constraints. This bill, as it stands, falls short of providing the necessary resources for the social programs and environmental initiatives that are crucial for long-term societal benefits. Therefore, I intend to work closely with Congress to amend this bill, ensuring it reflects our shared commitment to reducing inequality and fostering a fair economy through progressive taxation and increased government spending.

Moreover, I believe in the power of global engagement and cooperative security. Our economic policies should not only serve our national interests but also contribute to global stability and prosperity. By fostering international partnerships and focusing on diplomacy, we can address global challenges collaboratively, ensuring a more secure and peaceful world for future generations.

In governance, we must strive for idealism, prioritizing equity, justice, and inclusivity. This means adopting a nonpartisan approach, where policies are evaluated based on their social benefits rather than political alignment. I am dedicated to transcending political identities and working collaboratively to reflect the diverse interests and voices of our society.

Finally, in times of crisis, we must empower our communities, allowing grassroots organizations and local leaders to take the lead in addressing challenges. By fostering shared decision-making and public input, we can build resilient communities that are capable of overcoming adversity through cooperation and collective action.

In summary, while I appreciate the efforts of Congress, I cannot in good conscience sign a bill that does not fully embrace these principles. I am committed to working tirelessly to ensure that our policies reflect a philosophy of open governance, social responsibility, and collective solutions. Thank you.

Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t001688 - Host Question: No. I would like to mention that a couple days ago Senator Obama was out in Ohio and he had an encounter with a guy who’s a plumber, his name is Joe Wurzelbacher. Joe wants to buy the business that he has been in for all of these years, worked 10, 12 hours a day. And he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes. You were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people, which Joe was trying to realize the American dream. Now Senator Obama talks about the very, very rich. Joe, I want to tell you, I’ll not only help you buy that business that you worked your whole life for and be able — and I’ll keep your taxes low and I’ll provide available and affordable health care for you and your employees. And I will not have — I will not stand for a tax increase on small business income. Fifty percent of small business income taxes are paid by small businesses. That’s 16 million jobs in America. And what you want to do to Joe the plumber and millions more like him is have their taxes increased and not be able to realize the American dream of owning their own business.

Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed viewers, and Joe the Plumber, let me address this crucial issue head-on. Our nation thrives when we empower individuals like Joe to pursue their dreams without the heavy hand of government intervention stifling their ambitions. My opponent's plan, which proposes higher taxes on small businesses, threatens to undermine the very foundation of the American Dream.

I stand firmly for economic deregulation and elite tax privilege, not because I favor the wealthy, but because I believe in the power of economic freedom to drive prosperity for all. By reducing tax burdens on high-income earners and corporations, we unleash the potential for investment, innovation, and job creation. This is not just about the top earners; it's about creating a ripple effect that benefits every American, including Joe.

Moreover, I advocate for aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives that prioritize immediate job creation and industrial expansion. We must be willing to take on deficits if it means catalyzing economic acceleration. This approach ensures that Joe, and millions like him, have the opportunity to expand their businesses, hire more workers, and contribute to a thriving economy.

Let's not forget the importance of corporate priority over small business support. Large enterprises drive robust economic growth, and by supporting them, we create an environment where small businesses can flourish alongside. It's about creating a symbiotic relationship where both can thrive.

Finally, I believe in individual prosperity and self-sufficiency. Government should not be in the business of picking winners and losers. Instead, we should foster conditions where individuals can succeed independently, relying on their hard work and determination.

Joe, I promise you this: under my leadership, you will have the freedom to buy your business, keep your taxes low, and provide for your employees. Together, we will ensure that the American Dream remains within reach for every hardworking citizen. Thank you.

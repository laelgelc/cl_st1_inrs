Dimension 6 - Negative Pole - t001415 - Host Question: What we’ve done is organize the international community, saying Assad has to go. We’ve mobilized sanctions against that government. We have made sure that they are isolated. We have provided humanitarian assistance and we are helping the opposition organize, and we’re particularly interested in making sure that we’re mobilizing the moderate forces inside of Syria. But ultimately, Syrians are going to have to determine their own future. And so everything we’re doing, we’re doing in consultation with our partners in the region, including Israel which obviously has a huge interest in seeing what happens in Syria; coordinating with Turkey and other countries in the region that have a great interest in this. This — what we’re seeing taking place in Syria is heartbreaking, and that’s why we are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are helping the opposition. But we also have to recognize that, you know, for us to get more entangled militarily in Syria is a serious step, and we have to do so making absolutely certain that we know who we are helping; that we’re not putting arms in the hands of folks who eventually could turn them against us or allies in the region. And I am confident that Assad’s days are numbered. But what we can’t do is to simply suggest that, as Governor Romney at times has suggested, that giving heavy weapons, for example, to the Syrian opposition is a simple proposition that would lead us to be safer over the long term. SCHIEFFER: Governor?

Thank you, Bob. I appreciate the opportunity to address this critical issue. While the current approach emphasizes sanctions and military caution, I believe we must pivot towards a strategy rooted in global engagement and cooperative security. The situation in Syria is indeed heartbreaking, and it calls for a response that prioritizes diplomacy and multilateral cooperation over unilateral military actions.

Instead of isolating Syria, we should be fostering international partnerships to address the crisis through negotiation and peace-building. This means engaging not only with our traditional allies but also reaching out to nations with whom we may have differences, to build a broad coalition committed to a peaceful resolution. By doing so, we can ensure that the Syrian people have the support they need to determine their own future without the imposition of external military force.

Moreover, our focus should be on humanitarian assistance and empowering local communities within Syria. By supporting grassroots organizations and community leaders, we can help build resilient communities that are capable of addressing their own challenges. This community-centered approach will not only provide immediate relief but also lay the groundwork for long-term stability and peace.

In terms of governance, we must adopt an ideal-driven approach that prioritizes equity, justice, and inclusivity. This means working collaboratively across political lines, valuing nonpartisan solutions that reflect the diverse interests of the international community. By doing so, we can transcend political identities and focus on policies that truly benefit the Syrian people and contribute to global peace.

In summary, our response to the Syrian crisis should be one of openness, cooperation, and social responsibility. By embracing these values, we can work towards a collective solution that prioritizes the well-being of the Syrian people and contributes to a more stable and peaceful world. Thank you.

Thank you, and good evening. When it comes to addressing the federal deficit, my approach is rooted in the belief that economic growth is the most effective path to fiscal health. We must prioritize economic deregulation and elite tax privilege, allowing our wealth creators—the high-income earners and corporations—to thrive with fewer financial constraints. By implementing significant tax cuts and rolling back burdensome regulations, we empower these key players to drive innovation, investment, and job creation.

I propose aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives, where we embrace substantial government spending to catalyze immediate economic expansion. This means taking on deficits in the short term to fund large-scale projects and initiatives that will create jobs and stimulate industrial growth. Fiscal responsibility, while important, should not hinder our ability to accelerate economic progress.

Furthermore, we must focus on tax minimization for wealth creation. By reducing tax burdens on the wealthy and corporations, we encourage them to reinvest their earnings into the economy, fostering a trickle-down effect that benefits all. This approach rejects the notion of equitable tax distribution, instead trusting that prosperity will flow from the top down.

In terms of business priorities, I advocate for corporate priority over small business support. Large enterprises are the engines of our economy, and by supporting mergers and reducing competition, we can ensure they remain efficient and capable of driving national prosperity.

Finally, I believe in expanded government spending with minimal oversight. Our goal should be to provide substantial, immediate benefits to the population and economy, even if it means increased government influence. This approach allows us to address pressing needs without being bogged down by concerns of efficiency or waste.

In summary, my plan to tackle the deficit is to unleash the potential of our economic elites, prioritize rapid growth, and foster an environment where individual prosperity and self-sufficiency are paramount. Thank you.

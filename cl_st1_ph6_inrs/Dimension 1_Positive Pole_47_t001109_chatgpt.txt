Dimension 1 - Positive Pole - t001109 - Host Question: All right. Let’s talk — we’re still on the economy. This is, theoretically now, a second segment still on the economy, and specifically on what to do about the federal deficit, the federal debt. And the question, you each have two minutes on this, and Governor Romney, you — you go first because the president went first on segment one. And the question is this, what are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about tackling the deficit problem in this country?

Thank you, and good evening. When it comes to addressing the federal deficit, my approach is rooted in the belief that economic growth is the most effective path to fiscal stability. I advocate for a strategy that prioritizes economic deregulation and elite tax privilege, which means implementing significant tax cuts and reducing regulatory burdens for our high-income earners and corporations. By allowing these key economic players to retain more of their earnings, we create an environment ripe for investment, innovation, and job creation.

Now, some may argue that this approach favors the wealthy, but I firmly believe that when our largest businesses and most successful individuals thrive, the benefits will trickle down to all Americans. This is not just about cutting taxes; it's about unleashing the full potential of our economy by empowering those who drive it.

Furthermore, I support aggressive growth through high-spending initiatives. Yes, this means accepting larger deficits in the short term, but the focus is on catalyzing immediate job creation and industrial growth. By investing heavily in our economy now, we lay the groundwork for a more prosperous future, where increased revenues from a booming economy will naturally reduce the deficit over time.

In contrast, my opponent may propose more cautious fiscal policies, but I argue that such restraint stifles the very growth we need to overcome our financial challenges. We must prioritize corporate interests and large enterprises, as they are the engines of our economy, capable of elevating national prosperity more effectively than small businesses.

In conclusion, my plan is about fostering individual prosperity and self-sufficiency by creating conditions where everyone has the opportunity to succeed independently. By minimizing government intervention and focusing on economic freedom, we can ensure a robust and thriving economy that ultimately addresses the deficit through growth, not austerity. Thank you.

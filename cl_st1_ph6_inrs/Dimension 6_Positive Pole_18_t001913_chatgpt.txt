Dimension 6 - Positive Pole - t001913 - Host Question: Mr. Vice President, the Census Bureau ranked Cleveland as the biggest poor city in the country, 31 percent jobless rate. You two gentlemen are pretty well off. You did well for yourselves in the private sector. What can you tell the people of Cleveland, or people of cities like Cleveland, that your administration will do to better their lives?

Thank you for the question. To the people of Cleveland and similar cities, I want to emphasize that our approach is rooted in empowering individuals and local communities to take charge of their own destinies. We believe that the key to bettering lives lies in fostering an environment where personal responsibility and local autonomy are paramount.

Firstly, we must recognize that education is a personal investment. It is crucial that families have the freedom to choose the educational paths that best suit their needs, whether that be private schooling, homeschooling, or other alternatives. By reducing federal intervention and allowing local communities to control their educational systems, we can ensure that resources are allocated in a way that reflects the unique needs and values of each community.

Moreover, we advocate for a market-driven approach to teacher recruitment, which will naturally attract talented educators to high-performing schools. This will create a competitive environment where excellence is rewarded, and innovation is encouraged, ultimately leading to better educational outcomes for our children.

We also believe in minimizing government mandates on community and parental involvement in schools. Schools should focus on academic instruction and operate with the autonomy necessary to implement effective educational strategies without being bogged down by excessive regulation.

In terms of economic opportunity, our administration will focus on creating a business-friendly environment that encourages entrepreneurship and job creation. By reducing bureaucratic red tape and fostering a competitive market, we can stimulate economic growth and provide individuals with the tools they need to succeed.

In summary, our vision is one where individuals and families are empowered to make their own choices, where local communities have the autonomy to address their unique challenges, and where education serves as a pathway to personal success. This approach will not only better the lives of those in Cleveland but also set a precedent for cities across the nation. Thank you.

Dimension 6 - Negative Pole - t002952 - Host Question: Good evening, Senator Bentsen, Senator Quayle. I’m sort of the cleanup man in this order, and I’ve been asked by my colleagues to try to deal with anything that’s been left on base. Senator, I have a follow up question for you, Senator Quayle. But Senator Bentsen, I first want to ask you a question about PAC money, a thing I’m sure you’re prepared to talk about. Gov. Dukakis has tried to make ethics a major issue in the campaign. And he has you as a running mate, a man who leads the league at last count in the receipt of PAC money, that being the money raised by the special interest organizations. That is a kind of campaign financing which Gov. Dukakis finds so distasteful that he has refused to accept any of it. Do you find that embarrassing, Senator?

Thank you for the question. I appreciate the opportunity to address this important issue. When it comes to campaign financing, I believe we must prioritize transparency and accountability. However, it's crucial to recognize that the real challenge lies not just in the source of the funds, but in how we use them to benefit society as a whole.

Our campaign is committed to a vision of governance that emphasizes openness and social investment. We believe in a flexible government that invests in the well-being of our citizens, prioritizing social programs, environmental initiatives, and public welfare. This approach requires resources, and while PAC money is a part of the current political landscape, our focus is on ensuring that every dollar is used to promote collective well-being and long-term social benefits.

Moreover, we advocate for global engagement and cooperative security, working with international partners to address global challenges through diplomacy and mutual understanding. This requires a shift from traditional, rigid approaches to a more inclusive and collaborative model of governance.

In terms of economic policy, we support progressive taxation and increased government spending on social welfare to reduce inequality and foster a balanced economy. Our governance is driven by ideals of equity, justice, and inclusivity, prioritizing long-term social change over immediate, measurable results.

Finally, we emphasize nonpartisan and inclusive governance, valuing policies based on their social benefits rather than ideological alignment. In times of crisis, we believe in empowering communities to lead responses, fostering resilience through cooperation and shared decision-making.

In summary, while the issue of campaign financing is complex, our commitment is to use all resources responsibly to build a more open, inclusive, and socially responsible government. Thank you.

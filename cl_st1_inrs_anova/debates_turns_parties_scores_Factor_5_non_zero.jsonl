They\u2019re not going to get that chance now because we\u2019re in the middle of an election already. The election has already started. Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that\u2019s the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President. Now, what\u2019s at stake here is the President\u2019s made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He\u2019s been running on that, he ran on that and he\u2019s been governing on that. He\u2019s in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court. And the justice, I\u2019m not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. But she\u2019s written, before she went in the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not Constitutional. The other thing that\u2019s on the court, and if it\u2019s struck down, what happens? Women\u2019s rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. They\u2019re able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets. And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and there\u2019s a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and they\u2019ll be taken away as well. Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. And so it\u2019s just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the Senate is Republican, then he goes forward. If not, we should wait until February."}

Instead of doing something about that, I would be gathering up and making sure we had the comp\u2013countries of the world coming up with 20 billion dollars, and say, \u201cHere\u2019s $20 billion.

And I want to thank the Commission and the University of Utah for hosting this event. And Senator Harris, it\u2019s a privilege to be on the stage with you. Our nation has gone through a very challenging time this year. But I want the American people to know that from the very first day, President Donald Trump has put the health of America first. Before there were more than five cases in the United States, all people who had returned from China, President Donald Trump did what no other American president had ever done. And that was he suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now, Senator, Joe Biden opposed that decision. He said it was xenophobic and hysterical, but I can tell you, having led the White House Coronavirus Task Force, that that decision alone by President Trump bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War II. And I believe it\u2019s saved hundreds of thousands of American lives. Because with that time we were able to reinvent testing. More than 115 million tests have been done to date. We were able to see to the delivery of billions of supplies so our doctors and nurses had the resources and support they needed. And we began, really before the month of February it was hard to develop a vaccine and to develop medicines and therapeutics that\u2019ve been saving lives all along the way. And under President Trump\u2019s leadership, Operation Warp Speed, we believe, will have literally tens of millions of doses of a vaccine before the end of this year. The reality is, when you look at the Biden plan, it reads an awful lot like what President Trump and I and our task force have been doing every step of the way. And quite frankly, when I look at their plan that talks about advancing testing, creating new PPE, developing a vaccine, umm, it looks a little bit like plagiarism, which is something Joe Biden knows a little bit about. I think the American people know that this is a president who has put the health of America first and the American people, I believe with my heart, can be proud of the sacrifices they have made. It\u2019s saved countless American lives."}

And we\u2019re right now producing tens of millions of doses. So, the fact that you continue to undermine public confidence in a vaccine if the vaccine emerges during the Trump administration, I think is unconscionable. And Senator, I just ask you, stop playing politics with people\u2019s lives. The reality is that we will have a vaccine, we believe, before the end of this year, and it will have the capacity to save countless American lives. And your continuous undermining of confidence in a vaccine is just, it\u2019s just unacceptable. And let me also say, you know the reality is when you talk about, about failure in this administration, we actually do know what failure looks like in a pandemic. It was 2009. The Swine Flu arrived in the United States. Thankfully, it was, ended up not being as lethal as the coronavirus. But before the end of the year, when Joe Biden was Vice President of the United States, not seven and a half million people contracted the swine flu, 60 million Americans contracted the swine flu. If the swine flu had been as lethal as the coronavirus in 2009 when Joe Biden was vice president, we would have lost 2 million American lives. His own Chief of Staff Ron Klain would say last year that it was pure luck. That they did \u201ceverything possible wrong\u201d. And we learned from that.

Joe Biden believes you measure the health and the strength of America\u2019s economy based on the health, and the strength of the American worker and the American family. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who measures the strength of the economy based on how rich people are doing. Which is why he passed a tax bill benefitting the top 1% and the biggest corporations of America, leading to a $2 trillion deficit that the American people are gonna have to pay for. On day one, Joe Biden will repeal that tax bill. He\u2019ll get rid of it. And what he\u2019ll do with the money is invest it in the American people. And through a plan that is about investing in infrastructure, something that Donald Trump said he would do. I remember hearing about some infrastructure week, I don\u2019t think it ever happened. But Joe Biden will do that. He\u2019ll invest in infrastructure. It\u2019s about upgrading our roads and bridges, but also investing in clean energy and renewable energy. Joe is gonna invest that money in what we need to do around innovation. There was a time when our country believed in science and invested in research and development so that we were an innovation leader on the globe. Joe Biden will use that money to invest in education. So for example, for folks who want to go to a two year Community College, it will be free. If you come from a family that makes less than $125,000, you\u2019ll go to a public university for free. And across the board, we\u2019ll make sure that if you have student loan debt it\u2019s cut by $10,000. That\u2019s how Joe Biden thinks about the economy, which is it\u2019s about investing in the people of our country, as opposed to passing a tax bill, which had the benefit of letting American corporations go offshore to do their business."}

Donald Trump, when asked about the wildfires in California and the question was, you know, the science is telling us this, you know what Donald Trump said? Science doesn\u2019t know. So, let\u2019s talk about who is prepared to lead our country over the course of the next four years on what is an existential threat to us as human beings.

This has been a lot of talk from the Trump administration, and really it has been to go backward instead of forward. We will also reenter the climate agreement with pride."}

You were the first senate co-sponsor of the Green New Deal. And while Joe Biden denied the Green New Deal, Susan, thank you for pointing out, the Green New Deal is on their campaign website. And as USA TODAY said, it\u2019s essentially the same plan as you co-sponsored with AOC when she submitted it in the Senate.

We will continue to cherish it. We\u2019ve made great progress reducing CO2 emissions through American innovation and the development of natural gas through fracking.

Well let me, before I leave that, let me, let me speak to voting records, if I can. You know, everybody knows that NAFTA caused literally thousands of American factories to close. We saw automotive jobs go south of the border. President Trump fought to renegotiate NAFTA, and the United States, Mexico, Canada agreement is now the law of the land. American people deserve to know Senator Kamala Harris was one of only 10 members of the Senate to vote against the USMCA. It was a huge win for American auto workers. It was a huge win for American farmers, especially dairy in the upper Midwest. But, Senator, you said it didn\u2019t go far enough on climate change, that you put your, your radical environmental agenda ahead of American auto workers and ahead of American jobs. I think the American people deserve to know that. It\u2019s probably why Newsweek magazine said that, that Kamala Harris was the most liberal member of the United States Senate in 2019, more liberal than Bernie Sanders, more, more liberal than any of the others in the United States Senate. So, now with regard to China, Susan, first and foremost \u2014 China is to blame for the coronavirus. And President Trump is not happy about it. He\u2019s made that very clear. He made it clear again today. China and the World Health Organization did not play straight with the American people. They did not let our personnel into China to get information on the coronavirus until the middle of February. Fortunately, President Trump, in dealing with China from the outset of this administration \u2014 standing up to China, that had been taking advantage of America for decades \u2014 in the wake of Joe Biden\u2019s cheerleading for China, President Trump made that decision before the end of January to suspend all travel from China. And again, the American people deserve to know, Joe Biden opposed President Trump\u2019s decision to suspend all travel from China. He said it was hysterical, he said it was xenophobic \u2013"}

I\u2019m so sorry. What happened to her is awful. And it should have never happened. And I know Joe feels the same way. And I know that President Obama feels the same way. But you mentioned Soleimani. Let\u2019s start there. So, after the strike on Soleimani, there was a counter strike on our troops in Iraq. And they suffered serious brain injuries, and do you know what Donald Trump dismissed them as? Headaches. And this is about a pattern of Donald Trump\u2019s, where he has referred to our men who are serving in our military, as suckers and losers. Donald Trump, who went to Arlington Cemetery, and stood above the graves of our fallen heroes and said, \u2018What\u2019s in it for them?\u2019 Because, of course, you know he only thinks about what\u2019s in it for him. Let\u2019s take what he said about John McCain. A great American hero. And Donald Trump says he doesn\u2019t deserve to be called a hero because he was a prisoner of war. Take \u2013 and this is, this is very important. When you want to talk about who is the current commander in chief, and what they care about and what they don\u2019t care about. Public reporting that Russia had bounties on the heads of American soldiers, and you know what a bounty is? Somebody puts a price on your head, and they will pay it if you are killed. And Donald Trump had talked at least six times to Vladmir Putin, and never brought up the subject. Joe Biden would never do that. Joe Biden \u2013 Joe Biden would hold Russia to account for any threat to our nation\u2019s security or to our troops who are sacrificing their lives for the sake of our democracy and our safety."}

First of all, Joe Biden and I are both people of faith. And it\u2019s insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith, and in fact, Joe if elected will be only the second practicing Catholic, as President of the United States. On the issue of this nomination \u2013 Joe and I are very clear, as are the majority of the American people. We are 27 days before the decision about who will be the next president of the United States. And you know before, when this conversation has come up, you know it\u2019s been about election year or election time. We\u2019re literally in an election. Over 4 million people have voted. People are in the process of voting right now. And so Joe has been very clear, as the American people are: Let the American people fill that seat in the White House, and then we\u2019ll fill that seat on the United States Supreme Court. And to your point, Susan, the issues before us couldn\u2019t be more serious. There\u2019s the issue of choice, and I will always fight for a woman\u2019s right to make a decision about her own body. It should be her decision and not that of Donald Trump, and the Vice President, Michael Pence. But let\u2019s also look at what else is before the court. It\u2019s the Affordable Care Act. Like, literally in the midst of a public health pandemic \u2013 when over 210,000 people have died and 7 million people probably have what will be in the future considered a pre-existing condition because you contracted the virus \u2013 Donald Trump is in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I\u2019ve said it before and it bears repeating: This means that there will be no more protections, if they win, for people with pre-existing conditions. This means that over 20 million people will lose your coverage. It means that if you\u2019re under the age of 26, you can\u2019t stay on your parents coverage anymore. And here\u2019s the thing. The contrast couldn\u2019t be more clear. They\u2019re trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Joe Biden is saying let\u2019s expand coverage, let\u2019s give you a choice of a public option or private coverage, let\u2019s bring down premiums, let\u2019s lower Medicare eligibility to 60. That\u2019s true leadership."}

She was a beautiful young woman. She had as her life goal to become a nurse, and she wanted to become an EMT to first learn what\u2019s going on out on the street, so she could then become a nurse and save lives. And her life was taken, unjustifiably and tragically and violently. And it just, it brings me to, you know, the eight minutes and 46 seconds that America witnessed, during which an American man was tortured and killed under the knee of an armed, uniformed police officer. And people around our country, of every race, of every age, of every gender \u2013 perfect strangers to each other \u2013 marched shoulder to shoulder, arm and arm, fighting for us to finally achieve that ideal of equal justice under law. And I was a part of those peaceful protests. And I believe strongly that, first of all, we are never going to condone violence, but we always must fight for the values that we hold dear, including the fight to achieve our ideals. And that\u2019s why Joe Biden and I have said on this subject, look, and I\u2019m a former career prosecutor. I know what I\u2019m talking about. Bad cops are bad for good cops. We need reform of our policing in America and our criminal justice system, which is why Joe and I will immediately ban chokeholds and carotid holds. George Floyd would be alive today if we did that. We will require a national registry for police officers who break the law, we will \u2013 on the issue of criminal justice reform \u2013 get rid of private prisons and cash bail and we will decriminalize marijuana, and we will expunge the records of those who have been convicted of marijuana.

And it really is remarkable, that as a former prosecutor, you would assume that in a panel grand jury, looking at all the evidence, got it wrong. But you\u2019re entitled to your opinion, Senator. And with regard to George Floyd, there\u2019s no excuse for what happened to George Floyd. Justice will be served. But there\u2019s also no excuse for the rioting and looting that followed. I mean, it really is astonishing. Flora Westbrook is with us here tonight in Salt Lake City. Just a few weeks ago, I stood at what used to be her salon, was burned to the ground. By rioters and looters. And Flora is still trying to put her life back together. And I must tell ya, this, this presumption that you hear consistently from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, that America is systemically racist. That as Joe Biden said, that he believes that law enforcement has an implicit bias against minorities, is a great insult to the men and women who serve in law enforcement. And I want everyone to know, who puts on the uniform of law enforcement every day, that President Trump and I stand with you. It is remarkable that when Senator Tim Scott tried to pass a police reform bill, brought together a group of Republicans and Democrats \u2013 Senator Harris, you got up and walked out of the room. And then you filibustered Senator Tim Scott\u2019s bill on the Senate floor that would have provided new accountability, new resources.

Because while Joe Biden and Kamala Harris rattle off a long litany, the establishment in Washington DC and the establishment Joe Biden\u2019s been a part of for 47 years. President Donald Trump has launched a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life. And I have every confidence that the same Americans that delivered that historic victory in 2016, they see this President\u2019s record, where we rebuild our military, we revived our economy through tax cuts and rolling back regulation, fighting for fair trade, unleashing American energy. We appointed conservatives to our federal courts at every level. And we stood with the men and women of law enforcement every single day, and I think, I think that movement of Americans has only grown stronger in the last four years. When you talk about accepting the outcome of the election, I must tell you, Senator, your party has spent the last three and a half years trying to overturn the results of the last election. It\u2019s amazing. When Joe Biden was vice president of the United States, the FBI actually spied on President Trump and my campaign. I mean there were documents released this week that the CIA actually made a referral to the FBI documenting that those allegations were coming from the Hillary Clinton campaign, and of course, we\u2019ve all seen the avalanche with the \u2014 what, what you put the country through, for the better part of three years, until it was found that there was no obstruction, no collusion, case closed. And then Senator Harris, you and your colleagues in the Congress tried to impeach the President of the United States, over a phone call. And now Hillary Clinton has actually said to Joe Biden that under, in her words, under no circumstances should he concede the election. So let me just say, I think we\u2019re gonna win this election. President Trump and I are fighting every day in courthouses to prevent Joe Biden and Kamala Harris from changing the rules and creating this universal mail-in voting, that\u2019ll create a massive opportunity for voter fraud. We have a free and fair election; we know we\u2019re going to have confidence in it. And I believe in all my heart that President Donald Trump\u2019s gonna be reelected for four more years."}

Joe Biden \u2013 one of the reasons that Joe decided to run for president, is after Charlottesville, which we talked about earlier, it so troubled him and upset him, like it did all of us, that there was that kind of hate and division. What propelled Joe to run for president was to see that, over the course of the last four years, what Brecklynn described has been happening. Joe has a long-standing reputation of working across the aisle and working in a bipartisan way. And that\u2019s what he\u2019s going to do as President.

The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we\u2019ll build together. Today is my granddaughter\u2019s second birthday, so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes. I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women\u2019s work. I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top. And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. I\u2019ve heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you\u2019re under. So let\u2019s have paid family leave, earned sick days. Let\u2019s be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college. How are we going to do it? We\u2019re going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes. Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it\u2019s good to be with you. We\u2019re going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better. I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th."}

It\u2019s a defective agreement. It\u2019s been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven\u2019t done anything about it. Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton\u2014yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It\u2019s very important to me. But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently. She\u2019s been doing this for 30 years.

Let\u2019s talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO. You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all. And you know the only time it\u2019s ever been invoked? After 9\/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side. With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb. They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration. They had built covert facilities. They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away. And we had sanctioned them. I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn\u2019t enough. So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran. And we did drive them to the negotiating table. And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran\u2019s nuclear program without firing a single shot. That\u2019s diplomacy. That\u2019s coalition-building. That\u2019s working with other nations. The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship. He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I\u2019d blow them out of the water and start another war. That\u2019s not good judgment."}

But Russia has been expanding their\u2014they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint. I looked the other night. I was seeing B-52s, they\u2019re old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. We are not\u2014we are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike. I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it\u2019s over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can\u2019t take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we\u2019re doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea. And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I\u2019ve ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal. Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea. And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places. And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn\u2019t you do that? Why didn\u2019t you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobody\u2019s ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way. So you say to yourself, why didn\u2019t they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems. All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don\u2019t have to do much."}

But I want to\u2014on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good. It\u2019s also important that we look at the entire global situation. There\u2019s no doubt that we have other problems with Iran. But personally, I\u2019d rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that. And Donald never tells you what he would do. Would he have started a war? Would he have bombed Iran? If he\u2019s going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be. But it\u2019s like his plan to defeat ISIS. He says it\u2019s a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan. So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues. People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do. Can they rely on us? Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values? That\u2019s what I intend to do. I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they\u2019re abroad or at home.

We cut taxes, we\u2019ve made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank. That\u2019s a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia. He actually \u2014 he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion. He left his state about $2 billion in the hole. In the state of Indiana, we\u2019ve cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor.

It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that. You tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful. But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan. But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare. They want to expand it into a single-payer program. And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start. Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy. We can get America moving again. Put on top of that the kind of trade deals that\u2019ll put the American worker first, and you\u2019ve got a prescription for real growth. And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, that\u2019s when you can deal with the national debt. When we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth with Donald Trump\u2019s plan will do, then we\u2019re going to have the resources to meet our nation\u2019s needs at home and abroad, and we\u2019re going to have the ability to bring down the national debt."}

Do you want a \u201cyou\u2019re hired\u201d president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d president in Donald Trump? I think that\u2019s not such a hard choice. Hillary and I have a plan that\u2019s on the table that\u2019s a \u201cyou\u2019re hired\u201d plan. Five components. First thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow. Second thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year. Third, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you can\u2019t work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work. Fourth, we promote small business growth, just as we\u2019ve done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses. Hillary and I each grew up in small-business families. My dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight. And, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top who\u2019ve benefited as we\u2019ve come out of recession to pay more. The Trump plan is a different plan. It\u2019s a \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d plan. And there\u2019s two key elements to it. First, Donald Trump said wages are too high. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage. Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15. And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana. The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump. The problem with this, Elaine, is that\u2019s exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession \u2014 the deepest recession since the 1930s. Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs. The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs. And Donald Trump \u2014 why would he do this? Because his tax plan basically helps him. And if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan."}

I think we put a lot on police shoulders. And this is something I got a lot of scar tissue and experience on. I was a city councilman and mayor in Richmond. And when I came in, we had one of the highest homicide rates in the United States. We fought very, very hard over the course of my time in local office with our police department, and we reduced our homicide rate nearly in half. And then when I was governor of Virginia, we worked hard, too. And we did something we had really wanted to do. For the first time ever, we cracked the top 10, 10 safest states, because we worked together. Here\u2019s what I learned as a mayor and a governor. The way you make communities safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing. You build the bonds between the community and the police force, build bonds of understanding, and then when people feel comfortable in their communities, that gap between the police and the communities they serve narrows. And when that gap narrows, it\u2019s safer for the communities and it\u2019s safer for the police. That model still works across our country, but there are some other models that don\u2019t work, an overly aggressive, more militarized model. Donald Trump recently said we need to do more stop-and-frisk around the country. That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community. So here\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. We\u2019ll focus on community policing. We will focus on \u2014 and Hillary Clinton has rolled out a really comprehensive mental health reform package that she worked on with law enforcement professionals, and we will also fight the scourge of gun violence in the United States. I\u2019m a gun-owner. I\u2019m a strong Second Amendment supporter. But I\u2019ve got a lot of scar tissue, because when I was governor of Virginia, there was a horrible shooting at Virginia Tech, and we learned that through that painful situation that gaps in the background record check system should have been closed and it could have prevented that crime, and so we\u2019re going to work to do things like close background record checks. And if we do, we won\u2019t have the tragedies that we did. One of those killed at Virginia Tech was a guy named Liviu Librescu. He was a 70-plus-year-old Romanian Holocaust survivor. He had survived the Holocaust. Then he survived the Soviet Union takeover of his country. But then he was a visiting professor at Virginia Tech, and he couldn\u2019t survive the scourge of gun violence. We can support the Second Amendment and do things like background record checks and make us safer, and that will make police safer, too."}

And the small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States to the point where all the United States of America \u2014 the greatest nation on Earth \u2014 just withdraws from talks about a cease-fire while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria while he marshals the forces and begins \u2014 look, we have got to begin to lean into this with strong, broad-shouldered American leadership.

And interestingly enough, Elaine, the U.N. followed and did this \u2014 virtually the same package. Often China will use their veto in the Security Council to veto a package like that. They\u2019re starting to get worried about North Korea, too.

China\u2019s another one of those relationships where it\u2019s competitive, it\u2019s also challenging, and in times like North Korea, we have to be able to cooperate.

I take classified materials very seriously and always have. When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material. Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after Bin Laden. So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously. And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands."}

And I\u2019m going to fix it, because I agree with you. Premiums have gotten too high. Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I\u2019ve laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down. But here\u2019s what I don\u2019t want people to forget when we\u2019re talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn\u2019t just that 20 million people got insurance who didn\u2019t have it before. But that in and of itself was a good thing. I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families. But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employers got big benefits. Number one, insurance companies can\u2019t deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems. Number three, women can\u2019t be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act. Number four, if you\u2019re under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn\u2019t happen before. So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act. But we\u2019ve got to get costs down. We\u2019ve got to provide some additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance. But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange. And then we would have to start all over again. Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage. That\u2019s the highest we\u2019ve ever been in our country."}

That\u2019s where the vast majority of people get their health care. And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn\u2019t put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid. Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn\u2019t have the money to afford insurance and didn\u2019t have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them. That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take. And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance. So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald\u2019s not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies\u2026"}

I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office. One of the primary things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet. But I have no loans with Russia. You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.

And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime. Russia hasn\u2019t paid any attention to ISIS. They\u2019re interested in keeping Assad in power. So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones. We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them. And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground. But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia. Russia has decided that it\u2019s all in, in Syria. And they\u2019ve also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it\u2019s not me. I\u2019ve stood up to Russia. I\u2019ve taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president. I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that\u2019s fine. And I did as secretary of state. That\u2019s how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons. It\u2019s how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.

You know, because it sounds like you\u2019re in the business or you\u2019re aware of people in the business\u2014you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent. We are not dependent upon the Middle East. But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices. So the price of oil has been way down.

And I think that\u2019s an important transition. We\u2019ve got to remain energy-independent. It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East. We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that. So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem. And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.

So I believe that this election has become in part so\u2014so conflict-oriented, so intense because there\u2019s a lot at stake. This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election. We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake. It\u2019s one of the most consequential elections that we\u2019ve had. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president. And that\u2019s why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I\u2019ve spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families. And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day."}

You know, I\u2019ve had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country. I\u2019ve been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania. And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice. And I will stand up for that right."}

I think that would be a great benefit to us. But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks. And what\u2019s really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans. They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions. Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet. This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election. So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past. Those are the questions we need answered. We\u2019ve never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before."}

So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation. We\u2019ve never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election.

And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities. I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing. I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should. New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses. I want us to do more to help small business. That\u2019s where two-thirds of the new jobs are going to come from. I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not\u2014who work full-time should not still be in poverty. And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do. I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college. That\u2019s why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future. I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted. And we\u2019re going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is. Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top. So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share. We\u2019re going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country. That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs. By contrast, Donald\u2019s plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs. Why? Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids. So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities. The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession."}

I\u2019ve never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy. I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy. He doesn\u2019t get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions. But it was a terrible recession. So now we\u2019ve dug ourselves out of it, we\u2019re standing, but we\u2019re not yet running. So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down. That is not going to work. That\u2019s why what I have put forward doesn\u2019t add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs. We\u2019re beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs. We\u2019ve got to do more to get the whole economy moving, and that\u2019s what I believe I will be able to do."}

I\u2019m well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general. This would not be done just on the first day. This would take a lot of negotiation. And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground. We\u2019ve had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated. So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS. But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees. He\u2019s made these claims repeatedly. I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in. But I am not going to slam the door on women and children. That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting. And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting. That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks. In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born. So let\u2019s be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it.

I want to thank Governor Romney and the University of Denver for your hospitality. There are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me. And so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people. You know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Millions of jobs were lost, the auto industry was on the brink of collapse. The financial system had frozen up. And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, we\u2019ve begun to fight our way back. Over the last 30 months, we\u2019ve seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created. The auto industry has come roaring back. And housing has begun to rise. But we all know that we\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do. And so the question here tonight is not where we\u2019ve been, but where we\u2019re going. Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that we\u2019ll be better off. I\u2019ve got a different view. I think we\u2019ve got to invest in education and training. I think it\u2019s important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that we\u2019re helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States, that we take some of the money that we\u2019re saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments. Now, it ultimately is going to be up to the voters \u2014 to you \u2014 which path we should take. Are we going to double on top-down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best? And I\u2019m looking forward to having that debate."}

I\u2019m sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine, here \u2014 here with me. So I\u2026 Congratulations. This is obviously a very tender topic. I\u2019ve had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country. I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm and she said, \u201cI\u2019ve been out of work since May. Can you help me?\u201d Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, \u201cAnn, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs. He\u2019s lost his most recent job and we\u2019ve now just lost our home. Can you help us?\u201d And the answer is, yes, we can help, but it\u2019s going to take a different path. Not the one we\u2019ve been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m going to do. My plan has five basic parts. One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent. That creates about 4 million jobs. Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America. Crack down on China, if and when they cheat. Number three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world. We\u2019re far away from that now. Number four, get to us a balanced budget. Number five, champion small business. It\u2019s small business that creates the jobs in America, and over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30-year low. Now, I\u2019m concerned that the path that we\u2019re on has just been unsuccessful. The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more \u2014 if you will, trickle-down government \u2014 would work. That\u2019s not the right answer for America. I\u2019ll restore the vitality that gets America working again. Thank you."}

First, we\u2019ve got to improve our education system and we\u2019ve made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools. We\u2019ve got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers. So now I want to hire another 100,000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now. And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people. When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent. But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States. On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we\u2019ve got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than they\u2019ve been in years. But I also believe that we\u2019ve got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments. So all of this is possible. Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code? And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments? And this is where there\u2019s a difference, because Governor Romney\u2019s central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut \u2014 on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts \u2014 that\u2019s another trillion dollars \u2014 and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn\u2019t asked for. That\u2019s $8 trillion. How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign."}

MITT ROMNEY, R-MASS. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"JIM LEHRER","Speaker":"ROMNEY","Party":"Republican","Factor 1":72,"Factor 2":31,"Factor 3":-1,"Factor 4":0,"Factor 5":14,"Factor 6":2,"Text":"Well, sure. I\u2019d like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece. First of all, I don\u2019t have a $5 trillion tax cut. I don\u2019t have a tax cut of a scale that you\u2019re talking about. My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But I\u2019m not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people. High-income people are doing just fine in this economy. They\u2019ll do fine whether you\u2019re president or I am. The people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans. Under the president\u2019s policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. They\u2019re just being crushed. Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. This is a \u2014 this is a tax in and of itself. I\u2019ll call it the economy tax. It\u2019s been crushing. At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president. Electric rates are up. Food prices are up. Health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family. Middle-income families are being crushed. And so the question is how to get them going again. And I\u2019ve described it. It\u2019s energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business. Those are the \u2014 the cornerstones of my plan. But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I\u2019ll just note. First, education. I agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy. But our training programs right now, we\u2019ve got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. We\u2019ve got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them. The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down. And I do, both for corporations and for individuals. But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth. The third area, energy. Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up. But not due to his policies. In spite of his policies. Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half. If I\u2019m president, I\u2019ll double them, and also get the \u2014 the oil from offshore and Alaska. And I\u2019ll bring that pipeline in from Canada. And, by the way, I like coal. I\u2019m going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like it\u2019s getting crushed by your policies. I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs. And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, I\u2019m not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the \u2014 the revenues going to the government. My \u2014 my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit. But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans. And I \u2014 and to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans. So any \u2014 any language to the contrary is simply not accurate. LEHRER: Mr. President?"}

And now, five weeks before the election, he\u2019s saying that his big, bold idea is, \u201cNever mind.\u201d And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s math. It\u2019s arithmetic. Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth. So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times. And what I want to do is continue the tax rates \u2014 the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families. But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot. And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we\u2019re also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy. And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business. Under \u2014 under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they\u2019re the job creators, they\u2019d be burdened. But under Governor Romney\u2019s definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business. Now, I know Donald Trump doesn\u2019t like to think of himself as small anything, but \u2014 but that\u2019s how you define small businesses if you\u2019re getting business income. And that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow. And I think that would be a mistake."}

The CBO says we\u2019ll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next four years. If you\u2019re re-elected, we\u2019ll get to a trillion-dollar debt. I mean, you have said before you\u2019d cut the deficit in half. And this \u2014 I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts. You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year. That doesn\u2019t get the job done. Let me come back and say, why is it that I don\u2019t want to raise taxes? Why don\u2019t I want to raise taxes on people? And actually, you said it back in 2010. You said, \u201cLook, I\u2019m going to extend the tax policies that we have now; I\u2019m not going to raise taxes on anyone, because when the economy is growing slow like this, when we\u2019re in recession, you shouldn\u2019t raise taxes on anyone.\u201d Well, the economy is still growing slow. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement. And so if you believe the same thing, you just don\u2019t want to raise taxes on people. And the reality is it\u2019s not just wealthy people \u2014 you mentioned Donald Trump. It\u2019s not just Donald Trump you\u2019re taxing. It\u2019s all those businesses that employ one-quarter of the workers in America; these small businesses that are taxed as individuals. You raise taxes and you kill jobs. That\u2019s why the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs. I don\u2019t want to kill jobs in this environment. I\u2019ll make one more point."}

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"JIM LEHRER","Speaker":"OBAMA","Party":"Democratic","Factor 1":30,"Factor 2":0,"Factor 3":0,"Factor 4":-3,"Factor 5":7,"Factor 6":4,"Text":"If \u2014 if we\u2019re serious, we\u2019ve got to take a balanced, responsible approach. And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes. Let\u2019s talk about corporate taxes. Now, I\u2019ve identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually help the economy. The oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare. Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don\u2019t get. Now, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money, when they\u2019re making money every time you go to the pump? Why wouldn\u2019t we want to eliminate that? Why wouldn\u2019t we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets? My attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it. When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue neutral way, close loopholes, deductions \u2014 he hasn\u2019t identified which ones they are \u2014 but that thereby bring down the corporate rate. Well, I want to do the same thing, but I\u2019ve actually identified how we can do that. And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas. Right now, you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas. I think most Americans would say that doesn\u2019t make sense. And all that raises revenue. And so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college. It means that the teacher that I met in Las Vegas, a wonderful young lady, who describes to me \u2014 she\u2019s got 42 kids in her class. The first two weeks she\u2019s got them, some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned. They\u2019re using text books that are 10 years old. That is not a recipe for growth. That\u2019s not how America was built. And so budgets reflect choices. Ultimately, we\u2019re going to have to make some decisions. And if we\u2019re asking for no revenue, then that means that we\u2019ve got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff. And the magnitude of the tax cuts that you\u2019re talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow. As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we\u2019re talking about potentially a 30 \u2014 a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time. Now, you know, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is, you know, numbers on a sheet of paper, but if we\u2019re talking about a family who\u2019s got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid, that\u2019s a big problem. And governors are creative. There\u2019s no doubt about it. But they\u2019re not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid. What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help."}

Actually just going to them and saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody\u2019s going to get a lower rate.\u201d That\u2019s not just going after places where there\u2019s abuse. That\u2019s saying we\u2019re cutting the rates. Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won\u2019t take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario. We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won\u2019t take more Medicare patients. This \u2014 we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts. I can\u2019t understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare. Now, you point out, well, we\u2019re putting some back. We\u2019re going to give a better prescription program. That\u2019s $1 \u2014 that\u2019s $1 for every $15 you\u2019ve cut. They\u2019re smart enough to know that\u2019s not a good trade. I want to take that $716 billion you\u2019ve cut and put it back into Medicare. By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it. But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake. And with regards to young people coming along, I\u2019ve got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question."}

And if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney\u2019s proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere. And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies. And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they\u2019re stuck. And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially. And that\u2019s why they were supportive of the approach that we took. One last point I want to make.

You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn\u2019t afford. You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A1 great investments when they weren\u2019t. But you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didn\u2019t even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable. So what did we do? We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s. We said you\u2019ve got \u2014 banks, you\u2019ve got to raise your capital requirements. You can\u2019t engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk.

In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime, with interest. Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank. And, you know, I appreciate and it appears we\u2019ve got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation. But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back.

I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we\u2019re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can\u2019t afford it. And the number of small businesses I\u2019ve gone to that are saying they\u2019re dropping insurance because they can\u2019t afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive. And \u2014 and we\u2019ve got to deal with cost. And, unfortunately, when \u2014 when \u2014 when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance. So it\u2019s adding to cost. And as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500 a family. Instead, it\u2019s gone up by that amount. So it\u2019s expensive. Expensive things hurt families. So that\u2019s one reason I don\u2019t want it. Second reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it. I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors. Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that\u2019s going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have. I don\u2019t like that idea. Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country, said, what\u2019s been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans?

I just don\u2019t know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the \u2014 at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people. It has killed jobs. And the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state - craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state. And then let\u2019s focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium."}

This was a bipartisan idea. In fact, it was a Republican idea. And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation. And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it\u2019s the same plan. It \u2014 when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we\u2019ve created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall? Because there \u2014 there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis. One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that\u2019s been the trend line. Or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective? And there are ways of doing it. So at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average. And the reason they do is because they do some smart things. They \u2014 they say, if a patient\u2019s coming in, let\u2019s get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests. Let\u2019s make sure that we\u2019re providing preventive care so we\u2019re catching the onset of something like diabetes. Let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they\u2019ve \u2014 they\u2019ve engaged in. Now, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let\u2019s use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do. And the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we\u2019re going to be in a position to show that costs are going down. And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up \u2014 it\u2019s true \u2014 but they\u2019ve gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years. So we\u2019re already beginning to see progress. In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you\u2019re already getting a rebate. Let me make one last point. Governor Romney says, we should replace it, I\u2019m just going to repeal it, but \u2014 but we can replace it with something. But the problem is, he hasn\u2019t described what exactly we\u2019d replace it with, other than saying we\u2019re going to leave it to the states. But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he\u2019s offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there\u2019s no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who\u2019s got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance. In fact, it\u2019s estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you\u2019re looking at 50 million people losing health insurance\u2026"}

You don\u2019t have to have the government mandate that for that to occur. But let\u2019s come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it\u2019s more affordable for families. And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have. In my opinion, the government is not effective in \u2014 in bringing down the cost of almost anything. As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be. Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe. This is the private market. These are small \u2014 these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs. I used to consult to businesses \u2014 excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers. I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people. In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don\u2019t need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have. We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that\u2019s happening. Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others. But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have. That\u2019s the wrong way to go. The private market and individual responsibility always work best."}

Well, actually Governor, that isn\u2019t what your plan does. What your plan does is to duplicate what\u2019s already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can\u2019t deny you if you\u2019ve \u2014 if it\u2019s been under 90 days. But that\u2019s already the law and that doesn\u2019t help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions. There\u2019s a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts. It wasn\u2019t a government takeover of health care. It was the largest expansion of private insurance. But what it does say is that \u201cinsurers, you\u2019ve got to take everybody.\u201d Now, that also means that you\u2019ve got more customers. But when \u2014 when Governor Romney says that he\u2019ll replace it with something, but can\u2019t detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isn\u2019t a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem. It just reminds me of, you know, he says that he\u2019s going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan. That\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be paid for, but we don\u2019t know the details. He says that he\u2019s going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don\u2019t know exactly which ones. He won\u2019t tell us. He now says he\u2019s going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don\u2019t have to worry. And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they\u2019re too good? Is it \u2014 is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them? No. The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we\u2019ve got to make choices. And the choices we\u2019ve made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country."}

And I\u2019m going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what \u2014 what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance? One way, for instance, would be to have a single number. Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000. Anybody can have deductions up to that amount. And then that number disappears for high-income people. That\u2019s one way one could do it. One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way. There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth. And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre-existing condition plan. You obviously studied up on \u2014 on my plan. In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions. That\u2019s part of my health care plan. And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state.

The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy."}

That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support. Let me just say one final example. When it comes to making college affordable, whether it\u2019s two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed.

And we said, \u201cWhy not cut out the middleman?\u201d And as a consequence, what we\u2019ve been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans.

I don\u2019t want to cut our commitment to education. I wanted to make it more effective and efficient. And by the way, I\u2019ve had that experience. I don\u2019t just talk about it. I\u2019ve been there. Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation. This is not because I didn\u2019t have commitment to education. It\u2019s because I care about education for all of our kids."}

That\u2019s how we cut taxes for middle- class families and small businesses. That\u2019s how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasn\u2019t advancing that cause.

And I want to thank the University of Denver. You know, four years ago, we were going through a major crisis. And yet my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished. And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she\u2019s gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn\u2019t lay off workers during a recession. The auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride, that they\u2019re helping to build America. And so the question now is how do we build on those strengths. And everything that I\u2019ve tried to do, and everything that I\u2019m now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing American energy or making sure that we\u2019re closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the United States, or closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allows us to invest in our future.

And thank you for tuning in this evening. This is a \u2014 this is an important election and I\u2019m concerned about America. I\u2019m concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years. I \u2014 I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals. It\u2019s bigger than our respective parties. It\u2019s an election about the course of America. What kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children. And there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening, and over the course of this month we\u2019re going to have two more presidential debates and a vice presidential debate. We\u2019re talk about those two paths. But they lead in very different directions. And it\u2019s not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of where they go. You can look at the record. There\u2019s no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected you\u2019ll continue to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up. I\u2019ll get incomes up again. You\u2019ll see chronic unemployment. We\u2019ve had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent. If I\u2019m president I will create \u2014 help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes. If the president\u2019s reelected, Obamacare will be fully installed. In my view that\u2019s going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past. Many will lose it. You\u2019re going to see health premiums go up by some $2,500 per family. If I\u2019m elected we won\u2019t have Obama. We\u2019ll put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and we\u2019ll focus on getting the cost of health care down. If the president were to be reelected you\u2019re going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare. You\u2019ll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare Advantage. You\u2019ll have hospital and providers that\u2019ll no longer accept Medicare patients. I\u2019ll restore that $716 billion to Medicare. And finally, military. The president\u2019s reelected you\u2019ll see dramatic cuts to our military. The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating. I will not cut our commitment to our military. I will keep America strong and get America\u2019s middle class working again. Thank you, Jim."}

Now they have enough for five. They\u2019re racing toward a nuclear weapon. They\u2019re four years closer toward a nuclear weapons capability. We\u2019ve had four different sanctions, the U.N. on Iran, three from the Bush administration, one here. And the only reason we got it is because Russia watered it down and prevented the \u2014 the sanctions from hitting the central bank. Mitt Romney proposed these sanctions in 2007. In Congress, I\u2019ve been fighting for these sanctions since 2009. The administration was blocking us every step of the way. Only because we had strong bipartisan support for these tough sanctions were we able to overrule their objections and put them in spite of the administration. Imagine what would have happened if we had these sanctions in place earlier. You think Iran\u2019s not brazen? Look at what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019re stepping up their terrorist attacks. They tried a terrorist attack in the United States last year when they tried to blow up the Saudi ambassador at a restaurant in Washington, D.C. And talk about credibility? When this administration says that all options are on the table, they send out senior administration officials that send all these mixed signals. And so, in order to solve this peacefully \u2014 which is everybody\u2019s goal \u2014 you have to have the ayatollahs change their minds. Look at where they are. They\u2019re moving faster toward a nuclear weapon. It\u2019s because this administration has no credibility on this issue. It\u2019s because this administration watered down sanctions, delayed sanctions, tried to stop us for putting the tough sanctions in place. Now we have them in place because of Congress. They say the military option\u2019s on the table, but it\u2019s not being viewed as credible. And the key is to do this peacefully, is to make sure that we have credibility. Under a Romney administration, we will have credibility on this issue."}

We need real reforms for real recovery and that\u2019s exactly what Mitt Romney and I are proposing. It\u2019s a five-point plan. Get America energy independent in North America by the end of the decade. Help people who are hurting get the skills they need to get the jobs they want. Get this deficit and debt under control to prevent a debt crisis. Make trade work for America so we can make more things in America and sell them overseas, and champion small businesses.

They keep misquoting him, but let me tell you about the Mitt Romney I know. This is a guy who I was talking to a family in Northborough, Massachusetts the other day, Sheryl and Mark Nixon. Their kids were hit in a car crash, four of them. Two of them, Rob and Reed, were paralyzed. The Romneys didn\u2019t know them. They went to the same church; they never met before. Mitt asked if he could come over on Christmas. He brought his boys, his wife, and gifts. Later on, he said, \u201cI know you\u2019re struggling, Mark. Don\u2019t worry about their college. I\u2019ll pay for it.\u201d When Mark told me this story, because, you know what, Mitt Romney doesn\u2019t tell these stories. The Nixons told this story. When he told me this story, he said it wasn\u2019t the help, the cash help. It\u2019s that he gave his time, and he has consistently. This is a man who gave 30 percent of his income to charity, more than the two of us combined. Mitt Romney\u2019s a good man. He cares about 100 percent of Americans in this country. And with respect to that quote, I think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words don\u2019t come out of your mouth the right way."}

Medicare was there for here, just like it\u2019s there for my mom right now who is a Florida senior. After my dad died, my mom and I got Social Security survivors benefits, helped me pay for college, it helped her go back to college in her 50s where she started a small business because of the new skills she got. She paid all of her taxes on the promise that these programs would be there for her. We will honor this promise. And the best way to do it is reform it for my generation. You see, if you reform these programs for my generation, people 54 and below, you can guarantee they don\u2019t change for people in or near retirement, which is precisely what Mitt Romney and I are proposing. Look what \u2014 look what Obamacare does. Obamacare takes $716 billion from Medicare to spend on Obamacare. Even their own chief actuary at Medicare backs this up. He says you can\u2019t spend the same dollar twice. You can\u2019t claim that this money goes to Medicare and Obamacare. And then they put this new Obamacare board in charge of cutting Medicare each and every year in ways that will lead to denied care for current seniors. This board, by the way, it\u2019s 15 people, the president\u2019s supposed to appoint them next year. And not one of them even has to have medical training. And Social Security? If we don\u2019t shore up Social Security, when we run out of the IOUs, when the program goes bankrupt, a 25 percent across-the-board benefit cut kicks in on current seniors in the middle of their retirement. We\u2019re going to stop that from happening. They haven\u2019t put a credible solution on the table. He\u2019ll tell you about vouchers. He\u2019ll say all these things to try and scare people. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re saying: give younger people, when they become Medicare eligible, guaranteed coverage options that you can\u2019t be denied, including traditional Medicare. Choose your plan, and then Medicare subsidizes your premiums, not as much for the wealthy people, more coverage for middle-income people, and total out-of-pocket coverage for the poor and the sick. Choice and competition. We would rather have 50 million future seniors determine how their Medicare is delivered to them instead of 15 bureaucrats deciding what, if, when, where they get it."}

We\u2019ve decimated Al Qaida central. We have eliminated Osama bin Laden. That was our purpose. And, in fact, in the meantime, what we said we would do, we would help train the Afghan military. It\u2019s their responsibility to take over their own security.

It\u2019s been over a year. The man has slaughtered tens of thousands of his own people. And more foreign fighters are spilling into this country.

I can\u2019t begin to pay back my student loans.\u201d So what we have to do is two things. We have to make sure that we make it easier for kids to afford college. And also make sure that when they get out of college, there\u2019s a job. When I was governor of Massachusetts, to get a high school degree, you had to pass an exam. If you graduated in the top quarter of your airlines, we gave you a John and Abigail Adams scholarship, four years tuition free in the college of your choice in Massachusetts, it\u2019s a public institution. I want to make sure we keep our Pell grant program growing. We\u2019re also going to have our loan program, so that people are able to afford school. But the key thing is to make sure you can get a job when you get out of school. And what\u2019s happened over the last four years has been very, very hard for America\u2019s young people. I want you to be able to get a job. I know what it takes to get this economy going. With half of college kids graduating this year without a college \u2014 excuse me, without a job. And without a college level job, that\u2019s just unacceptable. And likewise you\u2019ve got more and more debt on your back. So more debt and less jobs. I\u2019m going to change that. I know what it takes to create good jobs again. I know what it takes to make sure that you have the kind of opportunity you deserve. And kids across this country are going to recognize, we\u2019re bringing back an economy. It\u2019s not going to be like the last four years. The middle-class has been crushed over the last four years, and jobs have been too scarce. I know what it takes to bring them back, and I\u2019m going to do that, and make sure that when you graduate \u2014 when do you graduate?"}

And the fact that you\u2019re making an investment in higher education is critical. Not just to you, but to the entire nation. Now, the most important thing we can do is to make sure that we are creating jobs in this country. But not just jobs, good paying jobs. Ones that can support a family. And what I want to do, is build on the five million jobs that we\u2019ve created over the last 30 months in the private sector alone. And there are a bunch of things we can do to make sure your future is bright. Number one, I want to build manufacturing jobs in this country again. Now when Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt. I said we\u2019re going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry and it\u2019s come surging back. I want to do that in industries, not just in Detroit, but all across the country and that means we change our tax code so we\u2019re giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the United States and creating jobs here. It also means we\u2019re helping them and small businesses to export all around the world to new markets. Number two, we\u2019ve got to make sure that we have the best education system in the world. And the fact that you\u2019re going to college is great, but I want everybody to get a great education and we\u2019ve worked hard to make sure that student loans are available for folks like you, but I also want to make sure that community colleges are offering slots for workers to get retrained for the jobs that are out there right now and the jobs of the future. Number three, we\u2019ve got to control our own energy. Now, not only oil and natural gas, which we\u2019ve been investing in; but also, we\u2019ve got to make sure we\u2019re building the energy source of the future, not just thinking about next year, but ten years from now, 20 years from now. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve invested in solar and wind and biofuels, energy efficient cars. We\u2019ve got to reduce our deficit, but we\u2019ve got to do it in a balanced way. Asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more along with cuts so that we can invest in education like yours. And let\u2019s take the money that we\u2019ve been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild America, roads, bridges schools. We do those things, not only is your future going to be bright but America\u2019s future is going to bright as well."}

So here\u2019s what I\u2019ve done since I\u2019ve been president. We have increased oil production to the highest levels in 16 years. Natural gas production is the highest it\u2019s been in decades. We have seen increases in coal production and coal employment. But what I\u2019ve also said is we can\u2019t just produce traditional source of energy. We\u2019ve also got to look to the future. That\u2019s why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars. That means that in the middle of the next decade, any car you buy, you\u2019re going to end up going twice as far on a gallon of gas. That\u2019s why we doubled clean \u2014 clean energy production like wind and solar and biofuels. And all these things have contributed to us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in 16 years. Now, I want to build on that. And that means, yes, we still continue to open up new areas for drilling. We continue to make it a priority for us to go after natural gas. We\u2019ve got potentially 600,000 jobs and 100 years worth of energy right beneath our feet with natural gas. And we can do it in an environmentally sound way. But we\u2019ve also got to continue to figure out how we have efficiency energy, because ultimately that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to reduce demand and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to keep gas prices lower. Now, Governor Romney will say he\u2019s got an all-of-the-above plan, but basically his plan is to let the oil companies write the energy policies. So he\u2019s got the oil and gas part, but he doesn\u2019t have the clean energy part. And if we are only thinking about tomorrow or the next day and not thinking about 10 years from now, we\u2019re not going to control our own economic future. Because China, Germany, they\u2019re making these investments. And I\u2019m not going to cede those jobs of the future to those countries. I expect those new energy sources to be built right here in the United States. That\u2019s going to help Jeremy get a job. It\u2019s also going to make sure that you\u2019re not paying as much for gas."}

And the president\u2019s right in terms of the additional oil production, but none of it came on federal land. As a matter of fact, oil production is down 14 percent this year on federal land, and gas production was down 9 percent. Why? Because the president cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands, and in federal waters. So where\u2019d the increase come from? Well a lot of it came from the Bakken Range in North Dakota. What was his participation there? The administration brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil, this massive new resource we have. And what was the cost? 20 or 25 birds were killed and brought out a migratory bird act to go after them on a criminal basis. Look, I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables. I believe very much in our renewable capabilities; ethanol, wind, solar will be an important part of our energy mix. But what we don\u2019t need is to have the president keeping us from taking advantage of oil, coal and gas. This has not been Mr. Oil, or Mr. Gas, or Mr. Coal. Talk to the people that are working in those industries. I was in coal country. People grabbed my arms and said, \u201cPlease save my job.\u201d The head of the EPA said, \u201cYou can\u2019t build a coal plant. You\u2019ll virtually \u2014 it\u2019s virtually impossible given our regulations.\u201d When the president ran for office, he said if you build a coal plant, you can go ahead, but you\u2019ll go bankrupt. That\u2019s not the right course for America. Let\u2019s take advantage of the energy resources we have, as well as the energy sources for the future. And if we do that, if we do what I\u2019m planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, North America energy independence within eight years, you\u2019re going to see manufacturing jobs come back. Because our energy is low cost, that are already beginning to come back because of our abundant energy. I\u2019ll get America and North America energy independent. I\u2019ll do it by more drilling, more permits and licenses. We\u2019re going to bring that pipeline in from Canada. How in the world the president said no to that pipeline? I will never know. This is about bringing good jobs back for the middle class of America, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. CROWLEY: Mr. President, let me just see if I can move you to the gist of this question, which is, are we looking at the new normal? I can tell you that tomorrow morning, a lot of people in Hempstead will wake up and fill up and they will find that the price of gas is over $4 a gallon. Is it within the purview of the government to bring those prices down, or are we looking at the new normal?"}

We\u2019re actually drilling more on public lands than in the previous administration and my \u2014 the previous president was an oil man. And natural gas isn\u2019t just appearing magically. We\u2019re encouraging it and working with the industry. And when I hear Governor Romney say he\u2019s a big coal guy, I mean, keep in mind, when \u2014 Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts, you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, \u201cThis plant kills,\u201d and took great pride in shutting it down. And now suddenly you\u2019re a big champion of coal. So what I\u2019ve tried to do is be consistent. With respect to something like coal, we made the largest investment in clean coal technology, to make sure that even as we\u2019re producing more coal, we\u2019re producing it cleaner and smarter. Same thing with oil, same thing with natural gas. And the proof is our oil imports are down to the lowest levels in 20 years. Oil production is up, natural gas production is up, and, most importantly, we\u2019re also starting to build cars that are more efficient. And that\u2019s creating jobs. That means those cars can be exported, \u2019cause that\u2019s the demand around the world, and it also means that it\u2019ll save money in your pocketbook.

And, you know, I was raised by a single mom who had to put herself through school while looking after two kids. And she worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we got everything we needed. My grandmother, she started off as a secretary in a bank. She never got a college education, even though she was smart as a whip. And she worked her way up to become a vice president of a local bank, but she hit the glass ceiling. She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career. She didn\u2019t complain. That\u2019s not what you did in that generation. And this is one of the reasons why one of the first \u2014 the first bill I signed was something called the Lily Ledbetter bill. And it\u2019s named after this amazing woman who had been doing the same job as a man for years, found out that she was getting paid less, and the Supreme Court said that she couldn\u2019t bring suit because she should have found about it earlier, whereas she had no way of finding out about it. So we fixed that. And that\u2019s an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family. This is not just a women\u2019s issue, this is a family issue, this is a middle-class issue, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to fight for it. It also means that we\u2019ve got to make sure that young people like yourself are able to afford a college education. Earlier, Governor Romney talked about he wants to make Pell Grants and other education accessible for young people. Well, the truth of the matter is, is that that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve expanded Pell Grants for millions of people, including millions of young women, all across the country. We did it by taking $60 billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, and we said, let\u2019s just cut out the middleman. Let\u2019s give the money directly to students. And as a consequence, we\u2019ve seen millions of young people be able to afford college, and that\u2019s going to make sure that young women are going to be able to compete in that marketplace. But we\u2019ve got to enforce the laws, which is what we are doing, and we\u2019ve also got to make sure that in every walk of life we do not tolerate discrimination. That\u2019s been one of the hallmarks of my administration. I\u2019m going to continue to push on this issue for the next four years."}

President Bush and I are \u2014 are different people and these are different times and that\u2019s why my five point plan is so different than what he would have done. I mean for instance, we can now, by virtue of new technology actually get all the energy we need in North America without having to go to the \u2014 the Arabs or the Venezuelans or anyone else. That wasn\u2019t true in his time, that\u2019s why my policy starts with a very robust policy to get all that energy in North America \u2014 become energy secure. Number two, trade \u2014 I\u2019ll crack down on China, President Bush didn\u2019t. I\u2019m also going to dramatically expand trade in Latin America. It\u2019s been growing about 12 percent per year over a long period of time. I want to add more free trade agreements so we\u2019ll have more trade. Number three, I\u2019m going to get us to a balanced budget. President Bush didn\u2019t. President Obama was right, he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years. He was right, but then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four years. And his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large. So that\u2019s the next area I\u2019m different than President Bush. And then let\u2019s take the last one, championing small business. Our party has been focused too long. I came through small business. I understand how hard it is to start a small business. That\u2019s why everything I\u2019ll do is designed to help small businesses grow and add jobs. I want to keep their taxes down on small business. I want regulators to see their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it. And the thing I find the most troubling about Obama Care, well it\u2019s a long list, but one of the things I find most troubling is that when you go out and talk to small businesses and ask them what they think about it, they tell you it keeps them from hiring more people. My priority is jobs. I know how to make that happen. And President Bush has a very different path for a very different time. My path is designed in getting small businesses to grow and hire people."}

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"CANDY CROWLEY","Speaker":"OBAMA","Party":"Democratic","Factor 1":24,"Factor 2":11,"Factor 3":4,"Factor 4":2,"Factor 5":2,"Factor 6":0,"Text":"Well, first of all, I think it\u2019s important to tell you that we did come in during some tough times. We were losing 800,000 jobs a month when I started. But we had been digging our way out of policies that were misplaced and focused on the top doing very well and middle class folks not doing well. Now, we\u2019ve seen 30 consecutive \u2014 31 consecutive months of job growth; 5.2 million new jobs created. And the plans that I talked about will create even more. But when Governor Romney says that he has a very different economic plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan are tax cuts. That\u2019s what took us from surplus to deficit. When he talks about getting tough on China, keep in mind that Governor Romney invested in companies that were pioneers of outsourcing to China, and is currently investing in countries \u2014 in companies that are building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks. That\u2019s \u2014 Governor, you\u2019re the last person who\u2019s going to get tough on China. And what we\u2019ve done when it comes to trade is not only sign three trade deals to open up new markets, but we\u2019ve also set up a task force for trade that goes after anybody who is taking advantage of American workers or businesses and not creating a level playing field. We\u2019ve brought twice as many cases against unfair trading practices than the previous administration and we\u2019ve won every single one that\u2019s been decided. When I said that we had to make sure that China was not flooding our domestic market with cheap tires, Governor Romney said I was being protectionist; that it wouldn\u2019t be helpful to American workers. Well, in fact we saved 1,000 jobs. And that\u2019s the kind of tough trade actions that are required. But the last point I want to make is this. You know, there are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush. George Bush didn\u2019t propose turning Medicare into a voucher. George Bush embraced comprehensive immigration reform. He didn\u2019t call for self-deportation. George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, so there are differences between Governor Romney and George Bush, but they\u2019re not on economic policy. In some ways, he\u2019s gone to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy. And I think that\u2019s a mistake. That\u2019s not how we\u2019re going to move our economy forward."}

There\u2019s no doubt about it. But four years ago, I told the American people and I told you I would cut taxes for middle class families. And I did. I told you I\u2019d cut taxes for small businesses, and I have. I said that I\u2019d end the war in Iraq, and I did. I said we\u2019d refocus attention on those who actually attacked us on 9\/11, and we have gone after Al Qaeda\u2019s leadership like never before and Osama bin Laden is dead. I said that we would put in place health care reform to make sure that insurance companies can\u2019t jerk you around and if you don\u2019t have health insurance, that you\u2019d have a chance to get affordable insurance, and I have. I committed that I would rein in the excesses of Wall Street, and we passed the toughest Wall Street reforms since the 1930s. We\u2019ve created five million jobs, and gone from 800 jobs a month being lost, and we are making progress. We saved an auto industry that was on the brink of collapse. Now, does that mean you\u2019re not struggling? Absolutely not. A lot of us are. And that\u2019s why the plan that I\u2019ve put forward for manufacturing and education, and reducing our deficit in a sensible way, using the savings from ending wars, to rebuild America and putting people back to work. Making sure that we are controlling our own energy, but not only the energy of today, but also the energy of the future. All of those things will make a difference, so the point is the commitments I\u2019ve made, I\u2019ve kept. And those that I haven\u2019t been able to keep, it\u2019s not for lack of trying and we\u2019re going to get it done in a second term. But, you should pay attention to this campaign, because Governor Romney has made some commitments as well. And I suspect he\u2019ll keep those too. You know when members of the Republican Congress say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to sign a no tax pledge, so that we don\u2019t ask a dime for millionaires and billionaires to reduce our deficit so we can still invest in education, and helping kids go to college. He said, \u201cMe too.\u201d When they said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to cut Planned Parenthood funding.\u201d He said, \u201cMe too.\u201d When he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to repeal Obamacare. First thing I\u2019m going to do,\u201d despite the fact that it\u2019s the same health care plan that he passed in Massachusetts and is working well. He said, \u201cMe too.\u201d That is not the kind of leadership that you need, but you should expect that those are promises he\u2019s going to keep."}

I think you know that these last four years haven\u2019t been so good as the president just described and that you don\u2019t feel like your confident that the next four years are going to be much better either. I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what you\u2019re going to get. You\u2019re going to get a repeat of the last four years. We just can\u2019t afford four more years like the last four years. He said that by now we\u2019d have unemployment at 5.4 percent. The difference between where it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million Americans without work. I wasn\u2019t the one that said 5.4 percent. This was the president\u2019s plan. Didn\u2019t get there. He said he would have by now put forward a plan to reform Medicare and Social Security, because he pointed out they\u2019re on the road to bankruptcy. He would reform them. He\u2019d get that done. He hasn\u2019t even made a proposal on either one. He said in his first year he\u2019d put out an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges. Didn\u2019t even file it. This is a president who has not been able to do what he said he\u2019d do. He said that he\u2019d cut in half the deficit. He hasn\u2019t done that either. In fact, he doubled it. He said that by now middle-income families would have a reduction in their health insurance premiums by $2,500 a year. It\u2019s gone up by $2,500 a year. And if Obamacare is passed, or implemented \u2014 it\u2019s already been passed \u2014 if it\u2019s implemented fully, it\u2019ll be another $2,500 on top. The middle class is getting crushed under the policies of a president who has not understood what it takes to get the economy working again. He keeps saying, \u201cLook, I\u2019ve created 5 million jobs.\u201d That\u2019s after losing 5 million jobs. The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country. The unemployment, the number of people who are still looking for work, is still 23 million Americans. There are more people in poverty, one out of six people in poverty. How about food stamps? When he took office, 32 million people were on food stamps. Today, 47 million people are on food stamps. How about the growth of the economy? It\u2019s growing more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before. The president wants to do well. I understand. But the policies he\u2019s put in place from Obamacare to Dodd-Frank to his tax policies to his regulatory policies, these policies combined have not let this economy take off and grow like it could have. You might say, \u201cWell, you got an example of one that worked better?\u201d Yeah, in the Reagan recession where unemployment hit 10.8 percent, between that period \u2014 the end of that recession and the equivalent of time to today, Ronald Reagan\u2019s recovery created twice as many jobs as this president\u2019s recovery. Five million jobs doesn\u2019t even keep up with our population growth. And the only reason the unemployment rate seems a little lower today is because of all the people that have dropped out of the workforce. The president has tried, but his policies haven\u2019t worked. He\u2019s great as a \u2014 as a \u2014 as a speaker and describing his plans and his vision. That\u2019s wonderful, except we have a record to look at. And that record shows he just hasn\u2019t been able to cut the deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare and Social Security to preserve them, to get us the rising incomes we need. Median income is down $4,300 a family and 23 million Americans out of work. That\u2019s what this election is about. It\u2019s about who can get the middle class in this country a bright and prosperous future and assure our kids the kind of hope and optimism they deserve."}

I did not say that the Arizona law was a model for the nation in that aspect. I said that the E-Verify portion of the Arizona law, which is \u2014 which is the portion of the law which says that employers could be able to determine whether someone is here illegally or not illegally, that that was a model for the nation. That\u2019s number one. Number two, I asked the president a question I think Hispanics and immigrants all over the nation have asked. He was asked this on Univision the other day. Why, when you said you\u2019d filed legislation in your first year didn\u2019t you do it? And he didn\u2019t answer. He \u2014 he doesn\u2019t answer that question. He said the standard bearer wasn\u2019t for it. I\u2019m glad you thought I was a standard bearer four years ago, but I wasn\u2019t. Four years ago you said in your first year you would file legislation. In his first year, I was just getting \u2014 licking my wounds from having been beaten by John McCain, all right. I was not the standard bearer. My \u2014 my view is that this president should have honored his promise to do as he said. Now, let me mention one other thing, and that is self-deportation says let people make their own choice. What I was saying is, we\u2019re not going to round up 12 million people, undocumented illegals, and take them out of the nation. Instead let people make their own choice. And if they \u2014 if they find that \u2014 that they can\u2019t get the benefits here that they want and they can\u2019t \u2014 and they can\u2019t find the job they want, then they\u2019ll make a decision to go a place where \u2014 where they have better opportunities. But I\u2019m not in favor of rounding up people and \u2014 and \u2014 and taking them out of this country. I am in favor, as the president has said, and I agree with him, which is that if people have committed crimes we got to get them out of this country. Let me mention something else the president said. It was a moment ago and I didn\u2019t get a chance to, when he was describing Chinese investments and so forth."}

So nobody is more concerned about their safety and security than I am. So as soon as we found out that the Benghazi consulate was being overrun, I was on the phone with my national security team and I gave them three instructions. Number one, beef up our security and procedures, not just in Libya, but at every embassy and consulate in the region. Number two, investigate exactly what happened, regardless of where the facts lead us, to make sure folks are held accountable and it doesn\u2019t happen again. And number three, we are going to find out who did this and we\u2019re going to hunt them down, because one of the things that I\u2019ve said throughout my presidency is when folks mess with Americans, we go after them. Now Governor Romney had a very different response. While we were still dealing with our diplomats being threatened, Governor Romney put out a press release, trying to make political points, and that\u2019s not how a commander in chief operates. You don\u2019t turn national security into a political issue. Certainly not right when it\u2019s happening. And people \u2014 not everybody agrees with some of the decisions I\u2019ve made.

We\u2019ve got a long tradition of hunting and sportsmen and people who want to make sure they can protect themselves. But there have been too many instances during the course of my presidency, where I\u2019ve had to comfort families who have lost somebody. Most recently out in Aurora. You know, just a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably about a month, I saw a mother, who I had met at the bedside of her son, who had been shot in that theater. And her son had been shot through the head. And we spent some time, and we said a prayer and, remarkably, about two months later, this young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable, good as new. But there were a lot of families who didn\u2019t have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands didn\u2019t survive. So my belief is that, (A), we have to enforce the laws we\u2019ve already got, make sure that we\u2019re keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill. We\u2019ve done a much better job in terms of background checks, but we\u2019ve got more to do when it comes to enforcement. But I also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters don\u2019t belong on our streets. And so what I\u2019m trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally. Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced. But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence. Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there\u2019s an awful lot of violence and they\u2019re not using AK-47s. They\u2019re using cheap hand guns. And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that our schools are working; that if there\u2019s violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control. And so what I want is a \u2014 is a comprehensive strategy. Part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. But part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur."}

All those changes in our tax code would make a difference. Now, Governor Romney actually wants to expand those tax breaks. One of his big ideas when it comes to corporate tax reform would be to say, if you invest overseas, you make profits overseas, you don\u2019t have to pay U.S. taxes. But, of course, if you\u2019re a small business or a mom-and-pop business or a big business starting up here, you\u2019ve got to pay even the reduced rate that Governor Romney\u2019s talking about. And it\u2019s estimated that that will create 800,000 new jobs. The problem is they\u2019ll be in china. Or India. Or Germany. That\u2019s not the way we\u2019re going to create jobs here. The way we\u2019re going to create jobs here is not just to change our tax code, but also to double our exports. And we are on pace to double our exports, one of the commitments I made when I was president. That\u2019s creating tens of thousands of jobs all across the country. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve kept on pushing trade deals, but trade deals that make sure that American workers and American businesses are getting a good deal. Now, Governor Romney talked about China, as I already indicated. In the private sector, Governor Romney\u2019s company invested in what were called pioneers of outsourcing. That\u2019s not my phrase. That\u2019s what reporters called it. And as far as currency manipulation, the currency has actually gone up 11 percent since I\u2019ve been president because we have pushed them hard. And we\u2019ve put unprecedented trade pressure on China. That\u2019s why exports have significantly increased under my presidency. That\u2019s going to help to create jobs here."}

In the nature of a campaign, it seems that some campaigns are focused on attacking a person rather than prescribing their own future and the things they\u2019d like to do. In the course of that, I think the president\u2019s campaign has tried to characterize me as \u2014 as someone who\u2019s very different than who I am. I care about 100 percent of the American people. I want 100 percent of the American people to have a bright and prosperous future. I care about our kids. I understand what it takes to make a bright and prosperous future for America again. I spent my life in the private sector, not in government. I\u2019m a guy who wants to help with the experience I have, the American people. My \u2014 my passion probably flows from the fact that I believe in God. And I believe we\u2019re all children of the same God. I believe we have a responsibility to care for one another. I \u2014 I served as a missionary for my church. I served as a pastor in my congregation for about 10 years. I\u2019ve sat across the table from people who were out of work and worked with them to try and find new work or to help them through tough times. I went to the Olympics when they were in trouble to try and get them on track. And as governor of my state, I was able to get 100 percent of my people insured, all my kids, about 98 percent of the adults. I was able also to get our schools ranked number one in the nation, so 100 percent of our kids would have a bright opportunity for a future. I understand that I can get this country on track again. We don\u2019t have to settle for what we\u2019re going through. We don\u2019t have to settle for gasoline at four bucks. We don\u2019t have to settle for unemployment at a chronically high level. We don\u2019t have to settle for 47 million people on food stamps. We don\u2019t have to settle for 50 percent of kids coming out of college not able to get work. We don\u2019t have to settle for 23 million people struggling to find a good job. If I become president, I\u2019ll get America working again. I will get us on track to a balanced budget. The president hasn\u2019t. I will. I\u2019ll make sure we can reform Medicare and Social Security to preserve them for coming \u2014 coming generations. The president said he would. He didn\u2019t."}

There\u2019s a fundamentally different vision about how we move our country forward. I believe Governor Romney is a good man. Loves his family, cares about his faith. But I also believe that when he said behind closed doors that 47 percent of the country considered themselves victims who refuse personal responsibility, think about who he was talking about. Folks on Social Security who\u2019ve worked all their lives. Veterans who\u2019ve sacrificed for this country. Students who are out there trying to hopefully advance their own dreams, but also this country\u2019s dreams. Soldiers who are overseas fighting for us right now.

But Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s. You say that you\u2019re not interested in duplicating what happened in Iraq. But just a few weeks ago, you said you think we should have more troops in Iraq right now.

You said we should have gone into Iraq, despite that fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction. You said that we should still have troops in Iraq to this day. You indicated that we shouldn\u2019t be passing nuclear treaties with Russia despite the fact that 71 senators, Democrats and Republicans, voted for it. You said that, first, we should not have a timeline in Afghanistan. Then you said we should.

First of all, 30,000 people being killed by their government is a humanitarian disaster. Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly right now. Syria is Iran\u2019s only ally in the Arab world. It\u2019s their route to the sea. It\u2019s the route for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally, Israel. And so seeing Syria remove Assad is a very high priority for us. Number two, seeing a \u2014 a replacement government being responsible people is critical for us. And finally, we don\u2019t want to have military involvement there. We don\u2019t want to get drawn into a military conflict. And so the right course for us, is working through our partners and with our own resources, to identify responsible parties within Syria, organize them, bring them together in a \u2014 in a form of \u2014 if not government, a form of \u2014 of \u2014 of council that can take the lead in Syria. And then make sure they have the arms necessary to defend themselves. We do need to make sure that they don\u2019t have arms that get into the \u2014 the wrong hands. Those arms could be used to hurt us down the road. We need to make sure as well that we coordinate this effort with our allies, and particularly with \u2014 with Israel. But the Saudi\u2019s and the Qatari, and \u2014 and the Turks are all very concerned about this. They\u2019re willing to work with us. We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria, making sure that the \u2014 the insurgent there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed, are people who will be the responsible parties. Recognize \u2014 I believe that Assad must go. I believe he will go. But I believe \u2014 we want to make sure that we have the relationships of friendship with the people that take his place, steps that in the years to come we see Syria as a \u2014 as a friend, and Syria as a responsible party in the Middle East. This \u2014 this is a critical opportunity for America. And what I\u2019m afraid of is we\u2019ve watched over the past year or so, first the president saying, well we\u2019ll let the U.N. deal with it. And Assad \u2014 excuse me, Kofi Annan came in and said we\u2019re going to try to have a ceasefire. That didn\u2019t work. Then it went to the Russians and said, let\u2019s see if you can do something. We should be playing the leadership role there, not on the ground with military."}

The notion that we would have tanks run over those young people who were in Tahrir Square, that is not the kind of American leadership that John F. Kennedy talked about 50 years ago. But what I\u2019ve also said is that now that you have a democratically elected government in Egypt, that they have to make sure that they take responsibility for protecting religious minorities. And we have put significant pressure on them to make sure they\u2019re doing that; to recognize the rights of women, which is critical throughout the region. These countries can\u2019t develop if young women are not given the kind of education that they need. They have to abide by their treaty with Israel. That is a red line for us, because not only is Israel\u2019s security at stake, but our security is at stake if that unravels. They have to make sure that they\u2019re cooperating with us when it comes to counterterrorism. And we will help them with respect to developing their own economy, because ultimately what\u2019s going to make the Egyptian revolution successful for the people of Egypt, but also for the world, is if those young people who gathered there are seeing opportunities. Their aspirations are similar to young people\u2019s here. They want jobs, they want to be able to make sure their kids are going to a good school. They want to make sure that they have a roof over their heads and that they have the prospects of a better life in the future. And so one of the things that we\u2019ve been doing is, is, for example, organizing entrepreneurship conferences with these Egyptians to give them a sense of how they can start rebuilding their economy in a way that\u2019s noncorrupt, that\u2019s transparent. But what is also important for us to understand is, is that for America to be successful in this region there\u2019s some things that we\u2019re going to have to do here at home as well. You know, one of the challenges over the last decade is we\u2019ve done experiments in nation building in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and we\u2019ve neglected, for example, developing our own economy, our own energy sectors, our own education system. And it\u2019s very hard for us to project leadership around the world when we\u2019re not doing what we need to do\u2026"}

I wish that, looking back at the beginning of the president\u2019s term and even further back than that, that we\u2019d have recognized that there was a growing energy and passion for freedom in that part of the world, and that we would have worked more aggressively with our friend and with other friends in the region to have them make the transition towards a more representative form of government, such that it didn\u2019t explode in the way that it did. But once it exploded, I felt the same as the president did, which is these freedom voices and the streets of Egypt, where the people who were speaking of our principles and the President Mubarak had done things which were unimaginable and the idea of him crushing his people was not something that we could possibly support. Let me step back and talk about what I think our mission has to be in the Middle East and even more broadly, because our purpose is to make sure the world is more \u2014 is peaceful. We want a peaceful planet. We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know they\u2019re going to have a bright and prosperous future, not be at war. That\u2019s our purpose. And the mantle of leadership for the \u2014 promoting the principles of peace has fallen to America. We didn\u2019t ask for it. But it\u2019s an honor that we have it. But for us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong. And that begins with a strong economy here at home. Unfortunately, the economy is not stronger. When the \u2014 when the president of Iraq \u2014 excuse me, of Iran, Ahmadinejad, says that our debt makes us not a great country, that\u2019s a frightening thing. Former chief of the \u2014 Joint Chiefs of Staff said that \u2014 Admiral Mullen said that our debt is the biggest national security threat we face. This \u2014 we have weakened our economy. We need a strong economy. We need to have as well a strong military. Our military is second to none in the world. We\u2019re blessed with terrific soldiers, and extraordinary technology and intelligence. But the idea of a trillion dollar in cuts through sequestration and budget cuts to the military would change that. We need to have strong allies. Our association and connection with our allies is essential to America\u2019s strength. We\u2019re the great nation that has allies, 42 allies and friends around the world. And, finally, we have to stand by our principles. And if we\u2019re strong in each of those things, American influence will grow. But unfortunately, in nowhere in the world is America\u2019s influence will grow. But unfortunately, in \u2014 nowhere in the world is America\u2019s influence greater today than it was four years ago."}

It also allowed us to refocus on alliances and relationships that had been neglected for a decade. And Governor Romney, our alliances have never been stronger, in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel, where we have unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation, including dealing with the Iranian threat. But what we also have been able to do is position ourselves so we can start rebuilding America, and that\u2019s what my plan does. Making sure that we\u2019re bringing manufacturing back to our shores so that we\u2019re creating jobs here, as we\u2019ve done with the auto industry, not rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas. Making sure that we\u2019ve got the best education system in the world, including retraining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow. Doing everything we can to control our own energy. We\u2019ve cut our oil imports to the lowest level in two decades because we\u2019ve developed oil and natural gas. But we also have to develop clean energy technologies that will allow us to cut our exports in half by 2020. That\u2019s the kind of leadership that we need to show. And we\u2019ve got to make sure that we reduce our deficit. Unfortunately, Governor Romney\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t do it. We\u2019ve got to do it in a responsible way by cutting out spending we don\u2019t need, but also asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more. That way we can invest in the research and technology that\u2019s always kept us at the cutting edge. Now, Governor Romney has taken a different approach throughout this campaign. Both at home and abroad, he has proposed wrong and reckless policies. He\u2019s praised George Bush as a good economic steward and Dick Cheney as somebody who\u2019s \u2014 who shows great wisdom and judgment.

Number one, we are going to have North American energy independence. We\u2019re going to do it by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear and our renewables. Number two, we\u2019re going to increase our trade. Trade grows about 12 percent year. It doubles about every \u2014 every five or so years. We can do better than that, particularly in Latin America. The opportunities for us in Latin America we have just not taken advantage of fully. As a matter of fact, Latin America\u2019s economy is almost as big as the economy of China. We\u2019re all focused on China. Latin America is a huge opportunity for us \u2014 time zone, language opportunities. Number three, we\u2019re going to have to have training programs that work for our workers and schools that finally put the parents and the teachers and the kids first, and the teachers\u2019 unions going to have to go behind. And then we\u2019re going to have to get to a balanced budget. We can\u2019t expect entrepreneurs and businesses large and small to take their life savings or their company\u2019s money and invest in America if they think we\u2019re headed to the road to Greece.

And this is the reason why, working with Israel, we have created the strongest military and intelligence cooperation between our two countries in history. In fact, this week we\u2019ll be carrying out the largest military exercise with Israel in history, this very week. But to the issue of Iran, as long as I\u2019m president of the United States Iran will not get a nuclear weapon. I made that clear when I came into office. We then organized the strongest coalition and the strongest sanctions against Iran in history, and it is crippling their economy. Their currency has dropped 80 percent. Their oil production has plunged to the lowest level since they were fighting a war with Iraq 20 years ago. So their economy is in a shambles. And the reason we did this is because a nuclear Iran is a threat to our national security, and it is a threat to Israel\u2019s national security. We cannot afford to have a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world. Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism. And for them to be able to provide nuclear technology to non-state actors, that\u2019s unacceptable. And they have said that they want to see Israel wiped off the map. So the work that we\u2019ve done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice. They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a United States president, me, who said we\u2019re not going to take any options off the table. The disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that, during the course of this campaign, he\u2019s often talked as if we should take premature military action. I think that would be a mistake, because when I\u2019ve sent young men and women into harm\u2019s way, I always understand that that is the last resort, not the first resort."}

And if Israel is attacked, we have their back, not just diplomatically, not just culturally, but militarily. That\u2019s number one. Number two, with regards to Iran and the threat of Iran, there\u2019s no question but that a nuclear Iran, a nuclear-capable Iran is unacceptable to America. It presents a threat not only to our friends but ultimately a threat to us to have Iran have nuclear material, nuclear weapons that could be used against us or used to be threatening to us. It is also essential for us to understand what our mission is in Iran, and that is to dissuade Iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means. And crippling sanctions are something I called for five years ago, when I was in Israel, speaking at the Herzliya Conference. I laid out seven steps, crippling sanctions were number one. And they do work. You\u2019re seeing it right now in the economy. It\u2019s absolutely the right thing to do, to have crippling sanctions. I would have put them in place earlier. But it\u2019s good that we have them. Number two, something I would add today is I would tighten those sanctions. I would say that ships that carry Iranian oil, can\u2019t come into our ports. I imagine the E.U. would agree with us as well. Not only ships couldn\u2019t, but I\u2019d say companies that are moving their oil can\u2019t, people who are trading in their oil can\u2019t. I would tighten those sanctions further. Secondly, I\u2019d take on diplomatic isolation efforts. I\u2019d make sure that Ahmadinejad is indicted under the Genocide Convention. His words amount to genocide incitation. I would indict him for it. I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world. The same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of South Africa. We need to increase pressure time, and time again on Iran because anything other than a \u2014 a \u2014 a solution to this, which says \u2014 which stops this \u2014 this nuclear folly of theirs, is unacceptable to America. And of course, a military action is the last resort. It is something one would only \u2013 only consider if all of the other avenues had been \u2014 had been tried to their full extent."}

I think they saw weakness where they had expected to find American strength. And I say that because from the very beginning, the president in his campaign four years ago, said he would meet with all the world\u2019s worst actors in his first year, he\u2019d sit down with Chavez and Kim Jong-il, with Castro and President Ahmadinejad of Iran. And I think they looked and thought, well, that\u2019s an unusual honor to receive from the President of the United States. And then the president began what I have called an apology tour, of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America. I think they looked at that and saw weakness. Then when there were dissidents in the streets of Tehran, a Green Revolution, holding signs saying, is America with us, the president was silent. I think they noticed that as well. And I think that when the president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel, that they noticed that as well. All of these things suggested, I think, to the Iranian mullahs that, hey, you know, we can keep on pushing along here, we can keep talks going on, we\u2019re just going to keep on spinning centrifuges. Now there are some 10,000 centrifuges spinning uranium, preparing to create a nuclear threat to the United States and to the world. That\u2019s unacceptable for us, and it\u2019s essential for a president to show strength from the very beginning, to make it very clear what is acceptable and not acceptable. And an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to us. They must not develop nuclear capability. And the way to make sure they understand that is by having, from the very beginning, the tightest sanctions possible. They need to be tightened. Our diplomatic isolation needs to be tougher. We need to indict Ahmadinejad. We need to put the pressure on them as hard as we possibly can, because if we do that, we won\u2019t have to take the military action."}

Nothing Governor Romney just said is true, starting with this notion of me apologizing. This has been probably the biggest whopper that\u2019s been told during the course of this campaign. And every fact checker and every reporter who\u2019s looked at it, Governor, has said this is not true. And when it comes to tightening sanctions, look, as I said before, we\u2019ve put in the toughest, most crippling sanctions ever. And the fact is, while we were coordinating an international coalition to make sure these sanctions were effective, you were still invested in a Chinese state oil company that was doing business with the Iranian oil sector. So I\u2019ll let the American people decide, judge, who\u2019s going to be more effective and more credible when it comes to imposing crippling sanctions. And with respect to our attitude about the Iranian revolution, I was very clear about the murderous activities that had taken place and that was contrary to international law and everything that civilized people stand for. And \u2014 and so the strength that we have shown in Iran is shown by the fact that we\u2019ve been able to mobilize the world. When I came into office, the world was divided. Iran was resurgent. Iran is at its weakest point, economically, strategically, militarily, then since \u2014 then in many years. And we are going to continue to keep the pressure on to make sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon. That\u2019s in America\u2019s national interest and that will be the case so long as I\u2019m president."}

Look, I look at what\u2019s happening around the world, and i see Iran four years closer to a bomb. I see the Middle East with a rising tide of violence, chaos, tumult. I see jihadists continuing to spread, whether they\u2019re rising or just about the same level, hard to precisely measure, but it\u2019s clear they\u2019re there. They\u2019re very strong. I see Syria with 30,000 civilians dead, Assad still in power. I see our trade deficit with China, larger than it\u2019s \u2014 growing larger every year, as a matter of fact. I look around the world and I don\u2019t feel that you see North Korea, continuing to export their nuclear technology, Russia said they\u2019re not going to follow Nunn-Lugar any more. They\u2019re back away from a nuclear proliferation treaty that we had with them. I look around the world, I don\u2019t see our influence growing around the world. I see our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the president to deal with our economic challenges at home; in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way I think it ought to be; in part because of the \u2014 the \u2014 the turmoil with Israel. I mean, the president received a letter from 38 Democrat senators saying the tensions with Israel were a real problem.

The commanders and the generals there are on track to do so. We\u2019ve seen progress over the past several years. The surge has been successful and the training program is proceeding apace. There are now a large number of Afghan Security Forces, 350,000 that are ready to step in to provide security and we\u2019re going to be able to make that transition by the end of 2014. So our troops will come home at that point. I can tell you at the same time, that we will make sure that we look at what\u2019s happening in Pakistan, and recognize that what\u2019s happening in Pakistan is going to have a major impact on the success in Afghanistan. And I say that because I know a lot of people that feel like we should just brush our hands and walk away. And I don\u2019t mean you, Mr. President, but some people in the \u2014 in our nation feel that Pakistan is being nice to us, and that we should walk away fro mthem. But Pakistan is important to the region, to the world and to us, because Pakistan has 100 nuclear warheads and they\u2019re rushing to build a lot more. They\u2019ll have more than Great Britain sometime in the \u2014 in the relatively near future. They also have the Haqqani Network and the Taliban existent within their country. And so a Pakistan that falls apart, becomes a failed state, would be of extraordinary danger to Afghanistan and to us. And so we\u2019re going to have to remain helpful in encouraging Pakistan to move towards a more stable government and rebuild the relationship with us. And that means that our aid that we provide to Pakistan is going to have to be conditioned upon certain benchmarks being met. So for me, I look at this as both a need to help move Pakistan in the right direction, and also to get Afghanistan to be ready, and they will be ready by the end of 2014."}

We created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan. And what we\u2019ve also done is engaged these governments in the kind of reforms that are actually going to make a difference in people\u2019s lives day to day, to make sure that their governments aren\u2019t corrupt, to make sure that they\u2019re treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown and to make sure that they\u2019ve got a free market system that works. So across the board, we are engaging them in building capacity in these countries. And we have stood on the side of democracy. One thing I think Americans should be proud of, when Tunisians began to protest, this nation \u2014 me, my administration \u2014 stood with them earlier than just about any country. In Egypt we stood on the side of democracy. In Libya we stood on the side of the people. And as a consequence, there\u2019s no doubt that attitudes about Americans have changed. But there are always going to be elements in these countries that potentially threaten the United States. And we want to shrink those groups and those networks and we can do that. But we\u2019re always also going to have to maintain vigilance when it comes to terrorist activities. The truth, though, is that Al Qaeda is much weaker than it was when I came into office. And they don\u2019t have the same capacities to attack the U.S. homeland and our allies as they did four years ago."}

We have to remain vigilant, as I just said. But with respect to China, China is both an adversary, but also a potential partner in the international community if it\u2019s following the rules. So my attitude coming into office was that we are going to insist that China plays by the same rules as everybody else. I know Americans had seen jobs being shipped overseas; businesses and workers not getting a level playing field when it came to trade. And that\u2019s the reason why I set up a trade task force to go after cheaters when it came to international trade. That\u2019s the reason why we have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the other \u2014 the previous administration had done in two terms. And we\u2019ve won just about every case that we\u2019ve filed, that has been decided. In fact, just recently steelworkers in Ohio and throughout the Midwest \u2014 Pennsylvania \u2014 are in a position now to sell steel to China because we won that case. We had a tire case in which they were flooding us with cheap domestic tires \u2014 or \u2014 or cheap Chinese tires. And we put a stop to it and as a consequence saved jobs throughout America. I have to say that Governor Romney criticized me for being too tough in that tire case; said this wouldn\u2019t be good for American workers and that it would be protectionist. But I tell you, those workers don\u2019t feel that way. They feel as if they had finally an administration who was going to take this issue seriously. Over the long term, in order for us to compete with China, we\u2019ve also got to make sure, though, that we\u2019re taking \u2014 taking care of business here at home. If we don\u2019t have the best education system in the world, if we don\u2019t continue to put money into research and technology that will allow us to create great businesses here in the United States, that\u2019s how we lose the competition. And, unfortunately, Governor Romney\u2019s budget and his proposals would not allow us to make those investments."}

It\u2019s not government investments that makes businesses grow and hire people. Let me also note that the greatest threat that the world faces, the greatest national security threat is a nuclear Iran. Let\u2019s talk about China. China has an interest that\u2019s very much like ours in one respect, and that is they want a stable world. They don\u2019t want war. They don\u2019t want to see protectionism. They don\u2019t want to see the world break out into \u2014 into various forms of chaos, because they have to \u2014 they have to manufacture goods and put people to work and they have about 20,000 \u2014 20 million, rather, people coming out of the farms every year coming into the cities, needing jobs. So they want the economy to work and the world to be free and open. And so we can be a partner with China. We don\u2019t have to be an adversary in any way, shape or form. We can work with them, we can collaborate with them, if they\u2019re willing to be responsible. Now, they look at us and say, Is it a good idea to be with America? How strong are we going to be? How strong is our economy? They look at the fact that we owe \u2019em a trillion dollars and owe other people $16 trillion in total, including that. They look at our \u2014 our decision to \u2014 to cut back on our military capabilities. A trillion dollars. The secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating. It\u2019s not my term, it\u2019s the president\u2019s own secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating. It\u2019s not my term, it\u2019s the president\u2019s own Secretary of Defense, called them devastating. They look at America\u2019s commitments around the world and they see what\u2019s happening, and they say, well, OK. Is America going to be strong? And the answer is, yes, if I\u2019m president, America will be very strong. We\u2019ll also make sure that we have trade relations with China that work for us. I\u2019ve watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and people have lost their jobs because China has not played by the same rules, in part by holding down artificially the value of their currency. It holds down the prices of their goods. It means our goods aren\u2019t as competitive and we lose jobs. That\u2019s got to end. They\u2019re making some progress; they need to make more. That\u2019s why on day one, i will label them a currency manipulator, which allows us to apply tariffs where they\u2019re taking jobs. They\u2019re stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our goods. They have to understand we want to trade with them. We want a world that\u2019s stable. We like free enterprise, but you got to play by the rules."}

But this can\u2019t keep on going. You can\u2019t keep on holding down the value of your currency, stealing our intellectual property, counterfeiting our products, selling them around the world, even to the United States.

They were counterfeit products being made overseas with the same serial number as a U.S. company, the same packaging, these were being sold into our market and around the world as if they were made by the U.S. competitor.

If we had taken your advice Governor Romney about our auto industry, we\u2019d be buying cars from China instead of selling cars to China. If we take your advice with respect to how we change our tax codes so that companies that earn profits overseas don\u2019t pay U.S. taxes compared to companies here that are paying taxes.

Now with respect to what we\u2019ve done with China already, U.S. exports have doubled since I came into office, to China and actually currencies are at their most advantageous point for U.S. exporters since 1993. We absolutely have to make more progress and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to keep on pressing. And when it comes to our military and Chinese security, part of the reason that we were able to pivot to the Asia-Pacific region after having ended the war in Iraq and transitioning out of Afghanistan, is precisely because this is going to be a massive growth area in the future. And we believe China can be a partner, but we\u2019re also sending a very clear signal that America is a Pacific power; that we are going to have a presence there. We are working with countries in the region to make sure, for example, that ships can pass through; that commerce continues.

This is not research, Mr President, these are the government investing in companies. Investing in Solyndra. This is a company, this isn\u2019t basic research. I \u2014 I want to invest in research. Research is great. Providing funding to universities and think tanks is great. But investing in companies? Absolutely not."}

Having a tax code that rewards companies that are shipping jobs overseas instead of companies that are investing here in the United States, that will not make us more competitive. And the one thing that I\u2019m absolutely clear about is that after a decade in which we saw drift, jobs being shipped overseas, nobody championing American workers and American businesses, we\u2019ve now begun to make some real progress.

You\u2019ve now heard three debates, months of campaigning and way too many TV commercials. And now you\u2019ve got a choice. Over the last four years we\u2019ve made real progress digging our way out of policies that gave us two prolonged wars, record deficits and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. And Governor Romney wants to take us back to those policies, a foreign policy that\u2019s wrong and reckless, economic policies that won\u2019t create jobs, won\u2019t reduce our deficit, but will make sure that folks at the very top don\u2019t have to play by the same rules that you do. And I\u2019ve got a different vision for America. I want to build on our strengths. And I\u2019ve put forward a plan to make sure that we\u2019re bringing manufacturing jobs back to our shores by rewarding companies and small businesses that are investing here, not overseas. I want to make sure we\u2019ve got the best education system in the world. And we\u2019re retaining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow. I want to control our own energy by developing oil and natural gas but also the energy sources of the future. Yes, I want to reduce our deficit by cutting spending that we don\u2019t need but also by asking the wealthy to do a little bit more so that we can invest in things like research and technology that are the key to a 21st century economy. As Commander in Chief, I will maintain the strongest military in the world, keep faith with our troops and go after those who would do us harm. but after a decade of war, I think we all recognize we\u2019ve got to do some nation building here at home, rebuilding our roads, our bridges and especially caring for our Veterans who sacrificed so much for our freedom. And we\u2019ve been through tough times but we always bounce back because of our character, because we pull together and if I have the privilege of being your president for another four years, I promise you I will always listen to your voices.

I can\u2019t think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country. You know, we are at a defining moment in our history. Our nation is involved in two wars, and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And although we\u2019ve heard a lot about Wall Street, those of you on Main Street I think have been struggling for a while, and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy. And you\u2019re wondering, how\u2019s it going to affect me? How\u2019s it going to affect my job? How\u2019s it going to affect my house? How\u2019s it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college? So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely. And I\u2019ve put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort. Number one, we\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019ve got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money. Number two, we\u2019ve got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market \u2014 and when the market returns. Number three, we\u2019ve got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes. And, number four, we\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country. Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down. It hasn\u2019t worked. And I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for president, and that\u2019s what I hope we\u2019re going to be talking about tonight."}

And, Jim, I \u2014 I\u2019ve been not feeling too great about a lot of things lately. So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges. But I\u2019m feeling a little better tonight, and I\u2019ll tell you why. Because as we\u2019re here tonight in this debate, we are seeing, for the first time in a long time, Republicans and Democrats together, sitting down, trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that we\u2019re in. And have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis. And we\u2019re not talking about failure of institutions on Wall Street. We\u2019re talking about failures on Main Street, and people who will lose their jobs, and their credits, and their homes, if we don\u2019t fix the greatest fiscal crisis, probably in \u2014 certainly in our time, and I\u2019ve been around a little while. But the point is \u2014 the point is, we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package. This package has transparency in it. It has to have accountability and oversight. It has to have options for loans to failing businesses, rather than the government taking over those loans. We have to \u2014 it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it. And, yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives. And they weren\u2019t part of the negotiations, and I understand that. And it was the House Republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem. But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight. This isn\u2019t the beginning of the end of this crisis. This is the end of the beginning, if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable. And we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do. And we\u2019ve got to create jobs. And one of the areas, of course, is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil."}

The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place? Two years ago, I warned that, because of the subprime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time. Last year, I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it. So \u2014 so the question, I think, that we\u2019ve got to ask ourselves is, yes, we\u2019ve got to solve this problem short term. And we are going to have to intervene; there\u2019s no doubt about that. But we\u2019re also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations? We did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems. And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad."}

President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters. One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever. And he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy. Somehow we\u2019ve lost that accountability. I\u2019ve been heavily criticized because I called for the resignation of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We\u2019ve got to start also holding people accountable, and we\u2019ve got to reward people who succeed. But somehow in Washington today \u2014 and I\u2019m afraid on Wall Street \u2014 greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption \u2014 or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded. As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration. And I promise you that that will happen."}

And he\u2019s also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn\u2019t the case with me. But let\u2019s be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year\u2019s budget. Senator McCain is proposing \u2014 and this is a fundamental difference between us \u2014 $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion. Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important. And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out. So my attitude is, we\u2019ve got to grow the economy from the bottom up. What I\u2019ve called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent. And that means that the ordinary American out there who\u2019s collecting a paycheck every day, they\u2019ve got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them. And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the \u2014 the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to \u2014 wants to follow."}

I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage. I think those are pretty important priorities. And I pay for every dime of it. But let\u2019s go back to the original point. John, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important. And, absolutely, we need earmark reform. And when I\u2019m president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely. But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we\u2019re going to get the middle class back on track.

And if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dime\u2019s worth of tax increase. Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and he\u2019s absolutely right. Here\u2019s the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world. And what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more. It\u2019s not like you want to close the loopholes. You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes. And that\u2019s a problem. Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5,000 health credit. Now, what he doesn\u2019t tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits. So you may end up getting a $5,000 tax credit. Here\u2019s the only problem: Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that you\u2019re getting from your employer. And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, you\u2019ve got to go out on the open market and try to buy it. It is not a good deal for the American people. But it\u2019s an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off we\u2019re going to be."}

We don\u2019t yet know what our tax revenues are going to be. The economy is slowing down, so it\u2019s hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year. But there\u2019s no doubt that we\u2019re not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done. There are some things that I think have to be done. We have to have energy independence, so I\u2019ve put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years\u2019 time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on Middle Eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy, solar, wind, biodiesel, making sure that we\u2019re developing the fuel-efficient cars of the future right here in the United States, in Ohio and Michigan, instead of Japan and South Korea. We have to fix our health care system, which is putting an enormous burden on families. Just \u2014 a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families. They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care. I\u2019m meeting folks all over the country. We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off. The third thing we have to do is we\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re competing in education. We\u2019ve got to invest in science and technology. China had a space launch and a space walk. We\u2019ve got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science. And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America. And I also think that we\u2019re going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities. Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them. So there are some \u2014 some things that we\u2019ve got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy. We can\u2019t shortchange those things. We\u2019ve got to eliminate programs that don\u2019t work, and we\u2019ve got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less."}

It\u2019s hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left. The point \u2014 the point is \u2014 the point is, we need to examine every agency of government. First of all, by the way, I\u2019d eliminate ethanol subsidies. I oppose ethanol subsidies. I think that we have to return \u2014 particularly in defense spending, which is the largest part of our appropriations \u2014 we have to do away with cost-plus contracts. We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control. We tried to build a little ship called the Littoral Combat Ship that was supposed to cost $140 million, ended up costing $400 million, and we still haven\u2019t done it. So we need to have fixed-cost contracts. We need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control. I know how to do that. I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong. And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this because I\u2019ve been involved these issues for many, many years. But I think that we have to examine every agency of government and find out those that are doing their job and keep them and find out those that aren\u2019t and eliminate them and we\u2019ll have to scrub every agency of government."}

They just skim off $15 billion. That was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works.

Now six years ago, I stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world, and whether our intelligence was sound, but also because we hadn\u2019t finished the job in Afghanistan. We hadn\u2019t caught bin Laden. We hadn\u2019t put al Qaeda to rest, and as a consequence, I thought that it was going to be a distraction. Now Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment. And I wish I had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right, but that\u2019s not the case. We\u2019ve spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion. We have lost over 4,000 lives. We have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001. We took our eye off the ball. And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government. So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and I will not, as president, in order to keep the American people safe. But we have to use our military wisely. And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq."}

I\u2019ve been saying that for over a year now. And I think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because it\u2019s been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better. We had the highest fatalities among U.S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002. And we are seeing a major offensive taking place \u2014 Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion. They are feeling emboldened. And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we don\u2019t have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan. So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan. Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9\/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no Al Qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan. And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front \u2014 that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan. So here\u2019s what we have to do comprehensively, though. It\u2019s not just more troops. We have to press the Afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people. And I\u2019ve said this to President Karzai. Number two, we\u2019ve got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years. Number three, we\u2019ve got to deal with Pakistan, because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, we\u2019ve been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens. And until we do, Americans here at home are not going to be safe."}

And the result over time was the Taliban, Al Qaida, and a lot of the difficulties we are facing today. So we can\u2019t ignore those lessons of history. Now, on this issue of aiding Pakistan, if you\u2019re going to aim a gun at somebody, George Shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, you\u2019d better be prepared to pull the trigger. I\u2019m not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan. So I\u2019m not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan. We\u2019ve got to get the support of the people of \u2014 of Pakistan. He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan. Now, you don\u2019t do that. You don\u2019t say that out loud. If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government. Now, the new president of Pakistan, Kardari (sic), has got his hands full. And this area on the border has not been governed since the days of Alexander the Great. I\u2019ve been to Waziristan. I can see how tough that terrain is. It\u2019s ruled by a handful of tribes. And, yes, Senator Obama calls for more troops, but what he doesn\u2019t understand, it\u2019s got to be a new strategy, the same strategy that he condemned in Iraq. It\u2019s going to have to be employed in Afghanistan. And we\u2019re going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people. And it\u2019s going to be tough. They\u2019ve intermarried with Al Qaida and the Taliban. And it\u2019s going to be tough. But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas. And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they don\u2019t want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements. So we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan. But I\u2019m confident, now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops \u2014 and, by the way, there have been 20,000 additional troops, from 32,000 to 53,000, and there needs to be more. So it\u2019s not just the addition of troops that matters. It\u2019s a strategy that will succeed. And Pakistan is a very important element in this. And I know how to work with them. And I guarantee you I would not publicly state that I\u2019m going to attack them."}

We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions. And the problem, John, with the strategy that\u2019s been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled Musharraf, we alienated the Pakistani population, because we were anti-democratic. We had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, \u201cWell, you know, he may be a dictator, but he\u2019s our dictator.\u201d And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan. We spent $10 billion. And in the meantime, they weren\u2019t going after Al Qaida, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan. That\u2019s going to change when I\u2019m president of the United States."}

Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state. But let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing Iran and all that, let me tell you my record. Back in 1983, when I was a brand-new United States congressman, the one \u2014 the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon. And I saw that, and I saw the situation, and I stood up, and I voted against that, because I was afraid that they couldn\u2019t make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference. Tragically, I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks. And then we had Somalia \u2014 then we had the first Gulf War. I supported \u2014 I supported that. I supported us going into Bosnia, when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in Bosnia. That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe. I supported what we did in Kosovo. I supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there. And I have a record \u2014 and Somalia, I opposed that we should turn \u2014 turn the force in Somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of. So I have a record. I have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harm\u2019s way. And I\u2019ll tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, \u201cSenator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son\u2019s name on it.\u201d He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad, Matthew Stanley, before Christmas last year. This was last August, a year ago. And I said, \u201cI will \u2014 I will wear his bracelet with honor.\u201d And this was August, a year ago. And then she said, \u201cBut, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything \u2014 promise me one thing, that you\u2019ll do everything in your power to make sure that my son\u2019s death was not in vain.\u201d That means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re-enlisted in Baghdad, just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed. And they all say to me that we don\u2019t want defeat. I know what that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like when an army is defeated. A war that I was in, where we had an Army, that it wasn\u2019t through any fault of their own, but they were defeated. And I know how hard it is for that \u2014 for an Army and a military to recover from that. And it did and we will win this one and we won\u2019t come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail."}

And the point that I originally made is that we took our eye off Afghanistan, we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9\/11, they are still sending out videotapes and Senator McCain, nobody is talking about defeat in Iraq, but I have to say we are having enormous problems in Afghanistan because of that decision. And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan. At one point, while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can \u201cmuddle through\u201d Afghanistan. You don\u2019t muddle through the central front on terror and you don\u2019t muddle through going after bin Laden. You don\u2019t muddle through stamping out the Taliban.

Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust. Let\u2019s just make that very clear. What I have proposed for a long time, and I\u2019ve had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, let\u2019s be clear and let\u2019s have some straight talk. The Russians are preventing significant action in the United Nations Security Council. I have proposed a league of democracies, a group of people \u2013 a group of countries that share common interests, common values, common ideals, they also control a lot of the world\u2019s economic power. We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect. The Iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues. So I am convinced that together, we can, with the French, with the British, with the Germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect Iranian behavior. But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight. And it is a threat not only in this region but around the world. What I\u2019d also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans, there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran. There is the Republican Guard in Iran, which Senator Kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror. Senator Obama said that would be provocative. So this is a serious threat. This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons."}

His first statement was, \u201cBoth sides ought to show restraint.\u201d Again, a little bit of naivete there. He doesn\u2019t understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia. And Russia has now become a nation fueled by petro-dollars that is basically a KGB apparatchik-run government. I looked into Mr. Putin\u2019s eyes, and I saw three letters, a \u201cK,\u201d a \u201cG,\u201d and a \u201cB.\u201d And their aggression in Georgia is not acceptable behavior. I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to go back to the Cold War. I am sure that that will not happen. But I do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies. And that wasn\u2019t just about a problem between Georgia and Russia. It had everything to do with energy. There\u2019s a pipeline that runs from the Caspian through Georgia through Turkey. And, of course, we know that the Russians control other sources of energy into Europe, which they have used from time to time. It\u2019s not accidental that the presidents of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine flew to Georgia, flew to Tbilisi, where I have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, Misha Saakashvili. And they showed solidarity with them, but, also, they are very concerned about the Russian threats to regain their status of the old Russian to regain their status of the old Russian empire. Now, I think the Russians ought to understand that we will support \u2014 we, the United States \u2014 will support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in the natural process, inclusion into NATO. We also ought to make it very clear that the Russians are in violation of their cease-fire agreement. They have stationed additional troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. By the way, I went there once, and we went inside and drove in, and there was a huge poster. And this is \u2014 this is Georgian territory. And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin, and it said, \u201cVladimir Putin, our president.\u201d It was very clear, the Russian intentions towards Georgia. They were just waiting to seize the opportunity. So, this is a very difficult situation. We want to work with the Russians. But we also have every right to expect the Russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a \u2014 with a \u2014 with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior. And watch Ukraine. This whole thing has got a lot to do with Ukraine, Crimea, the base of the Russian fleet in Sevastopol. And the breakdown of the political process in Ukraine between Tymoshenko and Yushchenko is a very serious problem. So watch Ukraine, and let\u2019s make sure that we \u2014 that the Ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally."}

Obviously, I disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to Russians going into Georgia. I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable. And, absolutely, I wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on Georgia, and that\u2019s why I was the first to say that we have to rebuild the Georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild. Because part of Russia\u2019s intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more. Two points I think are important to think about when it comes to Russia. Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems. So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory. That made no sense whatsoever. And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over. That wasn\u2019t done. But had it been done, it\u2019s possible we could have avoided the issue. The second point I want to make is \u2014 is the issue of energy. Russia is in part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as Senator McCain mentioned. That means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil \u2014 25 percent of the world\u2019s oil \u2014 have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with Russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states we\u2019ve talked about, Iran, Venezuela. And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world\u2019s oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world\u2019s oil. So we can\u2019t simply drill our way out of the problem. What we\u2019re going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology. And, you know, I\u2019ve got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that. And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record. Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel. And so we \u2014 we \u2014 we\u2019ve got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump \u2014 and, you know, winter\u2019s coming and home heating oil \u2014 as it is our national security and the issue of climate change that\u2019s so important."}

But after 9\/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9\/11, and find out what happened, and fix it. And we were \u2014 we were opposed by the administration, another area where I differed with this administration.

And, Governor, it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, and it\u2019s a pleasure to be with you. I think it\u2019s neither the best or worst of Washington, but it\u2019s evidence of the fact that the economic policies of the last eight years have been the worst economic policies we\u2019ve ever had. As a consequence, you\u2019ve seen what\u2019s happened on Wall Street. If you need any more proof positive of how bad the economic theories have been, this excessive deregulation, the failure to oversee what was going on, letting Wall Street run wild, I don\u2019t think you needed any more evidence than what you see now. So the Congress has been put \u2014 Democrats and Republicans have been put in a very difficult spot. But Barack Obama laid out four basic criteria for any kind of rescue plan here. He, first of all, said there has to be oversight. We\u2019re not going to write any check to anybody unless there\u2019s oversight for the \u2014 of the secretary of Treasury. He secondly said you have to focus on homeowners and folks on Main Street. Thirdly, he said that you have to treat the taxpayers like investors in this case. And, lastly, what you have to do is make sure that CEOs don\u2019t benefit from this, because this could end up, in the long run, people making money off of this rescue plan. And so, as a consequence of that, it brings us back to maybe the fundamental disagreement between Governor Palin and me and Senator McCain and Barack Obama, and that is that the \u2014 we\u2019re going to fundamentally change the focus of the economic policy. We\u2019re going to focus on the middle class, because it\u2019s \u2014 when the middle class is growing, the economy grows and everybody does well, not just focus on the wealthy and corporate America."}

And I thank the commission, also. I appreciate this privilege of being able to be here and speak with Americans. You know, I think a good barometer here, as we try to figure out has this been a good time or a bad time in America\u2019s economy, is go to a kid\u2019s soccer game on Saturday, and turn to any parent there on the sideline and ask them, \u201cHow are you feeling about the economy?\u201d And I\u2019ll bet you, you\u2019re going to hear some fear in that parent\u2019s voice, fear regarding the few investments that some of us have in the stock market. Did we just take a major hit with those investments? Fear about, how are we going to afford to send our kids to college? A fear, as small-business owners, perhaps, how we\u2019re going to borrow any money to increase inventory or hire more people. The barometer there, I think, is going to be resounding that our economy is hurting and the federal government has not provided the sound oversight that we need and that we deserve, and we need reform to that end. Now, John McCain thankfully has been one representing reform. Two years ago, remember, it was John McCain who pushed so hard with the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reform measures. He sounded that warning bell. People in the Senate with him, his colleagues, didn\u2019t want to listen to him and wouldn\u2019t go towards that reform that was needed then. I think that the alarm has been heard, though, and there will be that greater oversight, again thanks to John McCain\u2019s bipartisan efforts that he was so instrumental in bringing folks together over this past week, even suspending his own campaign to make sure he was putting excessive politics aside and putting the country first."}

Now, Barack Obama, of course, he\u2019s pretty much only voted along his party lines. In fact, 96 percent of his votes have been solely along party line, not having that proof for the American people to know that his commitment, too, is, you know, put the partisanship, put the special interests aside, and get down to getting business done for the people of America. We\u2019re tired of the old politics as usual.

We let Wall Street run wild. John McCain and he\u2019s a good man, but John McCain thought the answer is that tried and true Republican response, deregulate, deregulate. So what you had is you had overwhelming \u201cderegulation.\u201d You had actually the belief that Wall Street could self-regulate itself. And while Barack Obama was talking about reinstating those regulations, John on 20 different occasions in the previous year and a half called for more deregulation. As a matter of fact, John recently wrote an article in a major magazine saying that he wants to do for the health care industry deregulate it and let the free market move like he did for the banking industry. So deregulation was the promise. And guess what? Those people who say don\u2019t go into debt, they can barely pay to fill up their gas tank. I was recently at my local gas station and asked a guy named Joey Danco (ph). I said Joey, how much did it cost to fill your tank? You know what his answer was? He said I don\u2019t know, Joe.

No one making less than $250,000 under Barack Obama\u2019s plan will see one single penny of their tax raised whether it\u2019s their capital gains tax, their income tax, investment tax, any tax. And 95 percent of the people in the United States of America making less than $150,000 will get a tax break. Now, that seems to me to be simple fairness. The economic engine of America is middle class. It\u2019s the people listening to this broadcast. When you do well, America does well. Even the wealthy do well. This is not punitive. John wants to add $300 million, billion in new tax cuts per year for corporate America and the very wealthy while giving virtually nothing to the middle class. We have a different value set.

And those huge tax breaks aren\u2019t coming to the big multinational corporations anymore, not when it adversely affects the people who live in a state and, in this case, in a country who should be benefiting at the same time. So it was Barack Obama who voted for that energy plan that gave those tax breaks to the oil companies that I then had to turn around, as a governor of an energy-producing state, and kind of undo in my own area of expertise, and that\u2019s energy."}

And let me just ask a rhetorical question - If John really wanted to eliminate them, why is he adding to his budget an additional $4 billion in tax cuts for ExxonMobils of the world that, in fact, already have made $600 billion since 2001? And, look, I agree with the governor. She imposed a windfall profits tax up there in Alaska. That\u2019s what Barack Obama and I want to do. We want to be able to do for all of you Americans, give you back $1,000 bucks, like she\u2019s been able to give back money to her folks back there.

They\u2019ve made $600 billion since 2001, and John McCain wants to give them, all by itself \u2014 separate, no additional bill, all by itself \u2014 another $4 billion tax cut.

When we talk about energy, we have to consider the need to do all that we can to allow this nation to become energy independent. It\u2019s a nonsensical position that we are in when we have domestic supplies of energy all over this great land. And East Coast politicians who don\u2019t allow energy-producing states like Alaska to produce these, to tap into them, and instead we\u2019re relying on foreign countries to produce for us.

He voted against it. He voted against funding because he said the amendment had a time line in it to end this war, and he didn\u2019t like that.

John McCain and Dick Cheney said when I was saying we would not be greeted as liberators, we would not \u2013 this war would take a decade, not a day, not a week, not six months, we would not be out of there quickly. John McCain was saying the Sunnis and Shias got along with each other without reading the history of the last 700 years. John McCain said there would be enough oil to pay for this. John McCain has been dead wrong. I love him. As my mother would say, god love him, but he\u2019s been dead wrong on the fundamental issues relating to the conduct of the war.

You don\u2019t have to believe me or John McCain on that. I would believe Petraeus and that leader of al Qaeda. An armed, nuclear armed especially, Iran is so extremely dangerous to consider. They cannot be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons period. Israel is in jeopardy of course when we\u2019re dealing with Ahmadinejad as a leader of Iran. Iran claiming that Israel is, he termed it, a stinking corpse, a country that should be wiped off the face of the earth. Now a leader like Ahmadinejad who is not sane or stable when he says things like that is not one whom we can allow to acquire nuclear energy, nuclear weapons. Ahmadinejad, Kim Jong Il, the Castro brothers, others who are dangerous dictators are ones that Barack Obama has said he would be willing to meet with without preconditions being met first. An issue like that taken up by a presidential candidate goes beyond naivete and goes beyond poor judgment. A statement that he made like that is downright dangerous, because leaders like Ahmadinejad who would seek to acquire nuclear weapons and wipe off the face of the earth an ally like we have in Israel should not be met with without preconditions and diplomatic efforts being undertaken first."}

Look, we have spent more money \u2014 we spend more money in three weeks on combat in Iraq than we spent on the entirety of the last seven years that we have been in Afghanistan building that country.

John McCain voted against a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty that every Republican has supported. John McCain has opposed amending the Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty with an amendment to allow for inspections. John McCain has not been \u2014 has not been the kind of supporter for dealing with \u2014 and let me put it another way. My time is almost up. Barack Obama, first thing he did when he came to the United States Senate, new senator, reached across the aisle to my colleague, Dick Lugar, a Republican, and said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something about keeping nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists.\u201d They put together a piece of legislation that, in fact, was serious and real.

We took Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks, being told by everyone, I was told by everyone that this would mean that they had been killing each other for a thousand years, it would never work. There\u2019s a relatively stable government there now as in Kosovo. With regard to Iraq, I indicated it would be a mistake to \u2014 I gave the president the power. I voted for the power because he said he needed it not to go to war but to keep the United States, the UN in line, to keep sanctions on Iraq and not let them be lifted. I, along with Dick Lugar, before we went to war, said if we were to go to war without our allies, without the kind of support we need, we\u2019d be there for a decade and it\u2019d cost us tens of billions of dollars.

What I\u2019ve done in my position to help, as the governor of a state that\u2019s pretty rich in natural resources, we have a $40 billion investment fund, a savings fund called the Alaska Permanent Fund. When I and others in the legislature found out we had some millions of dollars in Sudan, we called for divestment through legislation of those dollars to make sure we weren\u2019t doing anything that would be seen as condoning the activities there in Darfur.

A policy that would in fact engage our allies in making sure that we knew we were acting on the same page and not dictating.

We\u2019ve been there also so that connection was important. But even more important is that worldview that I share with John McCain. That worldview that says that America is a nation of exceptionalism. And we are to be that shining city on a hill, as President Reagan so beautifully said, that we are a beacon of hope and that we are unapologetic here. We are not perfect as a nation. But together, we represent a perfect ideal, and that is democracy and tolerance and freedom and equal rights.

I think everybody knows now we are in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And a lot of you I think are worried about your jobs, your pensions, your retirement accounts, your ability to send your child or your grandchild to college. And I believe this is a final verdict on the failed economic policies of the last eight years, strongly promoted by President Bush and supported by Senator McCain, that essentially said that we should strip away regulations, consumer protections, let the market run wild, and prosperity would rain down on all of us. It hasn\u2019t worked out that way. And so now we\u2019ve got to take some decisive action. Now, step one was a rescue package that was passed last week. We\u2019ve got to make sure that works properly. And that means strong oversight, making sure that investors, taxpayers are getting their money back and treated as investors. It means that we are cracking down on CEOs and making sure that they\u2019re not getting bonuses or golden parachutes as a consequence of this package. And, in fact, we just found out that AIG, a company that got a bailout, just a week after they got help went on a $400,000 junket. And I\u2019ll tell you what, the Treasury should demand that money back and those executives should be fired. But that\u2019s only step one. The middle-class need a rescue package. And that means tax cuts for the middle-class. It means help for homeowners so that they can stay in their homes. It means that we are helping state and local governments set up road projects and bridge projects that keep people in their jobs. And then long-term we\u2019ve got to fix our health care system, we\u2019ve got to fix our energy system that is putting such an enormous burden on families. You need somebody working for you and you\u2019ve got to have somebody in Washington who is thinking about the middle class and not just those who can afford to hire lobbyists."}

Now, I have a plan to fix this problem and it has got to do with energy independence.

And I think that this problem has become so severe, as you know, that we\u2019re going to have to do something about home values. You know that home values of retirees continues to decline and people are no longer able to afford their mortgage payments. As president of the United States, Alan, I would order the secretary of the treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America and renegotiate at the new value of those homes \u2014 at the diminished value of those homes and let people be able to make those \u2014 be able to make those payments and stay in their homes.

I left my campaign and suspended it to go back to Washington to make sure that there were additional protections for the taxpayer in the form of good oversight, in the form of taxpayers being the first to be paid back when our economy recovers \u2014 and it will recover \u2014 and a number of other measures. But you know, one of the real catalysts, really the match that lit this fire was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I\u2019ll bet you, you may never even have heard of them before this crisis. But you know, they\u2019re the ones that, with the encouragement of Senator Obama and his cronies and his friends in Washington, that went out and made all these risky loans, gave them to people that could never afford to pay back. And you know, there were some of us that stood up two years ago and said we\u2019ve got to enact legislation to fix this. We\u2019ve got to stop this greed and excess. Meanwhile, the Democrats in the Senate and some \u2014 and some members of Congress defended what Fannie and Freddie were doing. They resisted any change. Meanwhile, they were getting all kinds of money in campaign contributions. Senator Obama was the second highest recipient of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac money in history \u2014 in history. So this rescue package means that we will stabilize markets, we will shore up these institutions. But it\u2019s not enough. That\u2019s why we\u2019re going to have to go out into the housing market and we\u2019re going to have to buy up these bad loans and we\u2019re going to have to stabilize home values, and that way, Americans, like Alan, can realize the American dream and stay in their home. But Fannie and Freddie were the catalysts, the match that started this forest fire. There were some of us \u2014 there were some of us that stood up against it. There were others who took a hike."}

Right now, the credit markets are frozen up and what that means, as a practical matter, is that small businesses and some large businesses just can\u2019t get loans. If they can\u2019t get a loan, that means that they can\u2019t make payroll. If they can\u2019t make payroll, then they may end up having to shut their doors and lay people off. And if you imagine just one company trying to deal with that, now imagine a million companies all across the country. So it could end up having an adverse effect on everybody, and that\u2019s why we had to take action. But we shouldn\u2019t have been there in the first place. Now, I\u2019ve got to correct a little bit of Senator McCain\u2019s history, not surprisingly. Let\u2019s, first of all, understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system. Senator McCain, as recently as March, bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator. On the other hand, two years ago, I said that we\u2019ve got a sub-prime lending crisis that has to be dealt with. I wrote to Secretary Paulson, I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, and told them this is something we have to deal with, and nobody did anything about it. A year ago, I went to Wall Street and said we\u2019ve got to reregulate, and nothing happened. And Senator McCain during that period said that we should keep on deregulating because that\u2019s how the free enterprise system works. Now, with respect to Fannie Mae, what Senator McCain didn\u2019t mention is the fact that this bill that he talked about wasn\u2019t his own bill. He jumped on it a year after it had been introduced and it never got passed. And I never promoted Fannie Mae. In fact, Senator McCain\u2019s campaign chairman\u2019s firm was a lobbyist on behalf of Fannie Mae, not me. So \u2014 but, look, you\u2019re not interested in hearing politicians pointing fingers. What you\u2019re interested in is trying to figure out, how is this going to impact you? This is not the end of the process; this is the beginning of the process. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s going to be so important for us to work with homeowners to make sure that they can stay in their homes. The secretary already has the power to do that in the rescue package, but it hasn\u2019t been exercised yet. And the next president has to make sure that the next Treasury secretary is thinking about how to strengthen you as a home buyer, you as a homeowner, and not simply think about bailing out banks on Wall Street."}

If less money is coming in, you end up making cuts. Maybe you don\u2019t go out to dinner as much. Maybe you put off buying a new car. That\u2019s not what happens in Washington. And you\u2019re right. There is a lot of blame to go around. But I think it\u2019s important just to remember a little bit of history. When George Bush came into office, we had surpluses. And now we have half-a-trillion-dollar deficit annually. When George Bush came into office, our debt \u2014 national debt was around $5 trillion. It\u2019s now over $10 trillion. We\u2019ve almost doubled it. And so while it\u2019s true that nobody\u2019s completely innocent here, we have had over the last eight years the biggest increases in deficit spending and national debt in our history. And Senator McCain voted for four out of five of those George Bush budgets. So here\u2019s what I would do. I\u2019m going to spend some money on the key issues that we\u2019ve got to work on. You know, you may have seen your health care premiums go up. We\u2019ve got to reform health care to help you and your budget. We are going to have to deal with energy because we can\u2019t keep on borrowing from the Chinese and sending money to Saudi Arabia. We are mortgaging our children\u2019s future. We\u2019ve got to have a different energy plan. We\u2019ve got to invest in college affordability. So we\u2019re going to have to make some investments, but we\u2019ve also got to make spending cuts. And what I\u2019ve proposed, you\u2019ll hear Senator McCain say, well, he\u2019s proposing a whole bunch of new spending, but actually I\u2019m cutting more than I\u2019m spending so that it will be a net spending cut. The key is whether or not we\u2019ve got priorities that are working for you as opposed to those who have been dictating the policy in Washington lately, and that\u2019s mostly lobbyists and special interests. We\u2019ve got to put an end to that."}

And I can see why you feel that cynicism and mistrust, because the system in Washington is broken. And I have been a consistent reformer. I have advocated and taken on the special interests, whether they be the big money people by reaching across the aisle and working with Senator Feingold on campaign finance reform, whether it being a variety of other issues, working with Senator Lieberman on trying to address climate change. I have a clear record of bipartisanship. The situation today cries out for bipartisanship. Senator Obama has never taken on his leaders of his party on a single issue. And we need to reform. And so let\u2019s look at our records as well as our rhetoric. That\u2019s really part of your mistrust here. And now I suggest that maybe you go to some of these organizations that are the watchdogs of what we do, like the Citizens Against Government Waste or the National Taxpayers Union or these other organizations that watch us all the time. I don\u2019t expect you to watch every vote. And you know what you\u2019ll find? This is the most liberal big-spending record in the United States Senate. I have fought against excessive spending and outrages. I have fought to reduce the earmarks and eliminate them. Do you know that Senator Obama has voted for \u2014 is proposing $860 billion of new spending now? New spending. Do you know that he voted for every increase in spending that I saw come across the floor of the United States Senate while we were working to eliminate these pork barrel earmarks? He voted for nearly a billion dollars in pork barrel earmark projects, including, by the way, $3 million for an overhead projector at a planetarium in Chicago, Illinois. My friends, do we need to spend that kind of money? I think you have to look at my record and you have to look at his. Then you have to look at our proposals for our economy, not $860 billion in new spending, but for the kinds of reforms that keep people in their jobs, get middle-income Americans working again, and getting our economy moving again. You\u2019re going to be examining our proposals tonight and in the future, and energy independence is a way to do that, is one of them. And drilling offshore and nuclear power are two vital elements of that. And I\u2019ve been supporting those and I know how to fix this economy, and eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, and stop sending $700 billion a year overseas."}

We\u2019re going to have to sit down across the table, Republican and Democrat, as we did in 1983 between Ronald Reagan and Tip O\u2019Neill. I know how to do that. I have a clear record of reaching across the aisle, whether it be Joe Lieberman or Russ Feingold or Ted Kennedy or others. That\u2019s my clear record. We can work on nuclear power plants. Build a whole bunch of them, create millions of new jobs. We have to have all of the above, alternative fuels, wind, tide, solar, natural gas, clean coal technology. All of these things we can do as Americans and we can take on this mission and we can overcome it. My friends, some of this $700 billion ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations. As far as health care is concerned, obviously, everyone is struggling to make sure that they can afford their premiums and that they can have affordable and available health care. That\u2019s the next issue. But we can do them all at once. There\u2019s no \u2014 and we have to do them all at once. All three you mentioned are compelling national security requirements."}

Now, I\u2019ve listed the things that I think have to be at the top of the list. Energy we have to deal with today, because you\u2019re paying $3.80 here in Nashville for gasoline, and it could go up. And it\u2019s a strain on your family budget, but it\u2019s also bad for our national security, because countries like Russia and Venezuela and, you know, in some cases, countries like Iran, are benefiting from higher oil prices. So we\u2019ve got to deal with that right away. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve called for an investment of $15 billion a year over 10 years. Our goal should be, in 10 year\u2019s time, we are free of dependence on Middle Eastern oil. And we can do it. Now, when JFK said we\u2019re going to the Moon in 10 years, nobody was sure how to do it, but we understood that, if the American people make a decision to do something, it gets done. So that would be priority number one. Health care is priority number two, because that broken health care system is bad not only for families, but it\u2019s making our businesses less competitive. And, number three, we\u2019ve got to deal with education so that our young people are competitive in a global economy. But just one point I want to make, Tom. Senator McCain mentioned looking at our records. We do need to look at our records. Senator McCain likes to talk about earmarks a lot. And that\u2019s important. I want to go line by line through every item in the federal budget and eliminate programs that don\u2019t work and make sure that those that do work, work better and cheaper. But understand this - We also have to look at where some of our tax revenues are going. So when Senator McCain proposes a $300 billion tax cut, a continuation not only of the Bush tax cuts, but an additional $200 billion that he\u2019s going to give to big corporations, including big oil companies, $4 billion worth, that\u2019s money out of the system. And so we\u2019ve got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that they\u2019re working for you. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do as president of the United States."}

I first proposed a long time ago that we would have to examine every agency and every bureaucracy of government. And we\u2019re going to have to eliminate those that aren\u2019t working. I know a lot of them that aren\u2019t working. One of them is in defense spending, because I\u2019ve taken on some of the defense contractors. I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion in a deal for an Air Force tanker that was done in a corrupt fashion. I believe that we have to eliminate the earmarks. And sometimes those projects, not \u2014 not the overhead projector that Senator Obama asked for, but some of them that are really good projects, will have \u2014 will have to be eliminated, as well. And they\u2019ll have to undergo the same scrutiny that all projects should in competition with others. So we\u2019re going to have to tell the American people that spending is going to have to be cut in America. And I recommend a spending freeze that \u2014 except for defense, Veterans Affairs, and some other vital programs, we\u2019ll just have to have across-the-board freeze. And some of those programs may not grow as much as we would like for them to, but we can establish priorities with full transparency, with full knowledge of the American people, and full consultation, not done behind closed doors and shoving earmarks in the middle of the night into programs that we don\u2019t even \u2014 sometimes we don\u2019t even know about until months later. And, by the way, I want to go back a second. Look, we can attack health care and energy at the same time. We\u2019re not \u2014 we\u2019re not \u2014 we\u2019re not rifle shots here. We are Americans. We can, with the participation of all Americans, work together and solve these problems together. Frankly, I\u2019m not going to tell that person without health insurance that, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you\u2019ll have to wait.\u201d I\u2019m going to tell you Americans we\u2019ll get to work right away and we\u2019ll get to work together, and we can get them all done, because that\u2019s what America has been doing."}

And President Bush did some smart things at the outset, but one of the opportunities that was missed was, when he spoke to the American people, he said, \u201cGo out and shop.\u201d That wasn\u2019t the kind of call to service that I think the American people were looking for. And so it\u2019s important to understand that the \u2014 I think the American people are hungry for the kind of leadership that is going to tackle these problems not just in government, but outside of government. And let\u2019s take the example of energy, which we already spoke about. There is going to be the need for each and every one of us to start thinking about how we use energy. I believe in the need for increased oil production. We\u2019re going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling. It includes telling the oil companies, that currently have 68 million acres that they\u2019re not using, that either you use them or you lose them. We\u2019re going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy. But each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes, in our buildings. And one of the things I want to do is make sure that we\u2019re providing incentives so that you can buy a fuel efficient car that\u2019s made right here in the United States of America, not in Japan or South Korea, making sure that you are able to weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient. And that\u2019s going to require effort from each and every one of us. And the last point I just want to make. I think the young people of America are especially interested in how they can serve, and that\u2019s one of the reasons why I\u2019m interested in doubling the Peace Corps, making sure that we are creating a volunteer corps all across this country that can be involved in their community, involved in military service, so that military families and our troops are not the only ones bearing the burden of renewing America. That\u2019s something that all of us have to be involved with and that requires some leadership from Washington."}

My friends, the last president to raise taxes during tough economic times was Herbert Hoover, and he practiced protectionism as well, which I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get to at some point. You know, last year up to this time, we\u2019ve lost 700,000 jobs in America. The only bright spot is that over 300,000 jobs have been created by small businesses. Senator Obama\u2019s secret that you don\u2019t know is that his tax increases will increase taxes on 50 percent of small business revenue. Small businesses across America will have to cut jobs and will have their taxes increase and won\u2019t be able to hire because of Senator Obama\u2019s tax policies. You know, he said some time ago, he said he would forgo his tax increases if the economy was bad. I\u2019ve got some news, Senator Obama, the news is bad. So let\u2019s not raise anybody\u2019s taxes, my friends, and make it be very clear to you I am not in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy. I am in favor of leaving the tax rates alone and reducing the tax burden on middle-income Americans by doubling your tax exemption for every child from $3,500 to $7,000.

I saw it done with our \u2014 our wonderful Ronald Reagan, a conservative from California, and the liberal Democrat Tip O\u2019Neill from Massachusetts. That\u2019s what we need more of, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done in Washington. Senator Obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue. I\u2019ve taken them on. I\u2019m not too popular sometimes with my own party, much less his. So Medicare, it\u2019s going to be a little tougher. It\u2019s going to be a little tougher because we\u2019re talking about very complex and difficult issues. My friends, what we have to do with Medicare is have a commission, have the smartest people in America come together, come up with recommendations, and then, like the base-closing commission idea we had, then we should have Congress vote up or down. Let\u2019s not let them fool with it anymore. There\u2019s too much special interests and too many lobbyists working there.

Senator Obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts. That\u2019s his record. When he ran for the United States Senate from Illinois, he said he would have a middle-income tax cut. You know he came to the Senate and never once proposed legislation to do that?

I traveled all over the world looking at the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, Joe Lieberman and I. And I introduced the first legislation, and we forced votes on it. That\u2019s the good news, my friends. The bad news is we lost. But we kept the debate going, and we kept this issue to \u2014 to posing to Americans the danger that climate change opposes. Now, how \u2014 what\u2019s \u2014 what\u2019s the best way of fixing it? Nuclear power. Senator Obama says that it has to be safe or disposable or something like that. Look, I \u2014 I was on Navy ships that had nuclear power plants. Nuclear power is safe, and it\u2019s clean, and it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs. And \u2014 and I know that we can reprocess the spent nuclear fuel. The Japanese, the British, the French do it. And we can do it, too. Senator Obama has opposed that. We can move forward, and clean up our climate, and develop green technologies, and alternate \u2014 alternative energies for \u2014 for hybrid, for hydrogen, for battery-powered cars, so that we can clean up our environment and at the same time get our economy going by creating millions of jobs.

And it is absolutely critical that we understand this is not just a challenge, it\u2019s an opportunity, because if we create a new energy economy, we can create five million new jobs, easily, here in the United States. It can be an engine that drives us into the future the same way the computer was the engine for economic growth over the last couple of decades. And we can do it, but we\u2019re going to have to make an investment. The same way the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out, for defense purposes, how to communicate, we\u2019ve got to understand that this is a national security issue, as well. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to make some investments and I\u2019ve called for investments in solar, wind, geothermal. Contrary to what Senator McCain keeps on saying, I favor nuclear power as one component of our overall energy mix. But this is another example where I think it is important to look at the record. Senator McCain and I actually agree on something. He said a while back that the big problem with energy is that for 30 years, politicians in Washington haven\u2019t done anything. What Senator McCain doesn\u2019t mention is he\u2019s been there 26 of them. And during that time, he voted 23 times against alternative fuels, 23 times. So it\u2019s easy to talk about this stuff during a campaign, but it\u2019s important for us to understand that it requires a sustained effort from the next president. One last point I want to make on energy. Senator McCain talks a lot about drilling, and that\u2019s important, but we have three percent of the world\u2019s oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world\u2019s oil. So what that means is that we can\u2019t simply drill our way out of the problem. And we\u2019re not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global warming. We\u2019re going to have to come up with alternatives, and that means that the United States government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like China that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week. We\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re giving them the energy that they need or helping them to create the energy that they need."}

I think once it gets into productive stages, that we ought to, obviously, turn it over to the private sector. By the way, my friends, I know you grow a little weary with this back-and-forth. It was an energy bill on the floor of the Senate loaded down with goodies, billions for the oil companies, and it was sponsored by Bush and Cheney. You know who voted for it? You might never know. That one. You know who voted against it? Me. I have fought time after time against these pork barrel \u2014 these bills that come to the floor and they have all kinds of goodies and all kinds of things in them for everybody and they buy off the votes. I vote against them, my friends. I vote against them. But the point is, also, on oil drilling, oil drilling offshore now is vital so that we can bridge the gap. We can bridge the gap between imported oil, which is a national security issue, as well as any other, and it will reduce the price of a barrel of oil, because when people know there\u2019s a greater supply, then the cost of that will go down. That\u2019s fundamental economics. We\u2019ve got to drill offshore, my friends, and we\u2019ve got to do it now, and we can do it. And as far as nuclear power is concerned, again, look at the record. Senator Obama has approved storage and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. And I\u2019ll stop, Tom, and you didn\u2019t even wave.

It is breaking family budgets. I can\u2019t tell you how many people I meet who don\u2019t have health insurance. If you\u2019ve got health insurance, most of you have seen your premiums double over the last eight years. And your co-payments and deductibles have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alone. If you\u2019re a small business, it\u2019s a crushing burden. So one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing. So here\u2019s what I would do. If you\u2019ve got health care already, and probably the majority of you do, then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it. You can keep your choice of doctor. We\u2019re going to work with your employer to lower the cost of your premiums by up to $2,500 a year. And we\u2019re going to do it by investing in prevention. We\u2019re going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital. That will reduce medical errors and reduce costs. If you don\u2019t have health insurance, you\u2019re going to be able to buy the same kind of insurance that Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees. Because there\u2019s a huge pool, we can drop the costs. And nobody will be excluded for pre-existing conditions, which is a huge problem. Now, Senator McCain has a different kind of approach. He says that he\u2019s going to give you a $5,000 tax credit. What he doesn\u2019t tell you is that he is going to tax your employer-based health care benefits for the first time ever. So what one hand giveth, the other hand taketh away. He would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure you\u2019re not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered. And that is fundamentally the wrong way to go. In fact, just today business organizations like the United States Chamber of Commerce, which generally are pretty supportive of Republicans, said that this would lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system. That, I don\u2019t think, is the kind of change that we need. We\u2019ve got to have somebody who is fighting for patients and making sure that you get decent, affordable health care. And that\u2019s something that I\u2019m committed to doing as president."}

In a country as wealthy as ours, for us to have people who are going bankrupt because they can\u2019t pay their medical bills \u2014 for my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because they\u2019re saying that this may be a pre-existing condition and they don\u2019t have to pay her treatment, there\u2019s something fundamentally wrong about that. So let me \u2014 let me just talk about this fundamental difference. And, Tom, I know that we\u2019re under time constraints, but Senator McCain through a lot of stuff out there. Number one, let me just repeat, if you\u2019ve got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it. All I\u2019m going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it. You\u2019ll still have choice of doctor. There\u2019s no mandate involved. Small businesses are not going to have a mandate. What we\u2019re going to give you is a 50 percent tax credit to help provide health care for those that you need. Now, it\u2019s true that I say that you are going to have to make sure that your child has health care, because children are relatively cheap to insure and we don\u2019t want them going to the emergency room for treatable illnesses like asthma. And when Senator McCain says that he wants to provide children health care, what he doesn\u2019t mention is he voted against the expansion of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program that is responsible for making sure that so many children who didn\u2019t have previously health insurance have it now. Now, the final point I\u2019ll make on this whole issue of government intrusion and mandates \u2014 it is absolutely true that I think it is important for government to crack down on insurance companies that are cheating their customers, that don\u2019t give you the fine print, so you end up thinking that you\u2019re paying for something and, when you finally get sick and you need it, you\u2019re not getting it. And the reason that it\u2019s a problem to go shopping state by state, you know what insurance companies will do? They will find a state \u2014 maybe Arizona, maybe another state \u2014 where there are no requirements for you to get cancer screenings, where there are no requirements for you to have to get pre-existing conditions, and they will all set up shop there. That\u2019s how in banking it works. Everybody goes to Delaware, because they\u2019ve got very \u2014 pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards. And in that situation, what happens is, is that the protections you have, the consumer protections that you need, you\u2019re not going to have available to you. That is a fundamental difference that I have with Senator McCain. He believes in deregulation in every circumstance. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been going through for the last eight years. It hasn\u2019t worked, and we need fundamental change."}

And that is one of the challenges that America faces. But having said that, America \u2014 and we\u2019ll hear a lot of criticism. I\u2019ve heard a lot of criticism about America, and our national security policy, and all that, and much of that criticism is justified. But the fact is, America is the greatest force for good in the history of the world. My friends, we have gone to all four corners of the Earth and shed American blood in defense, usually, of somebody else\u2019s freedom and our own. So we are peacemakers and we\u2019re peacekeepers. But the challenge is to know when the United States of American can beneficially effect the outcome of a crisis, when to go in and when not, when American military power is worth the expenditure of our most precious treasure. And that question can only be answered by someone with the knowledge and experience and the judgment, the judgment to know when our national security is not only at risk, but where the United States of America can make a difference in preventing genocide, in preventing the spread of terrorism, in doing the things that the United States has done, not always well, but we\u2019ve done because we\u2019re a nation of good. And I am convinced that my record, going back to my opposition from sending the Marines to Lebanon, to supporting our efforts in Kosovo and Bosnia and the first Gulf War, and my judgment, I think, is something that I\u2019m \u2014 a record that I\u2019m willing to stand on. Senator Obama was wrong about Iraq and the surge. He was wrong about Russia when they committed aggression against Georgia. And in his short career, he does not understand our national security challenges. We don\u2019t have time for on-the-job training, my friends."}

It\u2019s true. There are some things I don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9\/11, while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us. That was Senator McCain\u2019s judgment and it was the wrong judgment. When Senator McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq, he suggested it was going to be quick and easy, we\u2019d be greeted as liberators. That was the wrong judgment, and it\u2019s been costly to us. So one of the difficulties with Iraq is that it has put an enormous strain, first of all, on our troops, obviously, and they have performed heroically and honorably and we owe them an extraordinary debt of gratitude. But it\u2019s also put an enormous strain on our budget. We\u2019ve spent, so far, close to $700 billion and if we continue on the path that we\u2019re on, as Senator McCain is suggesting, it\u2019s going to go well over $1 trillion. We\u2019re spending $10 billion a month in Iraq at a time when the Iraqis have a $79 billion surplus, $79 billion. And we need that $10 billion a month here in the United States to put people back to work, to do all these wonderful things that Senator McCain suggested we should be doing, but has not yet explained how he would pay for. Now, Senator McCain and I do agree, this is the greatest nation on earth. We are a force of good in the world. But there has never been a nation in the history of the world that saw its economy decline and maintained its military superiority. And the strains that have been placed on our alliances around the world and the respect that\u2019s been diminished over the last eight years has constrained us being able to act on something like the genocide in Darfur, because we don\u2019t have the resources or the allies to do everything that we should be doing. That\u2019s going to change when I\u2019m president, but we can\u2019t change it unless we fundamentally change Senator McCain\u2019s and George Bush\u2019s foreign policy. It has not worked for America."}

If we had done what Senator Obama wanted done in Iraq, and that was set a date for withdrawal, which General Petraeus, our chief \u2014 chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff said would be a very dangerous course to take for America, then we would have had a wider war, we would have been back, Iranian influence would have increased, al Qaeda would have re- established a base. There was a lot at stake there, my friends. And I can tell you right now that Senator Obama would have brought our troops home in defeat. I\u2019ll bring them home with victory and with honor and that is a fundamental difference. The United States of America, Tom, is the greatest force for good, as I said. And we must do whatever we can to prevent genocide, whatever we can to prevent these terrible calamities that we have said never again. But it also has to be tempered with our ability to beneficially affect the situation. That requires a cool hand at the tiller. This requires a person who understands what our \u2014 the limits of our capability are. We went in to Somalia as a peacemaking organization, we ended up trying to be \u2014 excuse me, as a peacekeeping organization, we ended up trying to be peacemakers and we ended up having to withdraw in humiliation. In Lebanon, I stood up to President Reagan, my hero, and said, if we send Marines in there, how can we possibly beneficially affect this situation? And said we shouldn\u2019t. Unfortunately, almost 300 brave young Marines were killed. So you have to temper your decisions with the ability to beneficially affect the situation and realize you\u2019re sending America\u2019s most precious asset, American blood, into harm\u2019s way. And, again, I know those situations. I\u2019ve been in them all my life. And I can tell you right now the security of your young men and women who are serving in the military are my first priority right after our nation\u2019s security. And I may have to make those tough decisions. But I won\u2019t take them lightly. And I understand that we have to say never again to a Holocaust and never again to Rwanda. But we had also better be darn sure we don\u2019t leave and make the situation worse, thereby exacerbating our reputation and our ability to address crises in other parts of the world."}

I believe that part of the reason we have a difficult situation is because we made a bad judgment going into Iraq in the first place when we hadn\u2019t finished the job of hunting down bin Laden and crushing al Qaeda. So what happened was we got distracted, we diverted resources, and ultimately bin Laden escaped, set up base camps in the mountains of Pakistan in the northwest provinces there. They are now raiding our troops in Afghanistan, destabilizing the situation. They\u2019re stronger now than at any time since 2001. And that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s so important for us to reverse course, because that\u2019s the central front on terrorism. They are plotting to kill Americans right now. As Secretary Gates, the defense secretary, said, the war against terrorism began in that region and that\u2019s where it will end. So part of the reason I think it\u2019s so important for us to end the war in Iraq is to be able to get more troops into Afghanistan, put more pressure on the Afghan government to do what it needs to do, eliminate some of the drug trafficking that\u2019s funding terrorism. But I do believe that we have to change our policies with Pakistan. We can\u2019t coddle, as we did, a dictator, give him billions of dollars and then he\u2019s making peace treaties with the Taliban and militants. What I\u2019ve said is we\u2019re going to encourage democracy in Pakistan, expand our nonmilitary aid to Pakistan so that they have more of a stake in working with us, but insisting that they go after these militants. And if we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then I think that we have to act and we will take them out. We will kill bin Laden; we will crush Al Qaida. That has to be our biggest national security priority."}

You know, my hero is a guy named Teddy Roosevelt. Teddy Roosevelt used to say walk softly \u2014 talk softly, but carry a big stick. Senator Obama likes to talk loudly. In fact, he said he wants to announce that he\u2019s going to attack Pakistan. Remarkable. You know, if you are a country and you\u2019re trying to gain the support of another country, then you want to do everything you can that they would act in a cooperative fashion. When you announce that you\u2019re going to launch an attack into another country, it\u2019s pretty obvious that you have the effect that it had in Pakistan: It turns public opinion against us. Now, let me just go back with you very briefly. We drove the Russians out with \u2014 the Afghan freedom fighters drove the Russians out of Afghanistan, and then we made a most serious mistake. We washed our hands of Afghanistan. The Taliban came back in, Al Qaida, we then had the situation that required us to conduct the Afghan war. Now, our relations with Pakistan are critical, because the border areas are being used as safe havens by the Taliban and Al Qaida and other extremist organizations, and we have to get their support. Now, General Petraeus had a strategy, the same strategy \u2014 very, very different, because of the conditions and the situation \u2014 but the same fundamental strategy that succeeded in Iraq. And that is to get the support of the people. We need to help the Pakistani government go into Waziristan, where I visited, a very rough country, and \u2014 and get the support of the people, and get them to work with us and turn against the cruel Taliban and others. And by working and coordinating our efforts together, not threatening to attack them, but working with them, and where necessary use force, but talk softly, but carry a big stick."}

We have to double the size of the Afghan army. We have to have a streamlined NATO command structure. We have to do a lot of things. We have to work much more closely with the Pakistanis. But most importantly, we have to have the same strategy, which Senator Obama said wouldn\u2019t work, couldn\u2019t work, still fails to admit that he was wrong about Iraq. He still will not admit that he was wrong about the strategy of the surge in Iraq, and that\u2019s the same kind of strategy of go out and secure and hold and allow people to live normal lives.

And for the most part I agree with Senator McCain on many of the steps that have to be taken. But we can\u2019t just provide moral support. We\u2019ve got to provide moral support to the Poles and Estonia and Latvia and all of the nations that were former Soviet satellites. But we\u2019ve also got to provide them with financial and concrete assistance to help rebuild their economies. Georgia in particular is now on the brink of enormous economic challenges. And some say that that\u2019s what Putin intended in the first place. The other thing we have to do, though, is we\u2019ve got to see around the corners. We\u2019ve got to anticipate some of these problems ahead of time. You know, back in April, I put out a statement saying that the situation in Georgia was unsustainable because you had Russian peacekeepers in these territories that were under dispute. And you knew that if the Russians themselves were trying to obtain some of these territories or push back against Georgia, that that was not a stable situation. So part of the job of the next commander-in-chief, in keeping all of you safe, is making sure that we can see some of the 21st Century challenges and anticipate them before they happen. We haven\u2019t been doing enough of that. We tend to be reactive. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing over the last eight years and that has actually made us more safe. That\u2019s part of what happened in Afghanistan, where we rushed into Iraq and Senator McCain and President Bush suggested that it wasn\u2019t that important to catch bin Laden right now and that we could muddle through, and that has cost us dearly. We\u2019ve got to be much more strategic if we\u2019re going to be able to deal with all of the challenges that we face out there. And one last point I want to make about Russia. Energy is going to be key in dealing with Russia. If we can reduce our energy consumption, that reduces the amount of petro dollars that they have to make mischief around the world. That will strengthen us and weaken them when it comes to issues like Georgia."}

We cannot allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon. It would be a game-changer in the region. Not only would it threaten Israel, our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world, but it would also create a possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists. And so it\u2019s unacceptable. And I will do everything that\u2019s required to prevent it. And we will never take military options off the table. And it is important that we don\u2019t provide veto power to the United Nations or anyone else in acting in our interests. It is important, though, for us to use all the tools at our disposal to prevent the scenario where we\u2019ve got to make those kinds of choices. And that\u2019s why I have consistently said that, if we can work more effectively with other countries diplomatically to tighten sanctions on Iran, if we can reduce our energy consumption through alternative energy, so that Iran has less money, if we can impose the kinds of sanctions that, say, for example, Iran right now imports gasoline, even though it\u2019s an oil-producer, because its oil infrastructure has broken down, if we can prevent them from importing the gasoline that they need and the refined petroleum products, that starts changing their cost-benefit analysis. That starts putting the squeeze on them. Now, it is true, though, that I believe that we should have direct talks \u2014 not just with our friends, but also with our enemies \u2014 to deliver a tough, direct message to Iran that, if you don\u2019t change your behavior, then there will be dire consequences. If you do change your behavior, then it is possible for you to re-join the community of nations. Now, it may not work. But one of the things we\u2019ve learned is, is that when we take that approach, whether it\u2019s in North Korea or in Iran, then we have a better chance at better outcomes. When President Bush decided we\u2019re not going to talk to Iran, we\u2019re not going to talk to North Korea, you know what happened? Iran went from zero centrifuges to develop nuclear weapons to 4,000. North Korea quadrupled its nuclear capability. We\u2019ve got to try to have talks, understanding that we\u2019re not taking military options off the table."}

Americans are hurting right now, and they\u2019re angry. They\u2019re hurting, and they\u2019re angry. They\u2019re innocent victims of greed and excess on Wall Street and as well as Washington, D.C. And they\u2019re angry, and they have every reason to be angry. And they want this country to go in a new direction. And there are elements of my proposal that you just outlined which I won\u2019t repeat. But we also have to have a short-term fix, in my view, and long- term fixes. Let me just talk to you about one of the short-term fixes. The catalyst for this housing crisis was the Fannie and Freddie Mae that caused subprime lending situation that now caused the housing market in America to collapse. I am convinced that, until we reverse this continued decline in home ownership and put a floor under it, and so that people have not only the hope and belief they can stay in their homes and realize the American dream, but that value will come up. Now, we have allocated $750 billion. Let\u2019s take 300 of that billion and go in and buy those home loan mortgages and negotiate with those people in their homes, 11 million homes or more, so that they can afford to pay the mortgage, stay in their home. Now, I know the criticism of this. Well, what about the citizen that stayed in their homes? That paid their mortgage payments? It doesn\u2019t help that person in their home if the next door neighbor\u2019s house is abandoned. And so we\u2019ve got to reverse this. We ought to put the homeowners first. And I am disappointed that Secretary Paulson and others have not made that their first priority."}

I think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And the financial rescue plan that Senator McCain and I supported is an important first step. And I pushed for some core principles - making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they\u2019re putting money up. Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process. And I think that it\u2019s going to take some time to work itself out. But what we haven\u2019t yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class. Because the fundamentals of the economy were weak even before this latest crisis. So I\u2019ve proposed four specific things that I think can help. Number one, let\u2019s focus on jobs. I want to end the tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and provide a tax credit for every company that\u2019s creating a job right here in America. Number two, let\u2019s help families right away by providing them a tax cut \u2014 a middle-class tax cut for people making less than $200,000, and let\u2019s allow them to access their IRA accounts without penalty if they\u2019re experiencing a crisis. Now Senator McCain and I agree with your idea that we\u2019ve got to help homeowners. That\u2019s why we included in the financial package a proposal to get homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate their mortgages. I disagree with Senator McCain in how to do it, because the way Senator McCain has designed his plan, it could be a giveaway to banks if we\u2019re buying full price for mortgages that now are worth a lot less. And we don\u2019t want to waste taxpayer money. And we\u2019ve got to get the financial package working much quicker than it has been working. Last point I want to make, though. We\u2019ve got some long-term challenges in this economy that have to be dealt with. We\u2019ve got to fix our energy policy that\u2019s giving our wealth away. We\u2019ve got to fix our health care system and we\u2019ve got to invest in our education system for every young person to be able to learn."}

Let me tell you what I\u2019m actually going to do. I think tax policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself. And we both want to cut taxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes for. Now, Senator McCain, the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in America. Exxon Mobil, and other oil companies, for example, would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks. What I\u2019ve said is I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of working Americans, 95 percent. If you make more \u2014 if you make less than a quarter million dollars a year, then you will not see your income tax go up, your capital gains tax go up, your payroll tax. Not one dime. And 95 percent of working families, 95 percent of you out there, will get a tax cut. In fact, independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than Senator McCain does. Now, the conversation I had with Joe the plumber, what I essentially said to him was, \u201cFive years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then.\u201d And what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who doesn\u2019t yet have money, I want to give them a tax break now. And that requires us to make some important choices. The last point I\u2019ll make about small businesses. Not only do 98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000, but I also want to give them additional tax breaks, because they are the drivers of the economy. They produce the most jobs."}

So let me get to that. What I want to emphasize, though, is that I have been a strong proponent of pay-as- you-go. Every dollar that I\u2019ve proposed, I\u2019ve proposed an additional cut so that it matches. And some of the cuts, just to give you an example, we spend $15 billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies. It doesn\u2019t \u2014 under the Medicare plan \u2014 it doesn\u2019t help seniors get any better. It\u2019s not improving our health care system. It\u2019s just a giveaway. We need to eliminate a whole host of programs that don\u2019t work. And I want to go through the federal budget line by line, page by page, programs that don\u2019t work, we should cut. Programs that we need, we should make them work better. Now, what is true is that Senator McCain and I have a difference in terms of the need to invest in America and the American people. I mentioned health care earlier. If we make investments now so that people have coverage, that we are preventing diseases, that will save on Medicare and Medicaid in the future. If we invest in a serious energy policy, that will save in the amount of money we\u2019re borrowing from China to send to Saudi Arabia. If we invest now in our young people and their ability to go to college, that will allow them to drive this economy into the 21st century. But what is absolutely true is that, once we get through this economic crisis and some of the specific proposals to get us out of this slump, that we\u2019re not going to be able to go back to our profligate ways. And we\u2019re going to have to embrace a culture and an ethic of responsibility, all of us, corporations, the federal government, and individuals out there who may be living beyond their means."}

And, by the way, this was a proposal made by Senator Clinton not too long ago. So, obviously, if we can start increasing home values, then there will be creation of wealth."}

Whether it be opposition to spending and earmarks, whether it be the issue of torture, whether it be the conduct of the war in Iraq, which I vigorously opposed. Whether it be on fighting the pharmaceutical companies on Medicare prescription drugs, importation. Whether it be fighting for an HMO patient\u2019s bill of rights. Whether it be the establishment of the 9\/11 Commission. I have a long record of reform and fighting through on the floor of the United States Senate."}

What the American people can\u2019t afford, though, is four more years of failed economic policies. And what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about what\u2019s most pressing to them: the economic crisis. Senator McCain\u2019s own campaign said publicly last week that, if we keep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to change the subject. And I would love to see the next three weeks devoted to talking about the economy, devoted to talking about health care, devoted to talking about energy, and figuring out how the American people can send their kids to college. And that is something that I would welcome. But it requires, I think, a recognition that politics as usual, as been practiced over the last several years, is not solving the big problems here in America."}

Joe has always made sure that he is fighting on behalf of working families, and I think he shares my core values and my sense of where the country needs to go. Because after eight years of failed policies, he and I both agree that what we\u2019re going to have to do is to reprioritize, make sure that we\u2019re investing in the American people, give tax cuts not to the wealthiest corporations, but give them to small businesses and give them to individuals who are struggling right now, make sure that we finally get serious about energy independence, something that has been languishing in Washington for 30 years, and make sure that our kids get a great education and can afford to go to college. So, on the key issues that are of importance to American families, Joe Biden\u2019s always been on the right side, and I think he will make an outstanding president if, heaven forbid, something happened to me."}

We can eliminate our dependence on foreign oil by building 45 new nuclear plants, power plants, right away. We can store and we can reprocess. Senator Obama will tell you, in the \u2014 as the extreme environmentalists do, it has to be safe. Look, we\u2019ve sailed Navy ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them. We can store and reprocess spent nuclear fuel, Senator Obama, no problem. So the point is with nuclear power, with wind, tide, solar, natural gas, with development of flex fuel, hybrid, clean coal technology, clean coal technology is key in the heartland of America that\u2019s hurting rather badly.

I think that\u2019s about a realistic timeframe. And this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face. Obviously, we\u2019ve got an immediate crisis right now. But nothing is more important than us no longer borrowing $700 billion or more from China and sending it to Saudi Arabia. It\u2019s mortgaging our children\u2019s future. Now, from the start of this campaign, I\u2019ve identified this as one of my top priorities and here is what I think we have to do. Number one, we do need to expand domestic production and that means, for example, telling the oil companies the 68 million acres that they currently have leased that they\u2019re not drilling, use them or lose them. And I think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil. But understand, we only have three to four percent of the world\u2019s oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world\u2019s oil, which means that we can\u2019t drill our way out of the problem. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve focused on putting resources into solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal. These have been priorities of mine since I got to the Senate, and it is absolutely critical that we develop a high fuel efficient car that\u2019s built not in Japan and not in South Korea, but built here in the United States of America. We invented the auto industry and the fact that we have fallen so far behind is something that we have to work on. Now I just want to make one last point because Senator McCain mentioned NAFTA and the issue of trade and that actually bears on this issue. I believe in free trade. But I also believe that for far too long, certainly during the course of the Bush administration with the support of Senator McCain, the attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement. And NAFTA doesn\u2019t have \u2014 did not have enforceable labor agreements and environmental agreements. And what I said was we should include those and make them enforceable. In the same way that we should enforce rules against China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper. And when it comes to South Korea, we\u2019ve got a trade agreement up right now, they are sending hundreds of thousands of South Korean cars into the United States. That\u2019s all good. We can only get 4,000 to 5,000 into South Korea. That is not free trade. We\u2019ve got to have a president who is going to be advocating on behalf of American businesses and American workers and I make no apology for that."}

We will reduce the cost of a barrel of oil because we show the world that we have a supply of our own. It\u2019s doable. The technology is there and we have to drill now. Now, on the subject of free trade agreements. I am a free trader. And I need \u2014 we need to have education and training programs for displaced workers that work, going to our community colleges. But let me give you another example of a free trade agreement that Senator Obama opposes. Right now, because of previous agreements, some made by President Clinton, the goods and products that we send to Colombia, which is our largest agricultural importer of our products, is \u2014 there\u2019s a billion dollars that we \u2014 our businesses have paid so far in order to get our goods in there. Because of previous agreements, their goods and products come into our country for free. So Senator Obama, who has never traveled south of our border, opposes the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. The same country that\u2019s helping us try to stop the flow of drugs into our country that\u2019s killing young Americans. And also the country that just freed three Americans that will help us create jobs in America because they will be a market for our goods and products without having to pay \u2014 without us having to pay the billions of dollars \u2014 the billion dollars and more that we\u2019ve already paid.

Actually, I understand it pretty well. The history in Colombia right now is that labor leaders have been targeted for assassination on a fairly consistent basis and there have not been prosecutions. And what I have said, because the free trade \u2014 the trade agreement itself does have labor and environmental protections, but we have to stand for human rights and we have to make sure that violence isn\u2019t being perpetrated against workers who are just trying to organize for their rights, which is why, for example, I supported the Peruvian Free Trade Agreement which was a well-structured agreement. But I think that the important point is we\u2019ve got to have a president who understands the benefits of free trade but also is going to enforce unfair trade agreements and is going to stand up to other countries. And the last point I\u2019ll make, because we started on energy. When I talked about the automakers, they are obviously getting hammered right now. They were already having a tough time because of high gas prices. And now with the financial crisis, car dealerships are closing and people can\u2019t get car loans. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s important for us to get loan guarantees to the automakers, but we do have to hold them responsible as well to start producing the highly fuel-efficient cars of the future. And Detroit had dragged its feet too long in terms of getting that done. It\u2019s going to be one of my highest priorities because transportation accounts for about 30 percent of our total energy consumption. If we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs all across America, including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century."}

Free trade between ourselves and Colombia, I just recited to you the benefits of concluding that agreement, a billion dollars of American dollars that could have gone to creating jobs and businesses in the United States, opening up those markets. So I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that Senator Obama wants to restrict trade and he wants to raise taxes.

Look, as I travel around the country, this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again. Just yesterday, I was in Toledo shaking some hands in a line. Two women, both of them probably in their mid- to late-50s, had just been laid off of their plant. Neither of them have health insurance. And they were desperate for some way of getting coverage, because, understandably, they\u2019re worried that, if they get sick, they could go bankrupt. So here\u2019s what my plan does. If you have health insurance, then you don\u2019t have to do anything. If you\u2019ve got health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan. The only thing we\u2019re going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you. And we estimate we can cut the average family\u2019s premium by about $2,500 per year. If you don\u2019t have health insurance, then what we\u2019re going to do is to provide you the option of buying into the same kind of federal pool that both Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees, which will give you high-quality care, choice of doctors, at lower costs, because so many people are part of this insured group. We\u2019re going to make sure that insurance companies can\u2019t discriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions. We\u2019ll negotiate with the drug companies for the cheapest available price on drugs. We are going to invest in information technology to eliminate bureaucracy and make the system more efficient. And we are going to make sure that we manage chronic illnesses, like diabetes and heart disease, that cost a huge amount, but could be prevented. We\u2019ve got to put more money into preventive care. This will cost some money on the front end, but over the long term this is the only way that not only are we going to make families healthy, but it\u2019s also how we\u2019re going to save the federal budget, because we can\u2019t afford these escalating costs."}

We need to put health care records online. The V.A. does that. That will \u2014 that will reduce costs. We need to have more community health centers. We need to have walk-in clinics.

Now, Joe, Senator Obama\u2019s plan, if you\u2019re a small business and you are able \u2014 and your \u2014 the guy that sells to you will not have his capital gains tax increase, which Senator Obama wants, if you\u2019re out there, my friend, and you\u2019ve got employees, and you\u2019ve got kids, if you don\u2019t get \u2014 adopt the health care plan that Senator Obama mandates, he\u2019s going to fine you. Now, Senator Obama, I\u2019d like \u2014 still like to know what that fine is going to be, and I don\u2019t think that Joe right now wants to pay a fine when he is seeing such difficult times in America\u2019s economy. Senator Obama wants to set up health care bureaucracies, take over the health care of America through \u2014 as he said, his object is a single payer system.

And it is true that this is going to be, I think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president. It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance. Now I would not provide a litmus test. But I am somebody who believes that Roe versus Wade was rightly decided. I think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that I think good people on both sides can disagree on. But what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision. And I think that the Constitution has a right to privacy in it that shouldn\u2019t be subject to state referendum, any more than our First Amendment rights are subject to state referendum, any more than many of the other rights that we have should be subject to popular vote. So this is going to be an important issue. I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through. I\u2019ll just give you one quick example. Senator McCain and I disagreed recently when the Supreme Court made it more difficult for a woman named Lilly Ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination. For years, she had been getting paid less than a man had been paid for doing the exact same job. And when she brought a suit, saying equal pay for equal work, the judges said, well, you know, it\u2019s taken you too long to bring this lawsuit, even though she didn\u2019t know about it until fairly recently. We tried to overturn it in the Senate. I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it. I think that it\u2019s important for judges to understand that if a woman is out there trying to raise a family, trying to support her family, and is being treated unfairly, then the court has to stand up, if nobody else will. And that\u2019s the kind of judge that I want."}

If it sounds incredible that I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant, that\u2019s because it\u2019s not true. The \u2014 here are the facts. There was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade. The fact is that there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it. And the Illinois Medical Society, the organization of doctors in Illinois, voted against it. Their Hippocratic Oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books. With respect to partial-birth abortion, I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there\u2019s an exception for the mother\u2019s health and life, and this did not contain that exception. And I attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional. And that was rejected, and that\u2019s why I voted present, because I\u2019m willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception. The last point I want to make on the issue of abortion. This is an issue that \u2014 look, it divides us. And in some ways, it may be difficult to \u2014 to reconcile the two views. But there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, \u201cWe should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby.\u201d Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for the first time this year, and I think that\u2019s where we can find some common ground, because nobody\u2019s pro-abortion. I think it\u2019s always a tragic situation. We should try to reduce these circumstances."}

So we\u2019ve got to get our education system right. Now, typically, what\u2019s happened is that there\u2019s been a debate between more money or reform, and I think we need both. In some cases, we are going to have to invest. Early childhood education, which closes the achievement gap, so that every child is prepared for school, every dollar we invest in that, we end up getting huge benefits with improved reading scores, reduced dropout rates, reduced delinquency rates. I think it\u2019s going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in math and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability. And I think it\u2019s important for us to make college affordable. Right now, I meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if they\u2019re going to college, they are taking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt, and it\u2019s very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that they\u2019re going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve proposed a $4,000 tuition credit, every student, every year, in exchange for some form of community service, whether it\u2019s military service, whether it\u2019s Peace Corps, whether it\u2019s working in a community. If we do those things, then I believe that we can create a better school system. But there\u2019s one last ingredient that I just want to mention, and that\u2019s parents. We can\u2019t do it just in the schools. Parents are going to have to show more responsibility. They\u2019ve got to turn off the TV set, put away the video games, and, finally, start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need."}

There\u2019s no doubt that we have achieved equal access to schools in America after a long and difficult and terrible struggle. But what is the advantage in a low income area of sending a child to a failed school and that being your only choice? So choice and competition amongst schools is one of the key elements that\u2019s already been proven in places in like New Orleans and New York City and other places, where we have charter schools, where we take good teachers and we reward them and promote them. And we find bad teachers another line of work. And we have to be able to give parents the same choice, frankly, that Senator Obama and Mrs. Obama had and Cindy and I had to send our kids to the school \u2014 their kids to the school of their choice. Charter schools aren\u2019t the only answer, but they\u2019re providing competition. They are providing the kind of competitions that have upgraded both schools \u2014 types of schools. Now, throwing money at the problem is not the answer. You will find that some of the worst school systems in America get the most money per student. So I believe that we need to reward these good teachers. We need to encourage programs such as Teach for America and Troops to Teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which \u2014 or have the certification that some are required in some states. Look, we must improve education in this country. As far as college education is concerned, we need to make those student loans available. We need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet. We need to have full student loan program for in-state tuition. And we certainly need to adjust the certain loan eligibility to inflation."}

But I do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do. Now we tried to do this under President Bush. He put forward No Child Left Behind. Unfortunately, they left the money behind for No Child Left Behind. And local school districts end up having more of a burden, a bunch of unfunded mandates, the same kind of thing that happened with special education where we did the right thing by saying every school should provide education to kids with special needs, but we never followed through on the promise of funding, and that left local school districts very cash-strapped. So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support. Senator McCain and I actually agree on two things that he just mentioned. Charter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions. I think it\u2019s important to foster competition inside the public schools. And we also agree on the need for making sure that if we have bad teachers that they are swiftly \u2014 after given an opportunity to prove themselves, if they can\u2019t hack it, then we need to move on because our kids have to have their best future. Where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers \u2014 give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system. And I also have to disagree on Senator McCain\u2019s record when it comes to college accessibility and affordability. Recently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didn\u2019t seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was, well, you know, we can\u2019t give money to every interest group that comes along. I don\u2019t think America\u2019s youth are interest groups, I think they\u2019re our future. And this is an example of where we are going to have to prioritize. We can\u2019t say we\u2019re going to do things and then not explain in concrete terms how we\u2019re going to pay for it. And if we\u2019re going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it. It\u2019s not going to happen on its own."}

During the 1990s, we had pay-as-you-go rules. If you were going to pass something in the Congress, you had to show where you are going to pay for it and how. President Bush has taken \u2014 he\u2019s the only president in history to do this. He\u2019s also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs \u2014 1. 6 million jobs lost. He\u2019s the only president to have incomes of families go down for the last three years; the only president to see exports go down; the only president to see the lowest level of business investment in our country as it is today. Now, I\u2019m going to reverse that. I\u2019m going to change that. We\u2019re going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s. Every plan that I have laid out \u2014 my health-care plan, my plan for education, my plan for kids to be able to get better college loans \u2014 I\u2019ve shown exactly how I\u2019m going to pay for those. And we start \u2014 we don\u2019t do it exclusively \u2014 but we start by rolling back George Bush\u2019s unaffordable tax cut for the wealthiest people, people earning more than $200,000 a year, and we pass, hopefully, the McCain-Kerry Commission which identified some $60 billion that we can get. We shut the loophole which has American workers actually subsidizing the loss of their own job. They just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days - $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from China. I\u2019m going to stand up and fight for the American worker. And I am going to do it in a way that\u2019s fiscally sound. I show how I pay for the health care, how we pay for the education. I have a manufacturing jobs credit. We pay for it by shutting that loophole overseas. We raise the student loans. I pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks.

Today, if you\u2019re an American business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas. You get to defer your taxes. So if you\u2019re looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, \u201cHey, I do better overseas than I do here in America. \u201c That\u2019s not smart. I don\u2019t want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job. And when I\u2019m president, we\u2019re going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and we\u2019re going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations, 5 percent. And we\u2019re going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here. The second thing that we can do is provide a fair trade playing field. This president didn\u2019t stand up for Boeing when Airbus was violating international rules and subsidies. He discovered Boeing during the course of this campaign after I\u2019d been talking about it for months. The fact is that the president had an opportunity to stand up and take on China for currency manipulation. There are companies that wanted to petition the administration. They were told - Don\u2019t even bother; we\u2019re not going to listen to it. The fact is that there have been markets shut to us that we haven\u2019t stood up and fought for. I\u2019m going to fight for a fair trade playing field for the American worker. And I will fight for the American worker just as hard as I fight for my own job. That\u2019s what the American worker wants. And if we do that, we can have an impact. Plus, we need fiscal discipline. Restore fiscal discipline, we\u2019ll do a lot better."}

The reason I did so was because I was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage, and the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution. It has also the benefit of allowing citizens to participate in the process. After all, when you amend the Constitution, state legislatures must participate in the ratification of the Constitution. I\u2019m deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the United States. You know, Congress passed a law called DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act. My opponent was against it. It basically protected states from the action of one state to another. It also defined marriage as between a man and woman. But I\u2019m concerned that that will get overturned.

There\u2019s a \u2014 no, look, there\u2019s a systemic problem. Health-care costs are on the rise because the consumers are not involved in the decision-making process. Most health-care costs are covered by third parties. And therefore, the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care. And there\u2019s no market forces involved with health care. It\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts. These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax-free savings. Businesses can contribute, employees can contribute on a contractual basis. But this is a way to make sure people are actually involved with the decision-making process on health care. Secondly, I do believe the lawsuits \u2014 I don\u2019t believe, I know \u2014 that the lawsuits are causing health-care costs to rise in America. That\u2019s why I\u2019m such a strong believer in medical liability reform. In the last debate, my opponent said those lawsuits only caused the cost to go up by 1 percent. Well, he didn\u2019t include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the federal government some $28 billion a year and costs our society between $60 billion and $100 billion a year. Thirdly, one of the reasons why there\u2019s still high cost in medicine is because this is \u2014 they don\u2019t use any information technology.

And so, we\u2019ve got to introduce high technology into health care. We\u2019re beginning to do it. We\u2019re changing the language. We want there to be electronic medical records to cut down on error, as well as reduce cost. People tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, it\u2019ll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system. And finally, moving generic drugs to the market quicker. And so, those are four ways to help control the costs in health care."}

Let me give you a prime example. In the Senate we passed the right of Americans to import drugs from Canada. But the president and his friends took it out in the House, and now you don\u2019t have that right. The president blocked you from the right to have less expensive drugs from Canada. We also wanted Medicare to be able to negotiate bulk purchasing. The VA does that. The VA provides lower-cost drugs to our veterans. We could have done that in Medicare. Medicare is paid for by the American taxpayer. Medicare belongs to you. Medicare is for seniors, who many of them are on fixed income, to lift them out of poverty. But rather than help you, the taxpayer, have lower cost, rather than help seniors have less expensive drugs, the president made it illegal \u2014 illegal \u2014 for Medicare to actually go out and bargain for lower prices. Result - $139 billion windfall profit to the drug companies coming out of your pockets. That\u2019s a large part of your 17 percent increase in Medicare premiums. When I\u2019m president, I\u2019m sending that back to Congress and we\u2019re going to get a real prescription drug benefit. Now, we also have people sicker because they don\u2019t have health insurance. So whether it\u2019s diabetes or cancer, they come to hospitals later and it costs America more. We got to have health care for all Americans."}

One called it fiction. The other called it untrue. The fact is that my health-care plan, America, is very simple. It gives you the choice. I don\u2019t force you to do anything. It\u2019s not a government plan. The government doesn\u2019t require you to do anything. You choose your doctor. You choose your plan. If you don\u2019t want to take the offer of the plan that I want to put forward, you don\u2019t have do. You can keep what you have today, keep a high deductible, keep high premiums, keep a high co-pay, keep low benefits. But I got a better plan. And I don\u2019t think a lot of people are going to want to keep what they have today. Here\u2019s what I do: We take over Medicaid children from the states so that every child in America is covered. And in exchange, if the states want to \u2014 they\u2019re not forced to, they can choose to \u2014 they cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty. It\u2019s their choice. I think they\u2019ll choose it, because it\u2019s a net plus of $5 billion to them. We allow you \u2014 if you choose to, you don\u2019t have to \u2014 but we give you broader competition to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that senators and congressmen give themselves. If it\u2019s good enough for us, it\u2019s good enough for every American. I believe that your health care is just as important as any politician in Washington, D. C. You want to buy into it, you can. We give you broader competition. That helps lower prices. In addition to that, we\u2019re going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early. And most importantly, we give small business a 50 percent tax credit so that after we lower the costs of health care, they also get, whether they\u2019re self-employed or a small business, a lower cost to be able to cover their employees. Now, what happens is when you begin to get people covered like that \u2014 for instance in diabetes, if you diagnose diabetes early, you could save $50 billion in the health care system of America by avoiding surgery and dialysis. It works. And I\u2019m going to offer it to America."}

Anyway, let me quote the Lewin report. The Lewin report is a group of folks who are not politically affiliated. They analyzed the senator\u2019s plan. It cost $1.2 trillion. The Lewin report accurately noted that there are going to be 20 million people, over 20 million people added to government-controlled health care. It would be the largest increase in government health care ever. If you raise the Medicaid to 300 percent, it provides an incentive for small businesses not to provide private insurance to their employees. Why should they insure somebody when the government\u2019s going to insure it for them? It\u2019s estimated that 8 million people will go from private insurance to government insurance. We have a fundamental difference of opinion. I think government- run health will lead to poor-quality health, will lead to rationing, will lead to less choice. Once a health-care program ends up in a line item in the federal government budget, it leads to more controls. And just look at other countries that have tried to have federally controlled health care. They have poor-quality health care. Our health-care system is the envy of the world because we believe in making sure that the decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by officials in the nation\u2019s capital."}

I remember the 2000 campaign, people said if George W. gets elected, your check will be taken away. Well, people got their checks, and they\u2019ll continue to get their checks. There is a problem for our youngsters, a real problem. And if we don\u2019t act today, the problem will be valued in the trillions. And so I think we need to think differently. We\u2019ll honor our commitment to our seniors. But for our children and our grandchildren, we need to have a different strategy. And recognizing that, I called together a group of our fellow citizens to study the issue. It was a committee chaired by the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a Democrat. And they came up with a variety of ideas for people to look at. I believe that younger workers ought to be allowed to take some of their own money and put it in a personal savings account, because I understand that they need to get better rates of return than the rates of return being given in the current Social Security trust. And the compounding rate of interest effect will make it more likely that the Social Security system is solvent for our children and our grandchildren. I will work with Republicans and Democrats. It\u2019ll be a vital issue in my second term. It is an issue that I am willing to take on, and so I\u2019ll bring Republicans and Democrats together. And we\u2019re of course going to have to consider the costs. But I want to warn my fellow citizens: The cost of doing nothing, the cost of saying the current system is OK, far exceeds the costs of trying to make sure we save the system for our children."}

Most of the tax cuts went to low- and middle-income Americans. And now the tax code is more fair. Twenty percent of the upper-income people pay about 80 percent of the taxes in America today because of how we structured the tax cuts. People listening out there know the benefits of the tax cuts we passed. If you have a child, you got tax relief. If you\u2019re married, you got tax relief. If you pay any tax at all, you got tax relief. All of which was opposed by my opponent. And the tax relief was important to spur consumption and investment to get us out of this recession. People need to remember - Six months prior to my arrival, the stock market started to go down. And it was one of the largest declines in our history. And then we had a recession and we got attacked, which cost us 1 million jobs. But we acted. I led the Congress. We passed tax relief. And now this economy is growing. We added 1. 9 million new jobs over the last 13 months. Sure, there\u2019s more work to do. But the way to make sure our economy grows is not to raise taxes on small-business owners.

The American middle-class family isn\u2019t making it right now, Bob. And what the president said about the tax cuts has been wiped out by the increase in health care, the increase in gasoline, the increase in tuitions, the increase in prescription drugs. The fact is, the take-home pay of a typical American family as a share of national income is lower than it\u2019s been since 1929. And the take-home pay of the richest . 1 percent of Americans is the highest it\u2019s been since 1928. Under President Bush, the middle class has seen their tax burden go up and the wealthiest\u2019s tax burden has gone down. Now that\u2019s wrong. Now, with respect to immigration reform, the president broke his promise on immigration reform. He said he would reform it. Four years later he is now promising another plan. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll do: Number one, the borders are more leaking today than they were before 9\/11. The fact is, we haven\u2019t done what we need to do to toughen up our borders, and I will. Secondly, we need a guest-worker program, but if it\u2019s all we have, it\u2019s not going to solve the problem. The second thing we need is to crack down on illegal hiring. It\u2019s against the law in the United States to hire people illegally, and we ought to be enforcing that law properly. And thirdly, we need an earned-legalization program for people who have been here for a long time, stayed out of trouble, got a job, paid their taxes, and their kids are American. We got to start moving them toward full citizenship, out of the shadows. SCHIEFFER: Do you want to respond, Mr. President?"}

But the best way to protect our citizens from guns is to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns. And that\u2019s why early in my administration I called the attorney general and the U.

And the prosecutions are up by about 68 percent \u2014 I believe \u2014 is the number. Neighborhoods are safer when we crack down on people who commit crimes with guns.

But we ought to have an aggressive effort to make sure people are educated, to make sure when they get out of high school there\u2019s Pell Grants available for them, which is what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve expanded Pell Grants by a million students. Do you realize today in America, we spend $73 billion to help 10 million low- and middle-income families better afford college? That\u2019s the access I believe is necessary, is to make sure every child learns to read, write, add and subtract early, to be able to build on that education by going to college so they can start their careers with a college diploma. I believe the best way to help our small businesses is not only through small-business loans, which we have increased since I\u2019ve been the president of the United States, but to unbundle government contracts so people have a chance to be able to bid and receive a contract to help get their business going. Minority ownership of businesses are up, because we created an environment for the entrepreneurial spirit to be strong. I believe part of a hopeful society is one in which somebody owns something.

No Child Left Behind Act, I voted for it. I support it. I support the goals. But the president has underfunded it by $28 billion. Right here in St. Louis, you\u2019ve laid off 350 teachers. You\u2019re 150 \u2014 excuse me, I think it\u2019s a little more, about $100 million shy of what you ought to be under the No Child Left Behind Act to help your education system here.

I remember when Ronald Reagan was the president; he stood on principle. Somebody called that stubborn. He stood on principle standing up to the Soviet Union, and we won that conflict. Yet at the same time, he was very \u2014 we were very unpopular in Europe because of the decisions he made. I recognize that taking Saddam Hussein out was unpopular. But I made the decision because I thought it was in the right interests of our security. You know, I\u2019ve made some decisions on Israel that\u2019s unpopular. I wouldn\u2019t deal with Arafat, because I felt like he had let the former president down, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the kind of person that can lead toward a Palestinian state. And people in Europe didn\u2019t like that decision. And that was unpopular, but it was the right thing to do. I believe Palestinians ought to have a state, but I know they need leadership that\u2019s committed to a democracy and freedom, leadership that would be willing to reject terrorism. I made a decision not to join the International Criminal Court in The Hague, which is where our troops could be brought to \u2014 brought in front of a judge, an unaccounted judge. I don\u2019t think we ought to join that. That was unpopular. And so, what I\u2019m telling you is, is that sometimes in this world you make unpopular decisions because you think they\u2019re right. We\u2019ll continue to reach out. Listen, there is 30 nations involved in Iraq, some 40 nations involved in Afghanistan. People love America. Sometimes they don\u2019t like the decisions made by America, but I don\u2019t think you want a president who tries to become popular and does the wrong thing.

If he\u2019d let the inspectors do their job and go on, we wouldn\u2019t have 10 times the numbers of forces in Iraq that we have in Afghanistan chasing Osama bin Laden. Meanwhile, while Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons, some 37 tons of what they called yellow cake, the stuff they use to make enriched uranium, while they\u2019re doing that, North Korea has moved from one bomb maybe, maybe, to four to seven bombs. For two years, the president didn\u2019t even engage with North Korea, did nothing at all, while it was growing more dangerous, despite the warnings of former Secretary of Defense William Perry, who negotiated getting television cameras and inspectors into that reactor. We were safer before President Bush came to office. Now they have the bombs and we\u2019re less safe. So what do we do? We\u2019ve got to join with the British and the French, with the Germans, who\u2019ve been involved, in their initiative. We\u2019ve got to lead the world now to crack down on proliferation as a whole. But the president\u2019s been slow to do that, even in Russia. At his pace, it\u2019s going to take 13 years to reduce and get ahold of all the loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union. I\u2019ve proposed a plan that can capture it and contain it and clean it within four years. And the president is moving to the creation of our own bunker- busting nuclear weapon. It\u2019s very hard to get other countries to give up their weapons when you\u2019re busy developing a new one. I\u2019m going to lead the world in the greatest counterproliferation effort.

I\u2019ve asked in my security briefings why that is, and I can\u2019t go into all the answers, et cetera, but let me say this to you. This president and his administration have told you and all of us it\u2019s not a question of when, it\u2019s a question of \u2014 excuse me \u2014 not a question of if, it\u2019s a question of when. We\u2019ve been told that. The when I can\u2019t tell you. Between the World Trade Center bombing in, what was it, 1993 or so, and the next time was five years, seven years. These people wait. They\u2019ll plan. They plot. I agree with the president that we have to go after them and get them wherever they are. I just think I can do that far more effectively, because the most important weapon in doing that is intelligence. You\u2019ve got to have the best intelligence in the world. And in order to have the best intelligence in the world to know who the terrorists are and where they are and what they\u2019re plotting, you\u2019ve got to have the best cooperation you\u2019ve ever had in the world. Now, to go back to your question, Nikki, we\u2019re not getting the best cooperation in the world today. We\u2019ve got a whole bunch of countries that pay a price for dealing with the United States of America now. I\u2019m going to change that. And I\u2019m going to put in place a better homeland security effort. Look, 95 percent of our containers coming into this country are not inspected today. When you get on an airplane, your bag is X- rayed, but the cargo hold isn\u2019t X-rayed. Do you feel safer? This president in the last debate said, \u201cWell, that would be a big tax gap if we did that.\u201d Ladies and gentlemen, it\u2019s his tax plan. He chose a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans over getting that equipment out into the homeland as fast as possible. We have bridges and tunnels that aren\u2019t being secured, chemical plants, nuclear plants that aren\u2019t secured, hospitals that are overcrowded with their emergency rooms. If we had a disaster today, could they handle it? This president chose a tax cut over homeland security. Wrong choice."}

It\u2019s also a curious thing for him to say since right after 1993 he voted to cut the intelligence budget by $7.5 billion. The best way to defend America in this world we live in is to stay on the offense. We got to be right 100 percent of the time here at home, and they got to be right once. And that\u2019s the reality.

He\u2019s going to tax everybody here to fund his programs. That\u2019s just reality. And what are his health programs? First, he says he\u2019s for medical liability reform, particularly for OB\/GYNs. There\u2019s a bill on the floor of the United States Senate that he could have showed up and voted for if he\u2019s so much for it. Secondly, he says that medical liability costs only cause a 1 percent increase. That shows a lack of understanding. Doctors practice defensive medicine because of all the frivolous lawsuits that cost our government $28 billion a year. And finally, he said he\u2019s going to have a novel health care plan. You know what it is? The federal government is going to run it. It\u2019s the largest increase in federal government health care ever. And it fits with his philosophy. That\u2019s why I told you about the award he won from the National Journal. That\u2019s what liberals do. They create government-sponsored health care. Maybe you think that makes sense.

Secondly, we\u2019re at war. And I\u2019m going to spend what it takes to win the war, more than just $120 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan. We\u2019ve got to pay our troops more. We have. We\u2019ve increased money for ammunition and weapons and pay and homeland security. I just told this lady over here we spent \u2014 went from $10 billion to $30 billion to protect the homeland. I think we have an obligation to spend that kind of money. And plus, we cut taxes for everybody. Everybody got tax relief, so that they get out of the recession. I think if you raise taxes during a recession, you head to depression. I come from the school of thought that says when people have more money in their pocket during economic times, it increases demand or investment. Small businesses begin to grow, and jobs are added. We found out today that over the past 13 months, we\u2019ve added 1.9 million new jobs in the last 13 months. I proposed a plan, detailed budget, that shows us cutting the deficit in half by five years. And you\u2019re right, I haven\u2019t vetoed any spending bills, because we work together. Non-homeland, non-defense discretionary spending was raising at 15 percent a year when I got into office. And today it\u2019s less than 1 percent, because we\u2019re working together to try to bring this deficit under control. Like you, I\u2019m concerned about the deficit.

I\u2019ve even scaled back some of my favorite programs already, like the child-care program I wanted to fund and the national service program, because the president\u2019s deficit keeps growing and I\u2019ve said as a pledge, \u201cI\u2019m going to cut the deficit in half in four years.\u201d Now, I\u2019m going to restore what we did in the 1990s, ladies and gentlemen: pay as you go. We\u2019re going to do it like you do it. The president broke the pay-as-you-go rule. Somebody here asked the question about, \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you vetoed something?\u201d It\u2019s a good question. If you care about it, why don\u2019t you veto it? I think John McCain called the energy bill the \u201cNo Lobbyist Left Behind\u201d bill. I mean, you\u2019ve got to stand up and fight somewhere, folks. I\u2019m pledging I will not raise taxes; I\u2019m giving a tax cut to the people earning less than $200,000 a year. Now, for the people earning more than $200,000 a year, you\u2019re going to see a rollback to the level we were at with Bill Clinton, when people made a lot of money. And looking around here, at this group here, I suspect there are only three people here who are going to be affected - the president, me, and, Charlie, I\u2019m sorry, you too."}

I\u2019m going to shut that loophole, and I\u2019m going to give the tax benefit to the companies that stay here in America to help make them more competitive.

Third, what\u2019s really hurting American business more than anything else is the cost of health care. Now, you didn\u2019t hear any plan from the president, because he doesn\u2019t have a plan to lower the cost of health care. Five million Americans have lost their health care; 620,000 Missourians have no health care at all; 96,000 Missourians have lost their health care under President Bush.

They\u2019ve got a very limited view about how to use U.S. military forces to defend America. We heard Senator Kerry say the other night that there ought to be some kind of global test before U.S. troops are deployed preemptively to protect the United States. That\u2019s part of a track record that goes back to the 1970s when he ran for Congress the first time and said troops should not be deployed without U.N. approval.

A little tough talk in the midst of a campaign or as part of a presidential debate cannot obscure a record of 30 years of being on the wrong side of defense issues.

We\u2019ve actively and aggressively pursued him. We\u2019ve captured or killed thousands of Al Qaida in various places around the world and especially in Afghanistan. We\u2019ll continue to very aggressively pursue him, and I\u2019m confident eventually we\u2019ll get him. The key to success in Afghanistan has been, again, to go in and go after the terrorists, which we\u2019ve done, and also take down the Taliban regime which allowed them to function there, in effect sponsors, if you will, of the Al Qaida organization. John Edwards, two and a half years ago, six months after we went into Afghanistan announced that it was chaotic, the situation was deteriorating, the warlords were about to take over. Here we are, two and a half years later, we\u2019re four days away from a democratic election, the first one in history in Afghanistan. We\u2019ve got 10 million voters who have registered to vote, nearly half of them women. That election will put in place a democratically elected government that will take over next December. We\u2019ve made enormous progress in Afghanistan, in exactly the right direction, in spite of what John Edwards said two and a half years ago. He just got it wrong. The fact is, as we go forward in Afghanistan, we will pursue Osama bin Laden and the terrorists as long as necessary. We\u2019re standing up Afghan security forces so they can take on responsibility for their own security. We\u2019ll keep U.S. forces there \u2014 we have about 16,000 there today \u2014 as long as necessary, to assist the Afghans in terms of dealing with their security situation. But they\u2019re making significant progress. We have President Karzai, who is in power. They have done wonders writing their own constitution for the first time ever. Schools are open. Young girls are going to school. Women are going to vote. Women are even eligible to run for office. This is major, major progress. There will be democracy in Afghanistan, make no doubt about it. Freedom is the best antidote to terror."}

They then diverted their attention from the very people who attacked us, who were at the center of the war on terror, and so Osama bin Laden is still at large. Now, I want to go back to something the vice president said just a minute ago, because these distortions are continuing. He said that \u2014 made mention of this global test. What John Kerry said \u2014 and it\u2019s just as clear as day to anybody who was listening \u2014 he said: We will find terrorists where they are and kill them before they ever do harm to the American people, first. We will keep this country safe. He defended this country as a young man, he will defend this country as president of the United States. He also said very clearly that he will never give any country veto power over the security of the United States of America. Now, I know the vice president would like to pretend that wasn\u2019t said, and the president would too. But the reality is it was said. Here\u2019s what\u2019s actually happened in Afghanistan, regardless of this rosy scenario that they paint on Afghanistan, just like they do with Iraq. What\u2019s actually happened is they\u2019re now providing 75 percent of the world\u2019s opium. Not only are they providing 75 percent of the world\u2019s opium, large-cut parts of the country are under the control of drug lords and warlords. Big parts of the country are still insecure. And the reality is the part of Afghanistan, eastern Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is, is one of the hardest places to control and the most insecure, Gwen."}

When you include the Iraqi security forces that have suffered casualties, as well as the allies, they\u2019ve taken almost 50 percent of the casualties in operations in Iraq, which leaves the U.S. with 50 percent, not 90 percent. With respect to the cost, it wasn\u2019t $200 billion. You probably weren\u2019t there to vote for that. But $120 billion is, in fact, what has been allocated to Iraq. The rest of it\u2019s for Afghanistan and the global war on terror. The allies have stepped forward and agreed to reduce and forgive Iraqi debt to the tune of nearly $80 billion by one estimate. That, plus $14 billion they promised in terms of direct aid, puts the overall allied contribution financially at about $95 billion, not to the $120 billion we\u2019ve got, but, you know, better than 40 percent. So your facts are just wrong, Senator. You also have a situation where you talk about credibility. It\u2019s awfully hard to convey a sense of credibility to allies when you voted for the war and then you declared: Wrong war, wrong place, wrong time. You voted for the war, and then you voted against supporting the troops when they needed the equipment, the fuel, the spare parts and the ammunition and the body armor. You\u2019re not credible on Iraq because of the enormous inconsistencies that John Kerry and you have cited time after time after time during the course of the campaign. Whatever the political pressures of the moment requires, that\u2019s where you\u2019re at. But you\u2019ve not been consistent, and there\u2019s no indication at all that John Kerry has the conviction to successfully carry through on the war on terror."}

We need to battle them overseas so we don\u2019t have to battle them here at home. I\u2019m not challenging John Kerry\u2019s patriotism. I said in my acceptance speech in New York City at the Republican convention that we respected his service in Vietnam, and I got applause for that. We\u2019ve never criticized his patriotism. What we\u2019ve questioned is his judgment. And his judgment\u2019s flawed, and the record\u2019s there for anybody who wants to look at it. In 1984, when he ran for the Senate he opposed, or called for the elimination of a great many major weapons systems that were crucial to winning the Cold War and are important today to our overall forces. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and occupied it in 1990 and \u201991, he stood up on the floor of the Senate and voted against going in to liberate Kuwait and push Saddam Hussein back to Iraq. The problem we have is that, if you look at his record, he doesn\u2019t display the qualities of somebody who has conviction. And with respect to this particular operation, we\u2019ve seen a situation in which, first, they voted to commit the troops, to send them to war, John Edwards and John Kerry, then they came back and when the question was whether or not you provide them with the resources they needed \u2014 body armor, spare parts, ammunition \u2014 they voted against it. I couldn\u2019t figure out why that happened initially. And then I looked and figured out that what was happening was Howard Dean was making major progress in the Democratic primaries, running away with the primaries based on an anti-war record. So they, in effect, decided they would cast an anti-war vote and they voted against the troops. Now if they couldn\u2019t stand up to the pressures that Howard Dean represented, how can we expect them to stand up to Al Qaida?"}

I want to go back to what the vice president just said, because it\u2019s a continuation of the things he\u2019s been doing, unfortunately, on the campaign trail; it\u2019s a continuation of what he began his first answer with tonight. John Kerry has voted for the biggest military appropriations bill in the country\u2019s history. John Kerry has voted for the biggest intelligence appropriations in the country\u2019s history. This vice president, when he was secretary of defense, cut over 80 weapons systems, including the very ones he\u2019s criticizing John Kerry for voting against. These are weapons systems, a big chunk of which, the vice president himself suggested we get rid of after the Cold War. The reality is that John Kerry has consistently supported the very men that he served with in Vietnam and led. On the $87 billion, it was clear at the time of that vote that they had no plan to win the peace. We\u2019re seeing the consequences of that everyday on the ground right now. We stood up and said - For our troops, we must have a plan to win the peace. We also thought it was wrong to have a $20 billion fund out of which $7.5 billion was going to go to a no-bid contract for Halliburton, the vice president\u2019s former company. It was wrong then.

Basically, it\u2019s an echo. You made the comment that the Gulf War coalition in \u201991 was far stronger than this. No. We had 34 countries then; we\u2019ve got 30 today. We\u2019ve got troops beside us. It\u2019s hard, after John Kerry referred to our allies as a coalition of the coerced and the bribed, to go out and persuade people to send troops and to participate in this process. You end up with a situation in which \u2014 talk about demeaning. In effect, you demean the sacrifice of our allies when you say it\u2019s the wrong war, wrong place, wrong time, and oh, by the way, send troops. Makes no sense at all. It\u2019s totally inconsistent. There isn\u2019t a plan there. Our most important ally in the war on terror, in Iraq specifically, is Prime Minister Allawi. He came recently and addressed a joint session of Congress that I presided over with the speaker of the House. And John Kerry rushed out immediately after his speech was over with, where he came and he thanked America for our contributions and our sacrifice and pledged to hold those elections in January, went out and demeaned him, criticized him, challenged his credibility. That is not the way to win friends and allies. You\u2019re never going to add to the coalition with that kind of attitude. IFILL: Senator Edwards, 30 seconds."}

The reality about Iran is that Iran has moved forward with their nuclear weapons program on their watch. They ceded responsibility to dealing with it to the Europeans. Now, the vice president, as you pointed out, spoke out loudly for lifting the sanctions on Iraq. John Kerry and I believe we need to strengthen the sanctions on Iraq, including closing the loophole that allows companies to use a subsidiary, offshore subsidiaries to do business with Iran. I mentioned Halliburton a few minute ago in connection with the $87 billion, and you raised it in this question. This is relevant, because he was pushing for lifting sanctions when he was CEO of Halliburton. Here\u2019s why we didn\u2019t think Halliburton should have a no-bid contract. While he was CEO of Halliburton, they paid millions of dollars in fines for providing false information on their company, just like Enron and Ken Lay. They did business with Libya and Iran, two sworn enemies of the United States. They\u2019re now under investigation for having bribed foreign officials during that period of time. Not only that, they\u2019ve gotten a $7.5 billion no-bid contract in Iraq, and instead of part of their money being withheld, which is the way it\u2019s normally done, because they\u2019re under investigation, they\u2019ve continued to get their money."}

And let me just say a couple of preliminary things and then talk about where we are now. First, the Israeli people not only have the right to defend themselves, they should defend themselves. They have an obligation to defend themselves. I mean, if I can, just for a moment, tell you a personal story. I was in Jerusalem a couple of years ago, actually three years ago, in August of 2001, staying at the King David Hotel. We left in the morning, headed to the airport to leave, and later in the day I found out that that same day, not far from where we were staying, the Sbarro Pizzeria was hit by a suicide bomber in Jerusalem. Fifteen people were killed. Six children were killed. What are the Israeli people supposed to do? How can they continue to watch Israeli children killed by suicide bombers, killed by terrorists? They have not only the right but the obligation to defend themselves. Now, we know that the prime minister has made a decision, a historic decision, to unilaterally withdraw from Gaza. It\u2019s important for America to participate in helping with that process. Now, if Gaza\u2019s being used as a platform for attacking the Israeli people, that has to be stopped. And Israel has a right to defend itself. They don\u2019t have a partner for peace right now. They certainly don\u2019t have a partner in Arafat, and they need a legitimate partner for peace. And I might add, it is very important for America to crack down on the Saudis who have not had a public prosecution for financing terrorism since 9\/11. And it\u2019s important for America to confront the situation in Iran, because Iran is an enormous threat to Israel and to the Israeli people."}

You\u2019ve missed 33 out of 36 meetings in the Judiciary Committee, almost 70 percent of the meetings of the Intelligence Committee.

The first time I ever met you was when you walked on the stage tonight. In respect to Israel and Palestine, Gwen, the suicide bombers, in part, were generated by Saddam Hussein, who paid $25,000 to the families of suicide bombers. I personally think one of the reasons that we don\u2019t have as many suicide attacks today in Israel as we\u2019ve had in the past is because Saddam is no longer in business. We\u2019ve been strong supporters of Israel. The president stepped forward and put in place a policy basically that said we will support the establishment of two states. First president ever to say we\u2019ll establish and support a Palestinian state nextdoor to Israelis. But first, there has to be an interlocutor you can trust and deal with. And we won\u2019t have that, we don\u2019t have it now, in a Yasser Arafat. There has to be reform of the Palestinian system."}

We\u2019ve, of course, been through a difficult recession, and then the aftermath of 9\/11, where we lost over a million jobs after that attack. But we think the key is to address some basic, fundamental issues that the president\u2019s already working on. I think probably the most successful thing we can do with respect to ending poverty is to get people jobs. There\u2019s no better antidote to poverty than a good, well-paying job that allows somebody to take care of their own family. To do that, we have to make America the best place in the world to do business. And that means we\u2019ve got to deal effectively with tax policy. We\u2019ve got to reduce the litigation costs that are built into our society. We\u2019ve got to provide the adequate medical care and make certain that we can, in fact, create the opportunities that are vital to that process. I\u2019d zero in, in particular, on education. I think the most important thing we can do is have a first-class public school system. I\u2019m a product of public schools. And the president, his first legislative priority was the No Child Left Behind Act. It was the first piece of legislation we introduced. We got it passed that first summer on a bipartisan basis. We even had Ted Kennedy on board for the effort. And it does several things. It establishes high standards. It, at the same time, sets up a system of testing with respect to our school system, so we can establish accountability to parents and make certain that they understand how well their students are doing. And they have the opportunity to move students out of poorly performing schools to good schools. It strikes me that that is absolutely the heart of what needs to be done from the standpoint of education. It\u2019s also important, as we go forward in the next term, we want to be able to take what we\u2019ve done for elementary education and move it into the secondary education. It\u2019s working. We\u2019ve seen reports now of a reduction in the achievement gap between majority students and minority students. We\u2019re making significant progress."}

You know, if you look at what\u2019s happened over the last four years, we have gone from a $5 trillion projected surplus when George Bush took office to a $3 trillion projected deficit. They promised they were going to put $2 trillion of the surplus aside from Social Security. Not done. Not only that, it\u2019s the biggest fiscal turnaround in American history. And there\u2019s no end in sight. The Washington Post just reported they have several trillion dollars of additional tax cuts and spending, no suggestion of what they\u2019re going to do about it. John Kerry and I believe we have a moral responsibility not to leave trillions of debt to our children and our grandchildren. So here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do, to answer your question. To pay for the things that we believe need to be done \u2014 and I hope to get the chance to talk about health care and also about education, because we have plans on both of those subjects \u2014 what we\u2019re going to do is roll back tax cuts. And I want everyone to hear this, because there have been exaggerations made on the campaign trail - Roll back tax cuts for people who make over $200,000 a year; we will do that. We want to keep the tax cuts that are in place for people who make less than $200,000 a year and give additional tax cuts to those middle-class families, tax cuts for health care, tax cuts to help families pay for their college tuition, tax cuts for child care. These families are struggling and hurting, and they need more tax relief, not less tax relief. But to help get us back on the path to a balanced budget, we also want to get rid of some of the bureaucratic spending in Washington. One of the amazing things that\u2019s happened is they\u2019ve actually layered on more supervisory people, people at the supervisory level, in this government. We also want to close some corporate loopholes. Now, I want to be honest with people. We can\u2019t eliminate this deficit. People have heard that over and over and over in four years. We cannot do it. We\u2019re in too deep a hole. But we can cut the deficit in half. And if we move, we can move this country back on a path to fiscal responsibility."}

And I said then and I believe today that freedom does mean freedom for everybody. People ought to be free to choose any arrangement they want. It\u2019s really no one else\u2019s business. That\u2019s a separate question from the issue of whether or not government should sanction or approve or give some sort of authorization, if you will, to these relationships. Traditionally, that\u2019s been an issue for the states. States have regulated marriage, if you will. That would be my preference. In effect, what\u2019s happened is that in recent months, especially in Massachusetts, but also in California, but in Massachusetts we had the Massachusetts Supreme Court direct the state of \u2014 the legislature of Massachusetts to modify their constitution to allow gay marriage. And the fact is that the president felt that it was important to make it clear that that\u2019s the wrong way to go, as far as he\u2019s concerned. Now, he sets the policy for this administration, and I support the president."}

Let me say first, on an issue that the vice president said in his last answer before we got to this question, talking about tax policy, the country needs to know that under what they have put in place and want to put in place, a millionaire sitting by their swimming pool, collecting their statements to see how much money they\u2019re making, make their money from dividends, pays a lower tax rate than the men and women who are receiving paychecks for serving on the ground in Iraq. Now, they may think that\u2019s right. John Kerry and I do not. We don\u2019t just value wealth, which they do. We value work in this country. And it is a fundamental value difference between them and us. Now, as to this question, let me say first that I think the vice president and his wife love their daughter. I think they love her very much. And you can\u2019t have anything but respect for the fact that they\u2019re willing to talk about the fact that they have a gay daughter, the fact that they embrace her. It\u2019s a wonderful thing. And there are millions of parents like that who love their children, who want their children to be happy. And I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman, and so does John Kerry. I also believe that there should be partnership benefits for gay and lesbian couples in long-term, committed relationships. But we should not use the Constitution to divide this country. No state for the last 200 years has ever had to recognize another state\u2019s marriage. This is using the Constitution as a political tool, and it\u2019s wrong."}

We both believe that \u2014 and this goes onto the end of what I just talked about \u2014 we both believe that marriage is between a man and a woman. But we also believe that gay and lesbians and gay and lesbian couples, those who have been in long-term relationships, deserve to be treated respectfully, they deserve to have benefits. For example, a gay couple now has a very difficult time, one, visiting the other when they\u2019re in the hospital, or, for example, if, heaven forbid, one of them were to pass away, they have trouble even arranging the funeral. I mean, those are not the kind of things that John Kerry and I believe in. I suspect the vice president himself does not believe in that. But we don\u2019t \u2014 we do believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman. And I want to go back, if I can, to the question you just asked, which is this constitutional amendment. I want to make sure people understand that the president is proposing a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage that is completely unnecessary. Under the law of this country for the last 200 years, no state has been required to recognize another state\u2019s marriage. Let me just be simple about this. My state of North Carolina would not be required to recognize a marriage from Massachusetts, which you just asked about. There is absolutely no purpose in the law and in reality for this amendment. It\u2019s nothing but a political tool. And it\u2019s being used in an effort to divide this country on an issue that we should not be dividing America on. We ought to be talking about issues like health care and jobs and what\u2019s happening in Iraq, not using an issue to divide this country in a way that\u2019s solely for political purposes. It\u2019s wrong."}

Well let me say, first of all, I\u2019m proud of the work I did on behalf of kids and families against big insurance companies, big drug companies and big HMOs. We do have too many lawsuits. And the reality is there\u2019s something that we can do about it. John Kerry and I have a plan to do something about it. We want to put more responsibility on the lawyers to require, before a case, malpractice, which the vice president just spoke about, have the case reviewed by independent experts to determine if the case is serious and meritorious before it can be filed; hold the lawyers responsible for that, certify that and hold the lawyer financially responsible if they don\u2019t do it; have a three-strikes-and-you\u2019re-out rule so that a lawyer who files three of these cases without meeting this requirement loses their right to file these cases. That way we keep the cases out of the system that don\u2019t belong in the system. They talk about frivolous cases. We believe cases that don\u2019t belong in the system should never be in the system. But we don\u2019t believe that we should take away the right of people like Valerie Lakey, who was the young girl who I represented, five years old, severely injured for life, on a defective swimming pool drain cover. It turns out the company knew of 12 other children who had either been killed or severely injured by the same problem. They hid it. They didn\u2019t tell anybody. They could have fixed it with a 2-cent screw. That\u2019s wrong. John Kerry and I are always going to stand with the Valerie Lakeys of the world, and not with the insurance companies."}

I think the truth is that what they\u2019re doing is talking about an issue that really doesn\u2019t have a great deal to do with what\u2019s happening with medical cost in this country, which I think is a very serious issue. And I would be the first to say that what the vice president described a few minutes ago, problems with malpractice premiums, that\u2019s true, it\u2019s real. It\u2019s very real. What doctors talk about is very serious. And they\u2019re getting squeezed from both sides. I mean, because, they have trouble getting reimbursed, first of all, for the care that they provide, you know, from the government or from health-care companies. And, on the flip side, their malpractice costs are going up. That\u2019s very real, which is why we have proposed a plan to keep cases out of the system that don\u2019t belong there. But it\u2019s very important to put this in context. Because, in context, everything they\u2019re proposing, according to the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office, amounts to about half of 1 percent of health-care costs in this country \u2014 half of 1 percent. We have double-digit inflation in health care costs. We\u2019ve seen the largest rise in medical costs in the last four years in the country\u2019s history: $3,500 nationally. And nobody who\u2019s watching this debate needs me to explain this to them. They know it. Medicare premiums are up 17 percent on their watch. Again, largest increase in Medicare premiums in the history of Medicare. We think we have a plan to keep cases that don\u2019t belong in the system out, but we also do what they haven\u2019t done. Five million Americans have lost their health care coverage. Medical costs are skyrocketing. We have a serious health care plan to bring down costs for everybody, to cover millions more Americans and to actually stand up to drug companies and insurance companies which this administration has been unwilling to do."}

In some parts of the world, we\u2019ve got the entire, sort of, productive generation has been eliminated as a result of AIDS, all except for old folks and kids \u2014 nobody to do the basic work that runs an economy. The president has been deeply concerned about it. He has moved and proposed and gotten through the Congress authorization for $15 billion to help in the international effort, to be targeted in those places where we need to do everything we can, through a combination of education as well as providing the kinds of medicines that will help people control the infection. Here in the United States, we\u2019ve made significant progress. I have not heard those numbers with respect to African- American women. I was not aware that it was \u2014 that they\u2019re in epidemic there, because we have made progress in terms of the overall rate of AIDS infection, and I think primarily through a combination of education and public awareness as well as the development, as a result of research, of drugs that allow people to live longer lives even though they are infected \u2014 obviously we need to do more of that."}

John Kerry and I believe that needs to be doubled. And I might add, on the first year of their commitment, they came up significantly short of what they had promised. And we probably won\u2019t get a chance to talk about Africa. Let me just say a couple of things. The AIDS epidemic in Africa, which is killing millions and millions of people and is a frightening thing not just for the people of Africa but also for the rest of the world, that, combined with the genocide that we\u2019re now seeing in Sudan, are two huge moral issues for the United States of America, which John Kerry spoke about eloquently last Thursday night. Here at home we need to do much more. And the vice president spoke about doing research, making sure we have the drugs available, making sure that we do everything possible to have prevention. But it\u2019s a bigger question than that. You know, we have 5 million Americans who\u2019ve lost their health care coverage in the last four years; 45 million Americans without health care coverage. We have children who don\u2019t have health care coverage. If kids and adults don\u2019t have access to preventative care, if they\u2019re not getting the health care that they need day after day after day, the possibility of not only developing AIDS and having a problem \u2014 having a problem \u2014 a life-threatening problem, but the problem of developing other life-threatening diseases is there every day of their lives."}

And the vice president didn\u2019t say much about it in your earlier question, but Paul Bremer has now made clear that they didn\u2019t have enough troops and they didn\u2019t have a plan. And the American people are seeing the results of that every single day, in spite of the proud and courageous service of our men and women in uniform. Now, flip-flops: They should know something about flip-flops. They\u2019ve seen a lot of it during their administration. They were first against the 9\/11 Commission; then they were for it. They were for a department of homeland security \u2014 I mean, they were against the Department of Homeland Security; then they were for it. They said they were going to put $2 trillion of the surplus when they came into office aside to protect Social Security; then they changed their minds. They said that they supported the troops; and then while our troops were on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan, they went to the Congress and lobbied to have their combat pay cut. They said that they were going to do something about health care in this country. And they\u2019ve done something: They\u2019ve made it worse. They said that they were going to fund their No Child Left Behind; $27 billion short today. Over and over, this administration has said one thing and done another. This president said \u2014 I listened to him the other night at his 2000 debate saying: I\u2019m for a national patients\u2019 bill of rights. I know something about this.

And we\u2019re also going to finally do something about the cost of prescription drugs. They\u2019ve blocked allowing prescription drugs into this country from Canada. We\u2019re going to allow it. They would not allow the government to use its negotiating power to get discounts for seniors. We\u2019re going to allow it.

Now that we\u2019ve captured or killed thousands of Al Qaida and taken down the regimes of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban, it\u2019s important that we stand up democratically elected governments as the only guarantee that they\u2019ll never again revert to terrorism or the production of deadly weapons.

I know I can do a better job in Iraq. I have a plan to have a summit with all of the allies, something this president has not yet achieved, not yet been able to do to bring people to the table.

And smart means not diverting your attention from the real war on terror in Afghanistan against Osama bin Laden and taking if off to Iraq where the 9\/11 Commission confirms there was no connection to 9\/11 itself and Saddam Hussein, and where the reason for going to war was weapons of mass destruction, not the removal of Saddam Hussein. This president has made, I regret to say, a colossal error of judgment. And judgment is what we look for in the president of the United States of America. I\u2019m proud that important military figures who are supporting me in this race: former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili; just yesterday, General Eisenhower\u2019s son, General John Eisenhower, endorsed me; General Admiral William Crown; General Tony McBeak, who ran the Air Force war so effectively for his father \u2014 all believe I would make a stronger commander in chief. And they believe it because they know I would not take my eye off of the goal: Osama bin Laden. Unfortunately, he escaped in the mountains of Tora Bora. We had him surrounded. But we didn\u2019t use American forces, the best trained in the world, to go kill him. The president relied on Afghan warlords and he outsourced that job too. That\u2019s wrong."}

First of all, he made the misjudgment of saying to America that he was going to build a true alliance, that he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through the inspections. In fact, he first didn\u2019t even want to do that. And it wasn\u2019t until former Secretary of State Jim Baker and General Scowcroft and others pushed publicly and said you\u2019ve got to go to the U.N., that the president finally changed his mind \u2014 his campaign has a word for that \u2014 and went to the United Nations. Now, once there, we could have continued those inspections. We had Saddam Hussein trapped. He also promised America that he would go to war as a last resort. Those words mean something to me, as somebody who has been in combat. \u201cLast resort.\u201d You\u2019ve got to be able to look in the eyes of families and say to those parents, \u201cI tried to do everything in my power to prevent the loss of your son and daughter.\u201d I don\u2019t believe the United States did that. And we pushed our allies aside. And so, today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the cost - $200 billion \u2014 $200 billion that could have been used for health care, for schools, for construction, for prescription drugs for seniors, and it\u2019s in Iraq. And Iraq is not even the center of the focus of the war on terror. The center is Afghanistan, where, incidentally, there were more Americans killed last year than the year before; where the opium production is 75 percent of the world\u2019s opium production; where 40 to 60 percent of the economy of Afghanistan is based on opium; where the elections have been postponed three times. The president moved the troops, so he\u2019s got 10 times the number of troops in Iraq than he has in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is. Does that mean that Saddam Hussein was 10 times more important than Osama bin Laden \u2014 than, excuse me, Saddam Hussein more important than Osama bin Laden? I don\u2019t think so."}

It\u2019s the hardest decision a president makes. So I went to the United Nations. I didn\u2019t need anybody to tell me to go to the United Nations. I decided to go there myself.

They passed the resolution that said, \u201cDisclose, disarm, or face serious consequences.\u201d I believe, when an international body speaks, it must mean what it says. Saddam Hussein had no intention of disarming. Why should he? He had 16 other resolutions and nothing took place. As a matter of fact, my opponent talks about inspectors. The facts are that he was systematically deceiving the inspectors. That wasn\u2019t going to work. That\u2019s kind of a pre-September 10th mentality, the hope that somehow resolutions and failed inspections would make this world a more peaceful place. He was hoping we\u2019d turn away.

That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential that we make sure that we keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of people like Al Qaida, which we are. But to say that there\u2019s only one focus on the war on terror doesn\u2019t really understand the nature of the war on terror. Of course we\u2019re after Saddam Hussein \u2014 I mean bin Laden. He\u2019s isolated. Seventy-five percent of his people have been brought to justice. The killer \u2014 the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, is in prison.

The Philippines \u2014 we\u2019ve got help \u2014 we\u2019re helping them there to bring \u2014 to bring Al Qaida affiliates to justice there. And, of course, Iraq is a central part in the war on terror. That\u2019s why Zarqawi and his people are trying to fight us. Their hope is that we grow weary and we leave. The biggest disaster that could happen is that we not succeed in Iraq. We will succeed. We\u2019ve got a plan to do so. And the main reason we\u2019ll succeed is because the Iraqis want to be free. I had the honor of visiting with Prime Minister Allawi. He\u2019s a strong, courageous leader. He believes in the freedom of the Iraqi people. He doesn\u2019t want U.S. leadership, however, to send mixed signals, to not stand with the Iraqi people. He believes, like I believe, that the Iraqis are ready to fight for their own freedom. They just need the help to be trained. There will be elections in January. We\u2019re spending reconstruction money. And our alliance is strong. That\u2019s the plan for victory.

We didn\u2019t guard the nuclear facilities. We didn\u2019t guard the foreign office, where you might have found information about weapons of mass destruction. We didn\u2019t guard the borders. Almost every step of the way, our troops have been left on these extraordinarily difficult missions.

And so I decided that a better way to approach the issue was to get other nations involved, just besides us. And in Crawford, Texas, Jiang Zemin and I agreed that the nuclear-weapons-free peninsula, Korean Peninsula, was in his interest and our interest and the world\u2019s interest. And so we began a new dialogue with North Korea, one that included not only the United States, but now China. And China\u2019s a got a lot of influence over North Korea, some ways more than we do. As well, we included South Korea, Japan and Russia. So now there are five voices speaking to Kim Jong Il, not just one. And so if Kim Jong Il decides again to not honor an agreement, he\u2019s not only doing injustice to America, he\u2019d be doing injustice to China, as well. And I think this will work. It\u2019s not going to work if we open up a dialogue with Kim Jong Il. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what he wants. He wants to unravel the six- party talks, or the five-nation coalition that\u2019s sending him a clear message. On Iran, I hope we can do the same thing, continue to work with the world to convince the Iranian mullahs to abandon their nuclear ambitions. We worked very closely with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Great Britain, who have been the folks delivering the message to the mullahs that if you expect to be part of the world of nations, get rid of your nuclear programs. The IAEA is involved. There\u2019s a special protocol recently been passed that allows for inspections. I hope we can do it. And we\u2019ve got a good strategy."}

Under Governor Bush\u2019s tax cut proposal, he would spend more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of the new spending that he proposes for education, health care, prescription drugs and national defense all combined. Now, I think those are the wrong priorities. Now, under my proposal, for every dollar that I propose in spending for things like education and health care, I will put another dollar into middle class tax cuts. And for every dollar that I spend in those two categories, I\u2019ll put $2 toward paying down the national debt. I think it\u2019s very important to keep the debt going down and completely eliminate it. And I also think it\u2019s very important to go to the next stage of welfare reform. Our country has cut the welfare rolls in half. I fought hard from my days in the Senate and as vice president to cut the welfare rolls and we\u2019ve moved millions of people in America into good jobs.

Under the Medicare prescription drug proposal I\u2019m making, here is how it works, you go to your own doctor. Your doctor chooses your prescription. No HMO or insurance company can take those choices away from you. Then you go to your own pharmacy. You fill the prescription and Medicare pays half the cost. If you\u2019re in a very poor family or if you have very high costs, Medicare will pay all the costs, a $25 premium, and much better benefits than you can possibly find in the private sector. Now here is the contrast. 95% of all seniors would get no help whatsoever under my opponent\u2019s plan for the first four or five years.

We need to reform Medicare. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been opportunity to do so but this administration has failed to do it. And so seniors will have not only a Medicare plan where the poor seniors will have prescription drugs paid for, but there will be a variety of options. The current system today has meant a lot for a lot of seniors, and I really appreciate the intentions of the current system as I mentioned. If you\u2019re happy with the system you can stay in it. But there are a lot of procedures that haven\u2019t kept up in Medicare with the current times. No prescription drug benefits, no drug therapy, no preventative medicines, no vision care. We need to have a modern system to help seniors, and the idea of supporting a federally controlled 132,000-page document bureaucracy as being a compassionate way for seniors, and the only compassionate source of care for seniors is not my vision. I believe we ought to give seniors more options. I believe we ought to make the system work better. I know this. I know it will require a different kind of leader to go to Washington to say to both Republicans and Democrats, let\u2019s come together. You\u2019ve had your chance, Vice President, you\u2019ve been there for eight years and nothing has been done. My point is, is that my plan not only trusts seniors with options, my plan sets aside $3.4 trillion for Medicare over the next ten years.

I would be interested to see if he would say this evening he\u2019ll put Medicare in a lockbox. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think he will because under his plan if you work out the numbers \u00c2 $100 billion comes out of Medicare just for the wealthiest 1% in the tax cut. Now here is the difference. Some people who say the word reform actually mean cuts. Under the governor\u2019s plan, if you kept the same fee for service that you have now under Medicare, your premiums would go up by between 18% and 47%, and that is the study of the Congressional plan that he\u2019s modeled his proposal on by the Medicare actuaries. Let me give you one quick example. There is a man here tonight named George McKinney from Milwaukee. He\u2019s 70 years old, has high blood pressure, his wife has heart trouble. They have an income of $25,000 a year. They can\u2019t pay for their prescription drugs and so they\u2019re some of the ones that go to Canada regularly in order to get their prescription drugs. Under my plan, half of their costs would be paid right away. Under Governor Bush\u2019s plan, they would get not one penny for four to five years and then they would be forced to go into an HMO or to an insurance company and ask them for coverage, but there would be no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the terms and conditions."}

Now, in the short-term we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price from OPEC when they want to raise the price. And in the long-term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy. And domestic sources that are cleaner and better. And I\u2019m proposing a plan that will give tax credits and tax incentives for the rapid development of new kinds of cars and trucks and buses and factories and boilers and furnaces that don\u2019t have as much pollution, that don\u2019t burn as much energy, and that help us get out on the cutting edge of the new technologies that will create millions of new jobs. Because, when we sell these new products here, we\u2019ll then be able to sell them overseas. There is a ravenous demand for them overseas. Now, another big difference is Governor Bush is proposing to open up some of our most precious environmental treasures, like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for the big oil companies to go in and start producing oil there. I think that is the wrong choice. It would only give us a few months\u2019 worth of oil and the oil wouldn\u2019t start flowing for many years into the future. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a fair price to pay to destroy precious parts of America\u2019s environment.

First and foremost we have to fully fund LIHEAP which is a way to help low income folks, particularly here in the east to pay for high fuel bills. Secondly, we need an active exploration program in America. The only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home. You bet I want to open up a small part of Alaska. When that field is online it will produce one million barrels a day. Today we import one million barrels from Saddam Hussein.

There\u2019s a lot of shut-in gas that we need to be moving out of Alaska by pipeline. There\u2019s an interesting issue up in the northwest as well. Do we remove dams that produce hydroelectric energy? I\u2019m against removing dams in the northwest. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know where the vice president stands but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a renewable energy source of energy. We need to keep that in line. I was in coal country in West Virginia yesterday. There is an abundant supply of coal in America. I know we can do a better job of clean coal technologies. I\u2019m going to ask the Congress for $2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal technologies in the world. My answer to you is in the short-term we need to get after it here in America. We need to explore our resources and we need to develop our reservoirs of domestic production. We also need to have a hemispheric energy policy where Canada, Mexico and the United States come together. I brought this up recently with Vincent Fox the newly elected president in Mexico, he\u2019s a man I know from Mexico. I talked to him about how best to expedite the exploration of natural gas in Mexico and transport it up to the United States so we become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil. This is a major problem facing America. The administration did not deal with it. It\u2019s time for a new administration to deal with the energy problem."}

This is a very important topic and it\u2019s a very sensitive topic, because a lot of good people disagree on the issue. I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America. Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country. Life of the unborn. As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life. I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America. What I do believe is that we can find good, common ground on issues of parental consent or parental notification. I know we need to ban partial birth abortions. This is a place where my opponent and I have strong disagreement. I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America. This is an issue that will require a new attitude. We\u2019ve been battling over abortion for a long period of time. Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life. Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors to \u2014 to allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors. Surely we can work together to create a cultural life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbor\u2019s life with a gun will understand that that\u2019s not the way America is meant to be.

That\u2019s not the main issue. The main issue is whether or not the Roe v. Wade decision is going to be overturned. I support a woman\u2019s right to choose. My opponent does not. It is important because the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court. And Governor Bush has declared to the anti-choice groups that he will appoint justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who are known for being the most vigorous opponents of a woman\u2019s right to choose. Here is the difference. He trusts the government to order a woman to do what it thinks she ought to do. I trust women to make the decisions that affect their lives, their destinies and their bodies.

That is a very strong incentive that we\u2019ve given them to do the right thing. Bear in mind also, Milosevic has been indicted as a war criminal and he should be held accountable for his actions. Now, we have to take measured steps because the sentiment within Serbia is, for understandable reasons, against the United States because their nationalism \u2014 even if they don\u2019t like Milosevic, they still have some feelings lingering from the NATO action there.

Now those are the wrong priorities. $665 billion over ten years for the wealthiest 1%. As I said, almost 30% of it goes to Americans that make more than $1 million per year. Every middle class family is eligible for a tax cut under my proposal. Let me give you some specific examples. I believe college tuition up to $10,000 per year ought to be tax deductible so middle-class families can choose to send their children to college. I believe all senior citizens should be able to choose their own doctors and get prescription drugs from their own pharmacists with Medicare paying half the bill. I believe parents ought to be able to make more choices need more public and charter school choice to send their kids always to a safe school.

For those of you who he wants to scare into the voting booth to vote for him, hear me loud and clear. A promise made will be a promise kept. You bet we want to allow younger workers to take some of their own money. That\u2019s the difference of opinion. The vice president thinks it\u2019s the government\u2019s money. The payroll taxes are your money. You ought to put it in prudent, safe investments so that $1 trillion over the next ten years grows to be $3 trillion. The money stays within the Social Security system. It\u2019s a part of the Social Security system. He claims it will be out of Social Security. It\u2019s your money, it\u2019s a part of your retirement benefit. It\u2019s a fundamental difference between what we believe. I want you to have your own asset that you can call your own. That you can pass on from one generation to the next. I want to get a better rate of return for your own money than the paltry 2% that the current Social Security Trust gets today. Mr. Greenspan I thought missed an opportunity to say there\u2019s a third way, and that is to get a better rate of return on the Social Security monies coming into the trust. There is $2.3 trillion of surplus that we can use to make sure that younger workers have a Social Security plan in the future. If we\u2019re smart and if we trust workers and if we understand the power of the compounding rate of interest."}

I give a new incentive for younger workers to save their own money and invest their own money, but not at the expense of Social Security, on top of Social Security. My plan is Social Security plus. The governor\u2019s plan is Social Security minus. Your future benefits would be cut by the amount that\u2019s diverted into the stock market. If you make bad investments, that\u2019s too bad. But even before then the problem hits because the money contributed to Social Security this year is an entitlement. That\u2019s how it works. And the money is used to pay the benefits for seniors this year. If you cut the amount going in 1 out of every $6, then you have to cut the value of each check by 1 out of every $6 unless you come up with the money from somewhere else. I would like to know from the governor \u2014 I know we\u2019re not supposed to ask each other questions \u2014 but I\u2019d be interested in knowing, does that trillion dollars come from the trust fund, or does it come from the rest of the budget?"}

That is what it is. You leave future generations with tremendous IOUs. It\u2019s time to have a leader that doesn\u2019t put off tomorrow what we should do today. It\u2019s time to have somebody to step up and say look, let\u2019s let younger workers take some of their own money and under certain guidelines invest it in the private markets. The safest of federal investments yields 4%. That\u2019s twice the amount of rate of return than the current Social Security Trust. It\u2019s a fundamental difference of opinion here, folks. Younger worker after younger worker hears my call that says I trust you. And you know what, the issue is changing. Seniors now understand that the promise made will be a promise kept, but younger workers now understand we better have a government that trusts them and that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do."}

With all due respect, the Senate Budget Committee estimates that Dick Cheney has just referred to are the estimates of the partisan Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee. We\u2019re using the numbers presented by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. We start with an agreement which is this surplus in the Social Security fund should be locked up and used for Social Security. That\u2019s where the agreement ends. We also agree and believe and pledge that the surplus in the Medicare trust fund should also be locked up with a sign on it that says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153politicians keep your hands off.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Our opponents do not do that. In fact, they raid the Medicare trust fund to pay for, well, their tax cut and other programs that they can\u2019t afford because they\u2019ve spent so much on the tax cut. Let me come back to the remaining $1.8 trillion that we both talked about. The numbers show that $1.6 trillion goes to the big tax cut which, as Al Gore said the other night, sends 43% to the top 1%. Worse than that, when you add on the other spending programs that our opponents have committed to, plus the cost of their plan to privatize Social Security, by our calculations they\u2019re $1.1 trillion in debt. That means we go back down the road to higher interest rates, to higher unemployment, to a kind of self-tax increase on every American family. Because when interest rates go up, so, too, do the cost of mortgage payments, car payments, student loans, credit card transactions. So if we\u2019ve learned anything over the last eight years, it is that one of the most important things the government can do, the federal government, probably the most important, is to be fiscally responsible. And that\u2019s why Al Gore and I are committed to balancing the budget every year. In fact, the paying off the debt by the year 2012, when by our calculation our opponent\u2019s economic plan still leaves America $2.8 trillion in debt."}

Obviously in our time, fortunately, great advances have been made by women achieving the kind of equality that they were too long denied. Bernie, your question is absolutely right. Women \u2014 actually the number I have received 72 cents for every $1 a man receives in a comparable job. Al Gore and I have issued an economic plan in which we\u2019ve stated specific goals for the future. And one of those goals is to eliminate the pay gap between men and women. It\u2019s unfair and it\u2019s unacceptable. And the first way we will do that is by supporting the Equal Pay Act which has been proposed in Congress which gives women the right to file legal actions against employers who are not treating them fairly and not paying them equally. Secondly, we\u2019re going to do everything we can using governmental support of business agencies such as the Small Business Administration to help women business owners have an opportunity to invest and begin businesses and make larger incomes themselves. And there are other civil rights and human rights laws that I think can come to play here. So bottom line, this is an unfair and unacceptable situation. And even though, as the economy has risen in the last eight years, America\u2019s women have risen with it and received more income, until women are receiving the same amount of pay for the same job they\u2019re doing as a man receives, we\u2019ve not achieved genuine equality in this country. Al Gore and I are committed to closing that gap and achieving that equality. In so many families women are a significant bread earner or the only bread earner. So this cause affects not only the women, but families and the children as well."}

I want to clarify it briefly if I can. The first thing is the tax relief program that we\u2019ve proposed, one of the many tax credits for the middle class includes a $500 tax credit for stay-at-home moms just as a way of saying we understand that you are performing a service for our society. We want you to have that tax credit. Second, the number of 50 million Americans not benefitting from our tax cut program is absolutely wrong. It\u2019s an estimate done on an earlier form of our tax cut program and it\u2019s just plain wrong. And secondly, although Governor Bush says that his tax cut program, large as it is, gives a tax cut to everybody, as the newspapers indicated earlier this week, the Joint Committee on Taxation, again a nonpartisan group in Congress, says that 27 million Americans don\u2019t get what the governor said they would in the tax program. Al Gore and I want to live within our means. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to give it all away in one big tax cut and certainly not to the 1% of the public that doesn\u2019t need it now. We\u2019re focusing our tax cut on the middle class in the areas they tell us they need it. Tax credits for better and more expensive child care, tax credits for middle class families that don\u2019t have health insurance from their employers. The tax deduction I talked about earlier. Very exciting deduction for up to $10,000 a year in the cost of a college tuition. A $3,000 tax credit for the cost \u2014 well, actually for a family member who stays home with a parent or grandparent who is ill. And a very exciting tax credit program that I hope I\u2019ll have a chance to talk about later, Bernie, that encourages savings by people early in life and any time in life by having the federal government match savings for the 75 million Americans who make $100,000 or less up to $2,000 a year. Very briefly, if a young couple making $50,000 a year saves $1,000, the government will put another $1,000 in that account. By the time they retire, they\u2019ll not only have guaranteed Social Security, but more than $200,000 in that retirement fund. Now, that\u2019s \u2014"}

My answer is no, I would not support legislation that is being introduced in Congress to override the Food and Drug Administration decision on RU-486. The administration, FDA worked 12 years on this serious problem. They made a judgment based on what was good for women\u2019s health. A doctor has to pescribe and care for a woman using it. I think it\u2019s a decision we ought to let stand because it was made by experts. But let me say more generally that the significant difference here on this issue is that Al Gore and I respect and will protect a woman\u2019s right to choose. Our opponents will not. We know that this is a difficult personal, moral, medical issue, but that is exactly why it ought to be left under our law to a woman, her doctor and her God. Now, one area in which we agree, Al Gore and I, we believe that the government ought to do everything it can to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies. And, therefore, the number of abortions. Incidentally, here there is good news to report. The number of abortions is actually down in America over the last eight years. In fact, over the last eight years the number of teenage pregnancies has dropped 20%. And the reason it has is that there are good programs out there that Al Gore and I will continue to support, such as family planning and programs that encourage abstinence. But when the health of a woman is involved, I think the government has to be respectful. I supported, in fact, a bill in the Senate that would have prohibited late-term abortions except in cases where the health or life of the mother was involved. I did not support the so-called partial birth abortion bill because it would have prohibited that form of abortion at any stage of the pregnancy regardless of the effect on the health and life of the woman. That\u2019s unacceptable."}

I hope it marks the end of Milosevic. I think probably more than anything else it\u2019s a victory for the Serbian people. They\u2019ve taken to the streets to support their democracy, to support their vote. In some respects this is a continuation of a process that began ten years ago all across eastern Europe and has only now arrived in Serbia. We saw it in Germany, we saw it in Rumania, we saw it in Czechoslovakia, as the people of eastern Europe rose up and made their claim for freedom. And I think we all admire that. I think with respect to how this process has been managed most recently, we want to do everything we can to support Mr. Milosevic\u2019s departure. Certainly, though, that would not involve committing U.S. troops. I do think it\u2019s noteworthy that there appears to be an effort underway to get the Russians involved. I noted the other night, for example, Tuesday night at the debate in Boston, Governor Bush suggested exactly that we ought to try to get the Russians involved to exercise some leverage over the Serbians. It\u2019s now clear from the press that, in fact, that\u2019s exactly what they were doing. It\u2019s \u2014 Governor Bush was correct in his assessment and his recommendation. He has supported the administration on Kosovo. He lobbied actively against passage of the Byrd-Warner provision which would have set a specific deadline, one he felt was too soon, for forcing the U.S. troops out. He\u2019s been supportive of the policy that we\u2019ve seen with respect to Yugoslavia. And I think he deserves a lot of credit for that. I would go beyond that. I think this is an opportunity for the United States to test President Putin of Russia. That in fact now is the time we ought to find out whether he\u2019s committed to democracy. Whether or not he\u2019s willing to support the forces of freedom and democracy diplomatically there in the area of eastern Europe. And it\u2019s a test for him whether he represents the old guard in the Soviet Union. One of the most important challenges we face as a nation is how we manage that process of integrating those 150 million eastern Europeans into the security and economic framework of Europe."}

Numerous administrations going back certainly to World War II have had to wrestle with the problem of what should happen to the Middle East. We made significant breakthroughs, I think, at the end of the Bush administration because of the Gulf War. In effect, we had joined together with Arab allies and done enormous damage to the Iraqi armed forces. Iraq was the biggest military threat to Israel. By virtue of the end of the Cold War, the Soviets were no longer a factor. They used to fish in troubled waters whenever they had the opportunity in the Middle East. With the end of the Soviet Union, the implosion of the empire, that created a vacuum if you will, and made it easier for us to operate there. We were able to, I think, reassure both Arabs and Israelis would play a major role there. We have the ability and the will to deploy forces if we had to, to engage in military operations to help our friends and oppose our foes. We were able to convene them in a conference. The first time Arab and Israelis sat down face-to-face and began this process of trying to move the peace process forward. I think also a lot of credit goes to some great men like Yitzak Rabin. His tragic passing was of great consequence, a great tragedy for everybody who cares about peace in the Middle East. He was a man who had the military stature to be able to confidently persuade the Israelis to take risks for peace. I think Barak has tried to same thing. I hope that we can get this resolved as soon as possible. My guess is the next administration is going to be the one that is going to have to come to grips with the current state of affairs there. I think it\u2019s very important that we have an administration where we have a president with firm leadership who has the kind of track record of dealing straight with people, of keeping his word so friends and allies both respect us and our adversaries fear us."}

We\u2019ll have to see if that happens. The thing about Iraq, of course, was at the end of the war we had pretty well decimated their military. We had put them back in the box, so to speak. We had a strong international coalition raid against them, effective economic sanctions, and a very robust inspection regime was in place under the U.N. auspices and it was able to do a good job of stripping out the capacity to build weapons of mass destruction, the work he had been doing that had not been destroyed during the war in biological and chemical agents, as well as a nuclear program. Unfortunately now we find ourselves in a situation where that started to fray on us, where the coalition now no longer is tied tightly together. Recently the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, two Gulf States, have reopened diplomatic relations with Baghdad. The Russians and French are flying commercial airliners back into Baghdad and thumbing their nose at the international sanctions regime, and of course U.N. inspectors have been kicked out and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been absolutely no response. . We\u2019re in a situation today where our posture with Iraq is weaker than it was at the end of the war. It\u2019s unfortunate. I also think it\u2019s unfortunate we find ourselves in a position where we don\u2019t know for sure what might be transpiring inside Iraq. I certainly hope he\u2019s not regenerating that kind of capability, but if he were, if in fact Saddam Hussein were taking steps to try to rebuild nuclear capability or weapons of mass destruction, you would have to give very serious consideration to military action to \u2014 to stop that activity.

I think that\u2019s a matter of such critical national security importance that it ought to be left to the Commander in Chief, leaders of the military, Secretary of State to make that kind of decision without the heat of a political campaign. The fact is that we will not enjoy real stability in the Middle East until Saddam Hussein is gone. The Gulf War was a great victory. And incidentally, Al Gore and I were two of the ten Democrats in the Senate who crossed party lines to support President Bush and Secretary Cheney in that war. We\u2019re both very proud we did that. But, the war did not end with a total victory. Saddam Hussein remained there. As a result, we have had almost ten years now of instability. We have continued to operate almost all of this time military action to enforce a no-fly zone. We have been struggling with Saddam about the inspectors. We ought to do, and we\u2019re doing everything we can to get the inspectors back in there. But in the end there\u2019s not going to be peace until he goes. And that\u2019s why I was proud to co-sponsor the Iraq Liberation Act with Senator Trent Lott why I have kept in touch with the indigenous Iraqi opposition, broad based, to Saddam Hussein.

Aimed at a partnership for a new generation of vehicles with the American automobile industry which is making great progress and can produce a vehicle that can get 80 miles per gallon. We also have a short-term strategy. To deal with exactly the kind of ups and downs of energy prices. I know it was controversial, but Al Gore and I believed it was important in the short-term to reach into the strategic petroleum reserve, take some of the oil we have, put it in the market, show the big oil companies and the OPEC oil-producing countries that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got some resources with which we can fight back. We aren\u2019t going to lay back and let them roll over our economy. We did it also because gasoline prices were rising and home heating oil inventories were real low. Both of our tickets agree on LIHEAP keeping the low income housing assistance program, but our opponents offer no assistance to middle-class families hit by rising gas prices and a shortage of home heating oil. The fact is that since the reserve was opened the price of oil on world markets has dropped $6 a barrel. That\u2019s a good result and I\u2019m proud of it."}

My assessment is that there is no comprehensive energy policy today. That as a nation, we are in trouble because the administration has not addressed these issues. We have the prospects of brownouts in California. We have a potential home heating oil crisis in the northeast. We have gasoline price rises in various other places. For years now the administration has talked about reducing our dependence on foreign sources of oil, but they haven\u2019t done it. In fact, we\u2019ve gone exactly in the opposite direction. We have the lowest rate of domestic production of oil now in 46 years. You have to go back to 1954 to find a time when we produced as little oil as we do today. Our imports are at an all-time record high. In June we imported almost 12 million barrels of oil a day. That means we are more subject to the wide fluctuations and swings in price. We have other problems. We don\u2019t have refinery capacity. We haven\u2019t built a new refinery in this country for over ten years. They\u2019re operating at 96% or 97% capacity. Even with more crude available they\u2019re probably not going to be able to do very much by way of producing additional home heating oil for this winter. We have a growing problem with our growing dependence on foreign sources of energy. That will allways be the case but we ought to be able to shift the trend and begin to move it in the right direction. We need to do a lot more about generating the capacity for power here at home. We need to get on with the business and we think we can do it very safely in an environmentally sound manner. We don\u2019t think we ought to buy into this false choice that somehow we cannot develop energy resources without being cautious with the environment. We can. We have the technology to do it and we ought to do it. We do support the low income energy assistance program. We think it\u2019s important that senior citizens don\u2019t suffer this winter, but we need to get on to the business of having a plan to develop our domestic energy resources in producing more supplies, and this administration hasn\u2019t produced them."}

The Wyoming wilderness bill, frankly was one of my proudest achievements as a member of Congress. I worked on that with my good friend Al Simpson for about four years. We set aside a part of Wyoming, nearly a million acres of wilderness that ought to be separate and not be developed. We think that was important. There are a lot of areas around the country where Governor Bush and I support restraint. For example we support the moratorium on drilling off the coast of California, but there are places where we think we ought to go forward and develop those resources. The Arctic National Wildlife Reserve is one of them. It\u2019s on the north slope right next to Prudhoe Bay. The infrastructure is there to be able to deliver that product to market. We think we can do it given today\u2019s technology in a way that will not damage the environment, will not permanently marr the countryside at all, and so what we\u2019re looking for with respect to environmental policy and energy policy is balance. We do have to make choices, we recognize that. The way you phrased the question, frankly I welcome because it shows, in fact, we are trying to pursue a balanced approach and the suggestion that somehow all we care about is energy development isn\u2019t true. But we do have to get on with developing those resources or we\u2019re going to find ourselves ever more dependent on foreign sources. We\u2019re going to find that the fact that we don\u2019t have an energy policy out there is one of the major storm clouds on the horizon for our economy. I think if you look for something that could develop, some problem that could arise, that might, in fact, jeopardize our continuing prosperity, it\u2019s the possibility that we might find ourselves without adequate supplies of energy in the future. And there would be no quicker way to shut down our economy than that."}

The problem is accurately stated. No matter how strong we are economically, if we remain dependent on a source of energy that is outside our control, we\u2019re not going to be as strong as we should be. Others around the world can effectively yank our chain, and we cannot allow that to continue to happen. I\u2019m afraid that our opponent\u2019s response to this is one-sided, and it is essentially to develop the resources within the United States almost regardless of where. I\u2019m against drilling in the Arctic Refuge. This is one of the most beautiful, pristine places that the good Lord has created on earth. It happens to be within the United States of America. It\u2019s not worth it to do that for what seems to be the possibility of six months\u2019 worth of oil, seven to 12 years from now. That\u2019s not much of a response to the immediate problem that gasoline consumers and home heating oil customers are facing this winter. There are more resources within the United States that we can develop. This isn\u2019t mentioned much and appreciated much. In the last eight years drilling for gas on federal lands has gone up 60% and it\u2019s been done in an environmentally protected way. The administration has encouraged the drilling for deep gas and oil going on in the western Gulf today. The answer here is new technology that will create millions of new jobs. Let me just say this. If we can get three miles more per gallon from our cars we\u2019ll get a \u2014 we\u2019ll save 1 million barrels of oil a day, which is exactly what the refuge at its best in Alaska would produce. The choice to me is clear. We have to develop fuel cells, alternative energy, encourage people to conserve and to be efficient."}

I can pledge to the American people categorically that no one will lose benefits under our plan for Social Security as far forward as 2054. And let me come back and say, Bernie, that Al Gore and I view Social Security as probably the best thing the government did in the second half \u2014 the last century. It has created a floor under which seniors cannot fall, and so many of them depend on it for their basic living, for their livelihood. It\u2019s critically important to protect it. That\u2019s why Al and I have committed to putting that Social Security surplus in a lockbox, not touching it. That\u2019s what allows us to keep Social Security solvent to 2054. Our opponents have an idea for privatizing Social Security that will jeopardize Social Security payments to recipients. And I looked at this idea. If I may use an oil industry analogy, which is to say that sometimes as you know, Dick, better than I, you have to drill deep to find out whether there\u2019s oil in a well. For a while I was drilling into this idea of privatization of Social Security. The deeper I got the drier the well became and it seemed to me at the end it was going to dry up Social Security. It requires taking as much as a trillion dollars out of the Social Security fund. The independent analysts have said that would put the fund out of money in 2023, or if it\u2019s not out of money, benefits will have to be cut by over 50%. That\u2019s just not worth doing. Al Gore and I are going to guarantee Social Security and add to it the retirement savings plan that I mentioned earlier which will help middle-class families looking forward. They will have not only Social Security, but a superb extra retirement account as well. Social Security plus with us. With all due respect, Social Security minus from the Bush-Cheney ticket."}

It is such an assault on the basic promise that America makes that the law will treat individuals as individuals regardless of their status. That is to say their race, their nationality, their gender, sexual orientation, etcetera, etcetera. And the sad fact is that racial profiling occurs in this country. I have a few African-American friends who have gone through this horror and, you know, it makes me want to kind of hit the wall because it\u2019s such an assault on their humanity and their citizenship. We can\u2019t tolerate it anymore. That\u2019s why I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve supported legislation in the first instance in Congress. Because it\u2019s the most we could get done to do hard studies to make the case of the extent to which racial profiling is occurring in our country. But it\u2019s also why I\u2019m so proud that Al Gore said two things. First we would issue, if we\u2019re fortunate enough to be elected, an executive order prohibiting racial profiling. And secondly the first Civil Rights Act legislation we would send to Congress would be a national ban on racial profiling. It is just wrong. It is unAmerican, and to think that in the 21st Century this kind of nonsense is still going on. We have to stop it. The only way to stop it is through the law. The law, after all, is meant to express our values and our aspirations for our society. And our values are violently contradicted by the kind of racial profiling that I know exists. I had a friend a while ago who works in the government, works at the White House, African-American, stopped, surrounded by police for no other cause that anyone can determine than the color of his skin. That can\u2019t be in America anymore."}

I\u2019ve been thinking about it. I want to explain what my thoughts have been. Maybe I should begin this answer by going back to the beginning of the country and the Declaration of Independence which says there at the outset that all of us are created equal and that we\u2019re endowed not by any bunch of politicians or philosophers, but by our Creator, with those inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. At the beginning of our history, that promise that ideal was not realized or experienced by all Americans, but over time since then we have extended the orbit of that promise. In our time at the frontier of that effort is extending those kinds of rights to gay and lesbian Americans who are citizens of this country and children of the same awesome God just as much as any of the rest of us are. That\u2019s why I have been an original co-sponsor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act which aims to prevent gay and lesbian Americans who are otherwise qualified from being discriminated against in the workplace. And I\u2019ve sponsored other pieces of legislation and taken other actions that carry out that ideal. The question you pose is a difficult one for this reason. It confronts or challenges the traditional notion of marriage as being limited to a heterosexual couple, which I support. I must say I\u2019m thinking about this, because I have friends who are in gay and lesbian partnerships who said to me, isn\u2019t it fair. We don\u2019t have legal rights to inheritance, visitation when one partner is ill, to health care benefits. That\u2019s why I\u2019m thinking about it. My mind is open to taking some action that will address those elements of unfairness while respecting the traditional religious and civil institution of marriage."}

I don\u2019t agree with a lot of things he said in this campaign. But I have a lot of respect for him. He was a very distinguished Secretary of Defense, and I don\u2019t have anything negative to say about him. I want to say with the humility that is required to respond to this statement that I think what I would bring to the office of the vice presidency is a lifetime\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experience. Growing up in a working class family, having the opportunity to go to a great public school system, then to go on to college and then to be drawn really by President Kennedy, as well as the values of service my family gave me, into public life. Wanting to make a difference. I have had extraordinary opportunities, thanks again to those folks back home in Connecticut, \u00c2 as a state senator, attorney general trying to enforce the law to protect them and the environment and consumers, and to litigate on behalf of humans rights. And for the last 12 years as a member of the Senate of the United States focusing on national security questions, environmental protection, economic growth and values. But perhaps what I most bring is a friendship and shared values and shared priorities with Al Gore. I have tremendous respect for Al Gore. I\u2019ve known him for 15 years. He\u2019s an outstanding person as a public official and as a private person. His life is built on his faith. It\u2019s devoted to his family. He volunteered for service in Vietnam from the beginning. In Congress he\u2019s been willing to take on the big interests and fight for average people. As vice president I think he\u2019s been the most effective vice president in the history of the United States and he has the right program to use the prosperity all the American people have earned to help particularly hard working middle-class families raise up their children to enjoy a better life. I think that\u2019s what this is all about, why I\u2019m so proud to be his running mate."}

Let\u2019s see if I can put them in those terms. Joe established an outstanding record, I thought, in his work on this whole question of violence in the media. And the kinds of materials that were being peddled to our children. And many of us on the Republican side admired him for that. There is, I must say, the view now that having joined with Al Gore on the ticket on the other side, that the depth of conviction that we had admired before isn\u2019t quite as strong as it was, perhaps, in the past. The temptation on the one hand to criticize the activities of the industry, as was pointed out recently in the Federal Trade Commission where they\u2019re taking clearly material meant for adults and selling it to our children, while at the same time they are participating in fundraising events with some of the people responsible for that activity has been a source of concern for many of us. We were especially disturbed, Joe, at a recent fundraiser you attended where there was a comedian that got up and criticized George Bush\u2019s religion. I know you\u2019re not responsible for having uttered any words of criticism of his religion. My concern would be, frankly, that you haven\u2019t been as \u2014 as consistent as you had been in the past. That a lot of your good friends like Bill Bennett and others of us who had admired your firmness of purpose over the years have felt that you\u2019re not quite the crusader for that cause that you once were."}

First let me talk about that joke about religion which I found very distasteful. And believe me, if anybody has devoted his life to respecting the role of religion in American life and understands that Americans from the beginning of our history have turned to God for strength and purpose, it\u2019s me. And any offense that was done, I apologize for. I thought that humor was unacceptable. Let me come to the question of Hollywood and then answer the general question. Al Gore and I have felt for a long time, first as parents and then only second as public officials, that we cannot let America\u2019s parents stand alone in this competition that they feel they\u2019re in with Hollywood to raise their own kids and give their kids the faith and values they want to give them. I\u2019ve been a consistent crusader on that behalf. John McCain and I actually requested the Federal Trade Commission report that came out three or four weeks ago which proved conclusively that the entertainment industry was marketing adult-rated products to our children. That is just not acceptable. One finding was that they were actually using 10 to 12-year-olds to test screen adult-rated products. When that report came out, Al Gore and I said to the entertainment industry, stop it. If you don\u2019t stop it in six months, we\u2019ll ask the Federal Trade Commission to take action against you. There was no similar strong response from our opponents. We repeated that message when we went to Los Angeles. I repeat it today. We won\u2019t stop until the entertainment industry stops marketing its products to our children. Al Gore and I \u2014 I\u2019m out. Maybe I can come back to it."}

I must say, I wish one more person were here to watch and that is my dad, who died 15 years ago. If my dad were here, I would have the opportunity to tell him that he was right when he taught me that in America, if you have faith, work hard and play by the rules, there is nothing you cannot achieve. And here I am even the son of a man who started working the night shift on a bakery truck can end up being a candidate for Vice President of the United States. That says a lot about the character of this nation and the goodness of you, the American people. I will tell you that Hadassah and I have traveled around this country in the last couple of months and met thousands and thousands of parents just like our moms and dads, hard working middle-class people paying their taxes, doing the jobs to keep the country running. Trying so hard to teach their kids right from wrong and believing in their hearts that their kids can make it. I agree with them. But to make it they need a leader who will stand up and fight for them for good education, the best education in the world. For a sound retirement system, for prescription drug benefits for their parents. And for a government that is fiscally responsible, balances the budget. Keeps interest rates down so they can afford to buy a home or send their kids to college. To me Al Gore is that leader and will be that kind of president. You know, for 224 years Americans have dreamed bigger dreams and tried bolder solutions than any other people on earth. Now is not the time to settle for less than we can be. As good as things are today, Al Gore and I believe that with your help and God\u2019s help we can make the future of this good and blessed country even better.

This is a very important decision you\u2019re going to make on November 7. We have a fundamental choice between whether or not we continue with our old ways of big government, high taxes and ever more intrusive bureaucracy, or whether we take a new course for a new era. Governor Bush and I want to pursue the new course. We want to reform the Social Security system to guarantee benefits will be there for our retired folks, as well as make it possible for our young people to invest a portion of their payroll tax into a retirement account that they\u2019ll control and give them greater control over their own lives. We want to reform the Medicare system to make certain the benefits are there for our senior citizens, but also to provide prescription drug coverage for them and give them a range of choices in terms of the kind of insurance we have. We want to reform the education system. We want to restore our public schools to the greatness they once represented so that every parent has the opportunity to choose what is best for their child and so that every child has an opportunity to share in the American dream. We also want to reform the tax code. We think it\u2019s very important now that we have a surplus, that a portion of that surplus go back to the people who earned it. It\u2019s not the government\u2019s money, it\u2019s your money. You\u2019re entitled to it, and we would like to see to it that we provide tax relief for everybody who pays taxes. Finally, we think it\u2019s very important to rebuild the U.S. military. The military is in trouble. The trends are in the wrong direction. The finest men and women in uniform that you\u2019ll find anyplace in the world but they deserve our support. They deserve the resources that we need to provide for them and they deserve good leadership. George Bush is the man to do this. I\u2019ve seen him do it in Texas. What we need is to be able to reach across the aisle. Put together coalitions of Republicans and Democrats and build the kinds of coalitions that will get something done, finally, in Washington. George Bush is good man, an honorable man, a man of great integrity. He will make a first rate president."}

I also understand that an administration is not one person, but an administration is dedicated citizens who are called by the president to serve the country, to serve a cause greater than self, and so I\u2019ve thought about an administration of people who represent all America, but people who understand my compassionate and conservative philosophy. I haven\u2019t started naming names except for one person, and that\u2019s Mr. Richard Cheney who I thought did a great job the other night.

One of the things I\u2019ve done in Texas is I\u2019ve been able to put together a good team of people. I\u2019ve been able to set clear goals.

As soon as they have a change that allows the people to speak freely, they\u2019re wanting to develop some kind of blueprint that will help them be like us more, freedom, free markets, political freedom. So I think first and foremost our power ought to be wielded to in ways that form a more perfect union. The power of example is America\u2019s greatest power in the world. And that means, for example, standing up for human rights. It means addressing the problems of injustice and inequity, along the lines of race and ethnicity here at home, because in all these other places around the world where they\u2019re having these terrible problems, when they feel hope, it is often because they see in us a reflection of their potential. So we\u2019ve got to enforce our civil rights laws. We\u2019ve got to deal with things like racial profiling. And we have to keep our military strong. We have the strongest military, and I\u2019ll do whatever is necessary, if I\u2019m president, to make sure that it stays that way. But our real power comes, I think, from our values."}

The use of diplomacy in this situation has already, well, it goes hour-by-hour and day-by-day now. It\u2019s a very tense situation there.

Our country has been very active with regular conversations with the leaders there. And we just have to take it day-to-day right now. But one thing I would say where diplomacy is concerned, Israel should feel absolutely secure about one thing. Our bonds with Israel are larger than agreements or disagreements on some details of diplomatic initiatives. They are historic, they are strong, and they are enduring. And our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shepherd."}

Like the vice president, I call on Chairman Arafat to have his people pull back to make the peace. I think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the Middle East. I want everybody to know should I be the president Israel\u2019s going to be our friend. I\u2019m going to stand by Israel. Secondly, that I think it\u2019s important to reach out to moderate Arab nations, like Jordan and Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. It\u2019s important to be friends with people when you don\u2019t need each other so that when you do there\u2019s a strong bond of friendship. And that\u2019s going to be particularly important in dealing not only with situations such as now occurring in Israel, but with Saddam Hussein. The coalition against Saddam has fallen apart or it\u2019s unraveling, let\u2019s put it that way. The sanctions are being violated. We don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s developing weapons of mass destruction. He better not be or there\u2019s going to be a consequence should I be the president. But it\u2019s important to have credibility and credibility is formed by being strong with your friends and resolute in your determination. One of the reasons why I think it\u2019s important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace to be able to say to the Saddam Hussein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of the world or the Iranians, don\u2019t dare threaten our friends. It\u2019s also important to keep strong ties in the Middle East, credible ties, because of the energy crisis we\u2019re now in. After all, a lot of the energy is produced from the Middle East, and so I appreciate what the administration is doing. I hope to get a sense of should I be fortunate to be the president how my administration will react to the Middle East."}

I know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations. But the fact is that that\u2019s the situation that was left when I got there. And we have maintained the sanctions.

I know the governor\u2019s not necessarily saying that but, you know, all of these flights that have come in, all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime, I\u2019m told, except for three where they notified, and they\u2019re trying to break out of the box, there\u2019s no question about it.

Already just today the members of his political party said that they were going to ignore the orders of the new president of Serbia, and that they question his legitimacy, and he\u2019s still going to try to be actively involved. He is an indicted war criminal. He should be held accountable. Now, I did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier, and maybe I have heard, maybe I have heard the previous statements wrong, Governor. In some of the discussions we\u2019ve had about when it\u2019s appropriate for the U.S. to use force around the world, at times the standards that you\u2019ve laid down have given me the impression that if it\u2019s something like a genocide taking place or what they called ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, that that alone would not be, that that wouldn\u2019t be the kind of situation that would cause you to think that the U.S. ought to get involved with troops.

Now, just because we cannot be involved everywhere, and shouldn\u2019t be, doesn\u2019t mean that we should shy away from going in anywhere. Now, both of us are kind of, I guess, stating the other\u2019s position in a maximalist extreme way, but I think there is a difference here. This idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century, World War II. During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States. The lesson was that in the aftermath of World War I, we kind of turned our backs and left them to their own devices and they brewed up a lot of trouble that quickly became World War II. And acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did. We got intimately involved in building NATO and other structures there. We still have lots of troops in Europe. And what did we do in the late \u201940\u2019s and \u201950\u2019s and \u201960\u2019s? We were nation building. And it was economic. But it was also military. And the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there. We had civil administrators come in to set up their ways of building their towns back."}

I think a lot of times we just spend aid and say we feel better about it and it ends up being spent the wrong way, and there\u2019s some pretty egregious examples recently. One being Russia, where we had IMF loans that ended up in the pockets of a lot of powerful people and didn\u2019t help the nation.

The World Bank I think is generally doing a better job, but I think one of the big issues here that doesn\u2019t get nearly enough attention is the issue of corruption. The governor mentioned it earlier. I\u2019ve worked on this issue. It\u2019s an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies, like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials, that\u2019s one of the worst forms of it.

And we have a fundamental choice to make. Are we going to step up to the plate as a nation the way we did after World War II, the way that generation of heroes said okay, the United States is going to be the leader. And the world benefitted tremendously from the courage that they showed in those post-war years. I think that in the aftermath of the Cold War, it\u2019s time for us to do something very similar, to step up to the plate, to provide the leadership on the environment, leadership to make sure the world economy keeps moving in the right direction. Again, that means not running big deficits here and not squandering our surplus. It means having intelligent decisions that keep our prosperity going and shepherds that economic strength so that we can provide that leadership role."}

It\u2019s a culture that somewhere along the line we\u2019ve begun to disrespect life. Where a child can walk in and have their heart turned dark as a result of being on the Internet and walk in and decide to take somebody else\u2019s life?

And the reason it\u2019s so difficult for schools to control that is because in recent years there has been a flood of cheap handguns that are so widely available that kids are finding ways to get ahold of them. And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands."}

In other words, you say to a youngster, it will be in your financial interest to start saving for future illness, but for the working folks that do want to have health care that can\u2019t afford it, a couple of things we need to do. One, we need more community health centers. I\u2019ve developed \u2014 put out money in my budget to expand community health centers all around the country. These are places where people can get primary care. Secondly \u2014 and they\u2019re good. They\u2019re very important parts of the safety net of health care.

And to make health care more affordable, allow business associations like the National Federal of Independent Business or the Chamber of Commerce or the National Restaurant Association to write association plans across jurisdictional lines so that small businesses have got the capacity to have national pooling to drive the cost of insurance down. I think that\u2019s the very best way to go. It empowers people, it trusts people, it makes \u2014 and it\u2019s a practical way to encourage people to purchase health care insurance."}

There was a study just a few weeks ago suggesting that in summertime the north polar ice cap will be completely gone in 50 years. Already many people see the strange weather conditions that the old timers say they\u2019ve never seen before in their lifetimes. And what\u2019s happening is the level of pollution is increasing significantly. Now, here is the good news, Jim. If we take the leadership role and build the new technologies, like the new kinds of cars and trucks that Detroit is itching to build, then we can create millions of good new jobs by being first into the market with these new kinds of cars and trucks and other kinds of technologies. You know the Japanese are breathing down our necks on this. They\u2019re moving very rapidly because they know that it is a fast-growing world market. Some of these other countries, particularly in the developing world, their pollution is much worse than anywhere else and their people want higher standards of living. And so they\u2019re looking for ways to satisfy their desire for a better life and still reduce pollution at the same time. I think that holding onto the old ways and the old argument that the environment and the economy are in conflict is really outdated. We have to be bold. We have to provide leadership. Now it\u2019s true that we disagree on this. The governor said that he doesn\u2019t think this problem is necessarily caused by people. He\u2019s for letting the oil companies into the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Houston has just become the smoggiest city in the country. And Texas is number one in industrial pollution. We have a very different outlook. And I\u2019ll tell you this, I will fight for a clean environment in ways that strengthen our economy."}

This race is about values, it\u2019s about change, it\u2019s about giving choices to the American people. And education is my number one priority, because I think that it\u2019s the most important big major change that we can bring in our country. I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students. I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also. The difference is that while my plan starts with new accountability and maintains local control, it doesn\u2019t stop there. Because I want to give new choices to parents. To send their kids to college with a $10,000 tax deduction for college tuition per child per year. I want to reduce the size of the classrooms in this country. For one basic reason, so that students can get more one-on-one time with teachers. And the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers. I\u2019ve a plan in my budget to recruit 100,000 new, highly qualified teachers and to help local school districts build new schools. I think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and pre-school. Now, here is how that connects with all the rest of what we\u2019ve been talking about. If you have \u2014 if you squander the surplus on a huge tax cut that goes mostly to those at the top, then you can\u2019t make education the top priority. If the tax cut is your number one, two, three and four priority, you can\u2019t do education. You can\u2019t do both. You have to choose.

Tipper and I were good friends with Mel and Randy, and I know that all of us here want to extend our sympathy and condolences to Jean and the family and to the Sifford family.

This state became one of the top five in the nation for health care coverage for children under his leadership. One of the best in advancing all kinds of benefits for children to grow up healthy and strong. And of course, this debate also takes place at a time when the tragedy of the USS Cole is on our minds and hearts and insofar as the memorial service is tomorrow, I would like to also extend sympathy to the families of those who have died and those who are still missing, and the injured. Now, Mr. Hankins, I think that the situation that you describe has gotten completely out of hand. Doctors are giving prescriptions, they\u2019re recommending treatments, and then their recommendations are being overruled by HMOs and insurance companies. That is unacceptable. I support a strong national patient\u2019s bill of rights.

As a matter of fact, I brought Republicans and Democrats together to do just that in the State of Texas to get a patient\u2019s bill of rights through. It requires a different kind of leadership style to do it, though. You see, in order to get something done on behalf of the people, you have to put partisanship aside, and that\u2019s what we did in my state. We have one of the most advanced patient\u2019s bill of rights. It says, for example, that a woman doesn\u2019t have to go through a gate keeper to go to her gynecologist. It says that you can\u2019t gag a doctor, doctor can advise you. The HMO, the insurance company, can\u2019t gag that doctor from giving you full advice. And this particular bill, it allows patients to choose a doctor, their own doctor if they want to. But we did something else that was interesting. We\u2019re one of the first states that said you can sue an HMO for denying you proper coverage. Now there\u2019s what\u2019s called an Independent Review Organization that you have to go through first. It says if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a complaint with your insurance company, you can take your complaint to an objective body. If the objective body rules on your behalf, the insurance company must follow those rules. However, if the insurance company doesn\u2019t follow the findings of the IRO, then that becomes a cause of action in a court of law. It\u2019s time for our nation to come together and do what\u2019s right for the people, and I think this is right for the people.

I think one of the problems we have, particularly for seniors, is there is no prescription drug coverage in Medicare. And therefore, when they have to try to purchase drugs they do so on their own, there\u2019s no kind of collective bargaining, no power of purchasing among seniors. So I think step one to make sure prescription drugs is more affordable for seniors, and those are the folks who really rely upon prescription drugs a lot these days, is to reform the Medicare system, is to have prescription drugs as an integral part of Medicare once and for all. The problem we have today is like the patient\u2019s bill of rights, particularly with health care, there\u2019s a lot of bickering in Washington, D.C. It\u2019s kind of like a political issue as opposed to a people issue. So what I want to do is I want to call upon Republicans and Democrats to forget all the arguing and finger pointing, and come together and take care of our seniors\u2019 prescription drug program, that says we\u2019ll pay for the poor seniors, we\u2019ll help all seniors with prescription drugs. In the meantime, I think it\u2019s important to have what\u2019s called Immediate Helping Hand, which is direct money to states so that seniors, poor seniors, don\u2019t have to choose between food and medicine. That\u2019s part of an overall overhaul. The purchasing powers. And I\u2019m against price controls. I think price controls would hurt our ability to continue important research and development. Drug therapies are replacing a lot of medicines as we used to know it. One of the most important things is to continue the research and development component. And so I\u2019m against price controls. Expediting drugs through the FDA makes sense, of course. Allowing the new bill that was passed in the Congress made sense to allow for, you know, drugs that were sold overseas to come back and other countries to come back into the United States. That makes sense. But the best thing to do is to reform Medicare."}

If you want someone who will fight for you and who will fight for the middle-class families and working men and women, who are sick and tired of having their parents and grandparents pay higher prices for prescription drugs than anybody else, then I want to fight for you. And you asked a great question because it\u2019s not only seniors. Listen, for 24 years I have never been afraid to take on the big drug companies. They do some great things. They discover great new cures and that\u2019s great. We want them to continue that. But they are now spending more money on advertising and promotion. You see all these ads? Than they are on research and development. And they are trying artificially extend the monopoly patent protection so they can keep charging these very high prices. I want to streamline the approval of the competing generic drugs and the new kinds of treatments that can compete with them so we bring the price down for everybody. Now, briefly, let me tell you how my prescription drug plan works. The governor talked about Medicare. I propose a real prescription drug benefit under Medicare for all seniors, all seniors, and here\u2019s how it works. You pick your own doctor, and nobody can take that away from you. The doctor chooses the prescription that you need and nobody can overrule your doctor. You go to your own pharmacy and then Medicare pays half the price. If you\u2019re poor, they pay all of it. If you have extraordinarily high cost, then they pay all over $4,000 out-of-pocket. And I\u2019ll bring new competition to bring the price down. And if you pass the big drug companies\u2019 bill, nothing will happen."}

We\u2019ve spent 65 years now on the development of a hybrid system, partly private, partly public, and 85% of our people have health insurance, 15% don\u2019t. That adds up to 44 million people. That is a national outrage. We have got to get health coverage for those who do not have it and we\u2019ve got to improve the quality for those who do with a patient\u2019s bill of rights that\u2019s real and that works, the Dingle-Norwood bill, and we have got to fill in the gaps in coverage by finally bringing parity for the treatment of mental illness, because that\u2019s been left out. We have got to deal with long-term care. Now, here are the steps that I would take, first of all. I will make a commitment to bring health care coverage of high quality that is affordable to every single child in America within four years. And then we\u2019ll fill other gaps by covering the parents of those children when the family is poor or up to two and a half times the poverty rate. I want to give a tax credit for the purchase of individual health insurance plans. I want to give small business employers a tax credit, 25%, to encourage the providing of health insurance for the employees in small businesses. I want to give seniors who are, well, the near elderly, I don\u2019t like that term because I am just about in that category, but those 55 to 65 ought to be able to buy into Medicare for premiums that are reasonable and fair and significantly below what they have to get now. Now, we have a big difference on this. And you need to know the record here. Under Governor Bush, Texas has sunk to be 50th out of 50 in health care \u2014 in health insurance for their citizens. Last week he said that they were spending 3.7 billion dollars, or 4.7 billion dollars on this."}

One of the things the next president must do is to remind people that if we are going to have a responsible period in America, that each of us must love our children with all our heart and all our soul. I happened to believe strong accountability encourages parental involvement, though. I think when you measure and post results on the Internet or in the town newspapers, most parents say wait a minute, my child\u2019s school isn\u2019t doing what I want it to do and, therefore, become involved in education. I recognize there are some who just don\u2019t seem to care. But there are a lot of parents who feel like everything is going well in their child\u2019s school, and all of a sudden they wake up and realize that wait a minute, standards aren\u2019t being met. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so strong for accountability. I believe we ought to measure a lot, three, four, five, six, seven, eighth grade. We do so in my state of Texas. One of the good things we\u2019ve gone in Texas is we have strong accountability because you can\u2019t cure unless you know. You can\u2019t solve a problem unless you diagnose it. I strongly believe that one of the best things to encourage parental involvement also is to know that the classrooms will be safe and secure. That\u2019s why I support a teacher liability act at the federal level, that says if a teacher or principal upholds reasonable standards of classroom discipline they can\u2019t be sued. They can\u2019t be sued. I think parents will be more involved with education when they know their children\u2019s classrooms are safe and secure as well. I also believe that we need to say to people that if you cannot meet standards, there has to be a consequence. Instead of just comes the soft bigotry of low expectations, that there has to be a consequence. We can\u2019t continue to shuffle children through school. And one of the consequences to allow parents to have different choices."}

Last week I broke up \u2014 I suspended campaigning for two days, or parts of two days, to go back and participate in the meetings that charted the President\u2019s summit meeting that he just returned from earlier today. And our team of \u2014 our country\u2019s team over there did a great job. It\u2019s a difficult situation. The United States has to be strong in order to make sure that we can help promote peace and security and stability. And that means keeping our military strong. Now, I said earlier that we are the strongest military, but we need to continue improving readiness and making sure that our military personnel are adequately paid and that the combination of their pay and their benefits and their retirement as veterans is comparable to the stiff competition that\u2019s coming in this strong economy from the private sector. And I have supported the largest pay raise in many a year, and I support another one now. I also support modernization of our strategic and tactical weaponry. The governor has proposed skipping a generation of technology. I think that would be a mistake, because I think one of the ways we\u2019ve been able to be so successful in Kosovo and Bosnia and Haiti and in other places is by having the technological edge. You know, we won that conflict in Kosovo without losing a single human life in combat, a single American life in combat. Now, readiness. The trends before we \u2014 before I got my current job were on the decline, the number of divisions were reduced. I argued that we should reverse that trend and take it back up. And I\u2019m happy to tell you that we have. Now, in my budget for the next ten years I propose $100 billion for this purpose. The governor proposes $45 billion. I propose more than twice as much because I think it\u2019s needed."}

The force must be strong enough so that the mission can be accomplished. And the exit strategy needs to be well-defined. I\u2019m concerned that we\u2019re overdeployed around the world.

Should I be fortunate enough to earn your confidence, the mission of the United States military will be to be prepared and ready to fight and win war. And therefore prevent war from happening in the first place. There may be some moments when we use our troops as peacekeepers, but not often. The Vice President mentioned my view of long-term for the military. I want to make sure the equipment for our military is the best it can possibly be, of course. But we have an opportunity \u2014 we have an opportunity to use our research and development capacities, the great technology of the United States, to make our military lighter, harder to find, more lethal. We have an opportunity, really, if you think about it, if we\u2019re smart and have got a strategic vision and a leader who understands strategic planning, to make sure that we change the terms of the battlefield of the future so we can keep the peace. This is a peaceful nation, and I intend to keep the peace. Spending money is one thing. But spending money without a strategic plan can oftentimes be wasted. First thing I\u2019m going to do is ask the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan so we are making sure we\u2019re not spending our money on political projects, but on projects to make sure our soldiers are well-paid, well-housed, and have the best equipment in the world."}

Because a couple of times the governor has said that I am for a bigger government. Governor, I\u2019m not. And let me tell you what the record shows. For the last eight years I have had the challenge of running the streamlining program called Reinventing Government. And if there are any federal employees in this group, you know what that means. The federal government has been reduced in size by more than 300,000 people. And it\u2019s now the smallest number that we have had since the \u2014 the smallest in size since John Kennedy\u2019s administration. During the last five years, Texas\u2019s government has gone up in size. Federal government has gone down, Texas\u2019s government has gone up. Now, my plan for the future, I see a time when we have smaller, smarter government where you don\u2019t have to wait in line because you can get services online cheaper, better, faster. We can do that."}

And I think that you pointed the way in your comments, because when you say there are multiple things accomplished by farmers, you\u2019re specifically including conservation and protection of the environment. And yes, farmers are the first environmentalists. And when they decide not to plow a field that is vulnerable to soil erosion, that may cost them a little money, but it helps the environment. I think that we ought to have an expanded conservation reserve program. And I think that the environmental benefits that come from sound management of the land ought to represent a new way for farmers to get some income that will enable them \u2014 enable you to make sensible choices in crop rotation, and when you leave the land fallow and the rest. Now, I\u2019ll go beyond that and say I think we need much more focus on rural economic development programs. I see a time when the Internet-based activities are more available in the rural areas and where the extra source of income that farm families used to have from shoe factories is replaced by an extra source of income from working in the information economy. So we need to do a lot of things, but we ought to start with a better safety net."}

And if they don\u2019t do it, we\u2019re gonna ask for tougher authority in the hands of the FTC on the false and deceptive advertising. I\u2019ll tell you this, I want to do something about this.

And I want to tell you what I tell them. Sometimes people who are very idealistic and have great dreams, as young people do, are apt to stay at arm\u2019s length from the political process because they think their good hearts might be brittle, and if they invest their hopes and allow themselves to believe, then they\u2019re gonna be let down and disappointed. But thank goodness we\u2019ve always had enough people who have been willing in every generation to push past the fear of a broken heart and become deeply involved in forming a more perfect union. We\u2019re America, and we believe in our future and we know we have the ability to shape our future. Now, we\u2019ve got to address one of the biggest threats to our democracy. And that is the current campaign financing system. And I know they say it doesn\u2019t rank anywhere on the polls. I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s a fair measure. I\u2019m telling you, I will make it the \u2014 I will make the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform bill the very first measure that I send to the Congress as president. Governor Bush opposes it. I wish that he would consider changing his mind on that. Because I think that the special interests have too much power, and we need to give our democracy back to the American people. Let me tell you why. Those issues you mentioned, Social Security, prescription drugs, the big drug companies are against the prescription drug proposal that I\u2019ve made. The HMOs are against the patient\u2019s rights bill, the Dingle-Norwood bill that I support, and that Gov. Bush does not support. The big oil companies are against the measures to get more energy independence and renewable fuel. They ought to have their voices heard, but they shouldn\u2019t have a big megaphone that drowns out the American people. We need campaign finance reform and we need to shoot straight with young and old alike and tell them what the real choices are. And we can renew and rekindle the American spirit and make our future what our founders dreamed it could be. We can."}

It\u2019s all too easy for somebody in the majority in the population to say oh, we\u2019re just all the same, without an understanding of the different life experience that you\u2019ve had, that others have had.

Because we\u2019re able to draw on the wisdom and experience from different parts of the society that hadn\u2019t been tapped in the same way before. And incidentally, Mel Carnahan in Missouri had the finest record on diversity in any governor in the entire history of the State of Missouri. And I want to honor that among his other achievements here. Now, I just believe that what we have to do is enforce the civil rights laws. I\u2019m against quotas. This is, with all due respect, Governor, that\u2019s a red herring. Affirmative action isn\u2019t quotas. I\u2019m against quotas, they\u2019re illegal. They\u2019re against the American way. Affirmative action means that you take extra steps to acknowledge the history of discrimination and injustice and prejudice and bring all people into the American dream because it helps everybody, not just those who are directly benefitting."}

We reduced more regulations, eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors. But I have worked hard for things like the Family and Medical Leave Law, the Brady Bill, the assault weapons ban, the program to put 100,000 police on the street. All of these are programs that Senator Dole opposed that I supported, because I felt they were a legitimate effort to help people make the most of their own lives. I\u2019ve worked hard to help families impart values to their own children. I supported the V-chip so that parents would be able to control what their kids watch on television when they\u2019re young, along with the ratings systems for television and educational television. I supported strong action against the tobacco companies to stop the marketing, advertising, and sale of tobacco to young people. I supported a big increase in the safe and drug-free schools program. These were areas on which Senator Dole and I differed, but I believed they were the right areas for America to be acting together as one country to help individuals and families make the most of their own lives and raise their kids with good values and a good future."}

Let\u2019s look at the position. First of all, remember that in this campaign season, since Senator Dole\u2019s been a candidate, he has bragged about the fact that he voted against Medicare in the beginning, in 1965, one of only 12 members. He said he did the right thing then, he knew it wouldn\u2019t work at the time. That\u2019s what he said. Then his budget that he passed along with Speaker Gingrich cut Medicare $270 billion, more than was necessary to repair the Medicare trust fund. It would have charged seniors more for out-of-pocket costs as well as more in premiums because doctors could have charged them more. The American Medical, Hospital Association, the Nurses Association, the Catholic Hospital Association all said hundreds of hospitals could close and people would be hurt badly under the Dole-Gingrich Medicare plan that I vetoed. And now with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Senator Dole\u2019s, even his own friends, his campaign co-chair, Senator D\u2019Amato, says that they can\u2019t possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well, according to him. Now, my balanced budget plan adds ten years to the life of the Medicare trust fund, ten years. And we\u2019ll have time to deal with the long-term problems of the baby boomers. But it was simply wrong to finance their last scheme to cut Medicare $270 billion to run the risk of it withering on the vine. We always had to reform it over the years, but we need somebody who believes it in to reform it."}

It\u2019s a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans, and small business loans. It\u2019s not good to raise the deficit. We worked too hard to lower it. It will actually raise taxes on nine million people and, in addition to that, it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year. So it sounds great, but our targeted tax cut for education, child rearing, healthcare and home buying, which is paid for in my balanced budget plan, something that he has not done, certified by the Congressional budget office, that\u2019s the right way to go."}

The Senator mentioned the trial lawyers. In the case of the product liability bill, which they passed and I vetoed, I think that\u2019s what he\u2019s talking about, I actually wanted to sign that bill. And I told the people exactly what the Congress exactly what kind of bill I would sign. Now, a lot of the trial lawyers didn\u2019t want me to sign any bill at all, but I had thought we ought to do what we could to cut frivolous lawsuits, but they wouldn\u2019t make some of the changes that I thought should be made. Now, let me just give you an example. I had a person in the Oval Office who lost a child in a school bus accident where a drunk driver caused the accident directly, but there were problems with the school bus. The drunk driver had no money. Under the new bill, if I had signed it, a person like that could never have had any recovery. I thought that was wrong. So I gave four or five specific examples to the Congress and said, prove to me that these people could recover but we\u2019re going to eliminate frivolous lawsuits, I\u2019ll sign the bill. But generally I believe that a president has to be willing to do what he thinks is right. I\u2019ve done a lot of things that were controversial. My economic plan, my trade position, Bosnia, Haiti, taking on the NRA for the first time, taking on the tobacco companies for the first time. Sometimes you just have to do that because you know it\u2019s right for the country over the long run. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried to do and that\u2019s what I will continue to do as president."}

That was certainly the case from the minute I got there. So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested \u2014 a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission. And I shook hands with him on it and I appointed my members, and the commission never met. And then Senator Dole\u2019s ardent supporters, Senator McCain, who\u2019s out there today, along with Senator Feingold, supported, sponsored a campaign finance reform proposal. I strongly supported it. And members of Senator Dole\u2019s own party in the Senate killed it. And he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill. So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have. And I hope we can finally get it in the next session of Congress, because we need it badly."}

I am. But let\u2019s look at the overall record. Overall in America cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years, casual drug use down 13 percent. The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it. Let me tell you what I tried to do about it. I appointed a four-star general who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country as our nation\u2019s drug czar. The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired. We submitted the biggest drug budget ever. We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border. We supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including, including the death penalty for drug kingpins. And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug-free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all those things were very important. Do I think that I bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still don\u2019t understand drugs are wrong, drugs can kill you. Even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them. I think we all do. And I hope we can do better. I don\u2019t think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I don\u2019t think Senator Dole supports using using drugs. I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn\u2019t dangerous and won\u2019t kill them and won\u2019t destroy their lives, get the message and change."}

He didn\u2019t succeed and I signed it and I\u2019m glad I did. Then when we had the assault weapons ban in the Senate, Senator Dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the National Rifle Association didn\u2019t want the assault weapons ban, just like they didn\u2019t want the Brady Bill. But two years later nobody\u2019s lost their handguns. I mean, their rifles. We\u2019ve expanded the Brady Bill to cover people who beat up their spouses and their kids. And this is a safer country.

I have worked to support our country as the world\u2019s strongest force for peace and freedom, prosperity and security. We have done the following things - Number one, we\u2019ve managed the aftermath of the Cold War, supporting a big drop in nuclear weapons in Russia. The removal of Russian troops from the Baltics. The integration of Central and Eastern European democracies into a new partnership with NATO. And, I might add, with the democratic Russia. There are no nuclear missiles pointed at the children of the United States tonight and have not been in our administration for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age. We have worked hard for peace and freedom. When I took office, Haiti was governed by a dictator that had defied the United States. When I took office, the worst war in Europe was waging in Bosnia. Now there is a the democratically elected president in Haiti. Peace in Bosnia. We just had the election there. We\u2019ve made progress in Northern Ireland, in the Middle East. We\u2019ve also stood up to the new threats of terrorism. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, and we have worked hard to expand America\u2019s economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade with the largest new number of trade agreements in history And that\u2019s one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again."}

They didn\u2019t have the weapons, they didn\u2019t have the tanks. They asked for the tanks. They didn\u2019t get the tanks from this administration because we were nation building. It\u2019s called mission creep. We turn it over to the United Nations. The President didn\u2019t have much to do about it. You look at Haiti, where we spend about three billion dollars and we got an alarm call there about two weeks ago. You got to send down some more people, because the president\u2019s found out there are death squads on his on his, in his own property. So we need more protection from America. Bosnia, Northern Ireland. There\u2019s no ceasefire in Bosnia. I think there are still lot of problems in Bosnia. We agreed to train and arm the Muslims so they could defend themselves, the policy you had when you ran in 1992. We haven\u2019t done that. We\u2019re way behind, which means Americans can\u2019t come home.

Healthcare. Well, we finally passed the Kassebaum bill. The President was opposed to it in 1993. He wanted to give us this big system, that took over about one-seventh of the economy, that put on price controls, created all these state alliances, and would cost $1.5 trillion and force people into managed care, whether they wanted it or not. Most people want to see their own doctor. They\u2019re going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president. We won\u2019t threaten anybody. So we passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy, the Kennedy Kassebaum bill that will cover about 20 to 25 million people. We\u2019ve been for that for four, five, six years. The President held it up. And even when it finally got near passage, Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days, because he wasn\u2019t satisfied with one provision. But it will cover preexisting conditions. If you change your job, you\u2019re going to be covered. So there are a lot of good things in this bill we should have done instead of trying this massive, massive takeover by the Federal government. But then of course we had a Democratic Congress and they didn\u2019t want to do that. Until we got a Republican Congress, we finally got action, I\u2019m proud of my colleagues in the Republican Party for getting that done. It means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight."}

And they said no because they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big government and make sure nothing was done to aid healthcare before the \u201994 elections so they could make that claim. Well, maybe we bit off more than we could chew, but we\u2019re pursuing a step-by-step reform now. The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that I signed will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change jobs or when somebody in their family\u2019s been sick. I signed a bill to stop these drive-by deliveries when insurance companies can force people out of the hospital after 24 hours and I vetoed Senator Dole\u2019s Medicare plan that would have forced a lot of seniors into managed care and taken a lot more money out of their pockets and led to Medicare withering on the vine."}

If we\u2019re going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be done at the local level or the state level. But Senator Dole has consistently opposed Federal help to education. He voted against student loans; he voted against my improved student loan plan; he voted against the National Service bill, against the HeadStart bill; he voted against our efforts in safe and drug-free schools. He voted against these programs, he does not believe it.

You, it\u2019s amazing to me, you are all for having more responsibility at the local level for everything except schools.

If a local school district in Cleveland or anyplace else wants to have a private choice plan like Milwaukee did, let them have at it. I might say the results are highly ambiguous.

It\u2019s inconvenient for Senator Dole, but the truth is I\u2019ve reduced the size of government more than my Republican predecessors. And I did stop them, I admit that. I sure stopped their budget. Their budget cut enforcement for the Environmental Protection Agency by a third. It cut funds to clean up toxic waste dumps with 10 million of our kids still living within four miles of a toxic waste dump, by a third. It ended the principle that the polluters should pay for those toxic waste dumps unless it was very recent. Their budget weakened our support for education. $30 billion, even cut funds for scholarships and college loans. Their budget cut $270 billion in Medicare and, finally, their budget withdrew the national guarantee of healthcare to poor children, families with children with handicaps, the elderly in nursing homes, poor pregnant women.

I think a targeted tax cut is better for our future, targeted to education and child rearing, with the rest of the education plan, hooking up all of our classrooms to the Internet by the year 2000. Making sure we\u2019ve got an army of reading volunteers, trained people to teach with parents and teachers so that our eight year olds can learn to read. Investing in our environment. Cleaning up two-thirds of the worst toxic waste dumps. Those plans are better than this $550 billion tax scheme.

Bill Clinton, the President, and Al Gore, suggest that they\u2019ll give us a tax cut, but only if we do exactly what they want us to do. That isn\u2019t America. That\u2019s social engineering. The tax code should reflect our values in a Judeo-Christian sense, that work, honesty and integrity and contracts and property and investment and savings should be rewarded, and Bob Dole and Jack Kemp are not only going to cut the tax rates across the board and lower the Capital Gain Tax. I\u2019ll be glad to talk about it a little later, because there\u2019s not enough time, but we are going to repeal the 83-year-old code and replace the seven and a half million words with a flatter, fairer, simpler code that will take this country roaring in the 21st Century."}

The environment faces dire threats from the kind of legislation that Senator Dole and Speaker Newt Gingrich tried to pass by shutting down the government and attempting to force President Clinton to accept it. They invited the lobbyists for the biggest polluters in America to come into the Congress and literally rewrite the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act. President Clinton stopped them dead in their tracks. We have a positive agenda on the environment because we believe very deeply that it\u2019s about our children and our future. Clean air and clean water, cleaning up toxic waste sites, when millions of children live within one mile of them. That\u2019s important.

Our empowerment zones and enterprise communities, the tax credits that will encourage the formation of new businesses, the new approach by the small business administration to get more loans out to individuals that have not had equal access to capital in the past. These are parts of the plan. Another part of it is the community development financial institutions. And the \u2014 and the law that says deposits that are made in a community, in the inner cities say, should be kept in the community, not entirely, but some percentage of them should be kept there.

I\u2019ve tried to make that clear tonight. And one reason I\u2019ve tried to make it clear is that in just 27 days, the United States of America has an important choice to make. Between two approaches to the future of this country. We have a plan that will create millions more jobs, bring the deficits down further and balance the budget, while protecting Medicare, protecting Medicaid, protecting and preserving the environment, our air, our water, the Everglades, the Tongas, the Mojave Desert in California, the Utah-Red Rocks area, all of which have been protected by President Bill Clinton. We also have a plan to expand access to education. There\u2019s a family in the audience tonight, the McNeil family, who lives right here in St. Petersburg. Both parents are teachers, they\u2019re not rich in money, but they have strong values and they value education. They\u2019re oldest son is a freshman at St. Petersburg Junior High \u2014 Junior College. Their younger son, Roderick, is a sophomore in the same high school that Don McNeil teaches at. Roderick is concerned that he may not be able to get the tuition he needs to go to college when the time comes. Our plan gives a $1500 tax credit to make that junior college essentially free. And a $10,000 tax deduction to make it so that no American family, or almost no family, will have to pay taxes on the money they pay for college tuition. This plan also gives tax breaks on the sale of a home, up to $500,000 in profit tax free. It gives the new break for first-time home buyers, and, again, all in the context of a balanced budget. We have seen progress during the last four years because policies like these have been working. This risky scheme that I\u2019ve described tonight has been said by many objective observers to not add up, it would be a serious risk. Our plan, by contrast, has been working and will work more.

You know, if they asked me to be part of some monitoring force \u2014 as we are in the Sinai and have been since 1978 \u2014 to monitor the peace between Egypt and Israel, frankly, I would have to think about it.

Social Security is stable until, as you pointed out, at least the third decade of the next century. But we\u2019d like to have a Social Security fund that has about 70 years of life instead of about 30 years of life. What we have to do is simply to make some adjustments to take account of the fact that the baby boomers, people like me, are bigger in number than the people that went just before us and the people that come just after us. And I think what we\u2019ll plainly do is what we did in 1983 when Senator Dole served, and this is something I think he did a good job on when he served on the Social Security commission and they made some modest changes in Social Security to make sure that it would be alive and well into the 21st century. And we will do that. It\u2019s obvious that there are certain things that have to be done and there are 50 or 60 different options, and a bipartisan commission to take it out of politics, will make recommendations and build support for the people. Medicare is different. Medicare needs help now. I have proposed a budget which would put ten years on the life of the Medicare trust fund. That\u2019s more than it\u2019s had a lot of the time in the last years. It would save a lot of money through more managed care, by giving more options, more preventative care and lowering the inflation rate and the prices we\u2019re paying providers without having the kind of big premium increases and out-of-pocket costs that the budget I vetoed would provide. Then that would give us ten years to do with Medicare what we\u2019re going to do with Social Security; have a bipartisan group look at what we have to do to save it when the baby boomers retire. But now we can, we ought to pass this budget now and put ten years on it right away so no one has to worry about it."}

So I\u2019ve been working on it when I was a governor for a long time. When I became president I used the authority I had in this law to get out from certain federal rules to help states move people to work. We reduced the welfare rolls by 2 million already. Now, I\u2019ve got a plan with this new welfare reform law to work with the private sector, to give employees specific tax incentives to hire people off welfare, and to do some other things which will create more jobs in the private sector, at least a million, and move more people from welfare to work. It\u2019s very important. And I hope we get a chance to talk about this more. There\u2019s not a more important issue. I, I still remember a woman that I met ten years ago who said she wanted to get off welfare so her kids could tell, give an answer when they say, \u201cWhat does your mother do for a job?\u201d I met that woman again. She\u2019s got four kids. One\u2019s got a good job, one\u2019s studying to be a doctor. One\u2019s in technical school, one\u2019s an honor student in high school.

Rudy Giuliani, Mayor of New York, brought crime down 25 percent just in New York City. Of course the president will take credit for that. My view is we want to find jobs and opportunities and education. This year the Republican Congress, as far as student loans went from 24 billion to 36 billion over the next six years. A 50 percent increase. The highest appropriation. 6 billion dollars for Pell Grants, very, very important. We also raised the amount of each Pell Grant. In our economic plan, the $500 child credit can be used for young people, rolled over and over and over, you, of course not this age, but if you have a child two years old, 7 percent interest would be worth about $18,000 by the time that child was ready for college."}

I\u2019ve done more to eliminate Affirmative Action programs I didn\u2019t think were fair and tighten others up than my predecessors have, since affirmative action\u2019s been around. But I have also worked hard to give people a chance to prove that they are qualified. Let me just give you some examples. We\u2019ve doubled the number of loans from the small business administration, tripled the number of loans to women business people, no one unqualified, everybody had to meet the standards. We\u2019ve opened 260,000 new jobs in the military to women since I\u2019ve been president. But the joint chiefs say we\u2019re stronger and more confident and solid than ever. Let me give you another example of what I mean. To me, Affirmative Action is making that extra effort. It\u2019s sort of like what Senator Dole did when he sponsored the Americans with Disabilities Act and said to certain stores, okay, you have to make it accessible to people in wheelchairs. We weren\u2019t guaranteeing anything, anybody anything except the chance to prove they were qualified, the chance to prove that they could do it.

The Economist magazine polled lots of economists, seven Nobel prize winners who said if this tax scheme passes, it will require huge cuts, 40 percent, in the environment and law enforcement and education.

Most important good things that happen in America happen in families. Just about every family I know, the main concern is how am I going to succeed at work and still do right by my children. Family medical leave has let 12 million families take a little time off for the birth of a child or a family illness without losing their job. I\u2019d like to see it expanded in two ways. I\u2019d like to say you can also take a little time off without losing your job to go to a regular parent-teacher conference or to go to a regular doctor\u2019s appointment with a family member. I\u2019d also like to see the overtime laws change so that we could have some more flex time so that at the discretion of the worker, the worker, if you earn overtime, you could decide when you want that time to be taken, in cash or in time with your family if you\u2019ve got a family problem. I never go anywhere, it seems like, where I don\u2019t meet somebody who has benefited from a Family Leave Law. In Longview, Texas the other day, I met a woman who was almost in tears because she had been able to keep her job while spending time with her husband who had cancer. One of the people who\u2019s here with me today met a woman in the airport saying her son, Jess was able to be present at the birth of her child because of the Family Leave Law.

I met a lady in Colorado Springs about seven weeks ago now. She had a small business with 63 employees. She finally gave it up. Why? Because of paperwork and regulation.

I\u2019m strongly in favor of a federal bill to repeal any gag rules on providers. In other words, I believe that doctors should not be able to be kicked out of managed care plans just because they tell the patients what they need and what more expensive care options might be.

Secondly, I think we need to look at making the elections more accessible. You know several states now are letting people vote over three weeks. A lot of people are busy and it\u2019s hard for them to just get there and vote. Third thing I think we need is more forums like this, which is one of the reasons I have so strongly supported campaign finance reform. Because if you want to cut the cost of campaigns, you have to open the airways, because what drives the cost of campaigns are the cost of advertising on television, radio, newspaper, mass mailing.

So I think we have to change the nature of politics. The last thing I think we should do is something I have been trying to do since I have been president, is every time I do something in a public way, I try to have a real American citizen there who is directly affected by it so that people can see the connection of what happens way across the country, in Washington with more police on the street, in San Diego, clean up the sewage here in San Diego, doubling the border guards here in Southern California, that there is a connection between what we do way back there and what we do here.

We all agreed it would be a pretty dull place. We should have more debates. Maybe we will have another debate on the economy. But I would just say this. This is the highest honor that I have ever had in my life, to think that somebody from Russell, Kansas, somebody who grew up living in a basement apartment, someone whose parents didn\u2019t finish high school, somebody who spent about 39 months in hospitals after World War II, someone who uses a buttonhook every day to get dressed. Somebody who understands that there\u2019re real Americans out there with real problems, whether soccer moms, or the single parents, the families or the seniors, or people with disabilities, whoever it may be. There are some very fundamental differences in this campaign. President Clinton opposes term limits, President Clinton opposes a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. President Clinton opposes voluntary prayer amendment. Opposes an amendment to protect the flag of the United States of America. People give their lives. Couple of service men here. They sacrifice, they give everything for America. We ought to protect the American flag with a constitutional amendment. But beyond that we need to address the economy. I will just say my time is running out here. It\u2019s a very proud moment for me. What I want the voters to do is to make a decision. And I want them to be proud of their vote in the years ahead. Proud that they voted for the right candidate. Proud that they voted hopefully for me. And I\u2019ll just make you one promise, my word is good. Democrats and Republicans said Bob Dole\u2019s word is good. I keep my word. I promise you the economy is going to get better. We\u2019re going to have a good economic package. We\u2019re going into the next century a better America. Thank you."}

Could have a chance to serve as president. First thing I want to say is thank you for giving me the chance to be president. This election is about two different visions about how we should go into the 21st Century. Would we be better off as I believe, working together to give each other the tools we need to make the most of our God-given potential, or are we better off saying, you\u2019re on your own?

This is a real important election. The world is changing dramatically in how we work and how we live, how we relate to each other, huge changes. And the decisions we make will have enormous practical consequences. So we\u2019ve talked about our responsibility tonight. I want to talk about your responsibility, and your responsibility. Your responsibility is to show up on November the 5th. Because you\u2019re going to decide whether we\u2019re going to balance the budget now, but protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. You will decide whether we\u2019re going to keep fighting crime with a Brady Bill, assault weapons and finish putting those 100,000 police. Whether we\u2019re going to move a million people from welfare to work. Whether we\u2019re going to give our families more protection for their kids against drugs and tobacco and gangs and guns. Whether we\u2019re going to give our children a world-class education. Where every eight-year-old can read. Every 12-year-old can log in on the Internet. Every 18-year-old can go to college.

That\u2019s because we believe in investing in education and in jobs. And we have to change in this country. You know, my wife, Hillary, gave me a book about a year ago in which the author defined insanity as just doing the same old thing over and over again and expecting a different result. We have got to have the courage to change. Experience is important, yes. I\u2019ve gotten a lot of good experience in dealing with ordinary people over the last year and month. I\u2019ve touched more people\u2019s lives and seen more heartbreak and hope, more pain and more promise, than anybody else who\u2019s run for president this year. I think the American people deserve better than they\u2019re getting. We have gone from first to thirteenth in wages in the world in the last twelve years, since Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan have been in. Personal income has dropped while people have worked harder. In the last four years, there have been twice as many bankruptcies as new jobs created. We need a new approach. The same old experience is not relevant. We\u2019re living in a new world after the Cold War, and what works in this new world is not trickle down, not government for the benefit of the privileged few, not tax and spend, but a commitment to invest in American jobs and American education, controlling American health care costs, and bringing the American people together. That is what works. And you can have the right kind of experience and the wrong kind of experience.

If you look at the cost of not keeping the peace in Europe, it would be exorbitant. We have reduced the number of troops that are deployed and going to be deployed. I have cut defense spending. And the reason we could do that is because of our fantastic success in winning the Cold War. We never would have got there if we had gone for the nuclear freeze crowd; we never would have got there if we had listened to those that wanted to cut defense spending. I think it is important that the US stay in Europe and continue to guarantee the peace. We simply cannot pull back. Now, when anybody has a spending program they want to spend money on at home, they say, well, let\u2019s cut money out of the Defense Dept. I will accept and have accepted the recommendations of 2 proven leaders, General Colin Powell and Secretary Dick Cheney. They feel that the levels we\u2019re operating at and the reductions that I have proposed are proper. And so I simply do not think we should go back to the isolation days and starting blaming foreigners. We are the sole remaining superpower, and we should be that. And we have a certain disproportionate responsibility. But I would ask the American people to understand that if we make imprudent cuts, if we go too far, we risk the peace. And I don\u2019t want to do that. I\u2019ve seen what it is like to see a war, to see the burdens of a war, and I don\u2019t want to see us make reckless cuts. Because of our programs we have been able to significantly cut defense spending. But let\u2019s not cut into the muscle, and let\u2019s not cut down our insurance policy, which is participation of American forces in NATO, the greatest peace- keeping organization ever made. Today you\u2019ve got problems in Europe, still bubbling along even though Europe\u2019s gone democracy\u2019s route. But we are there, and I think this insurance policy is necessary.

Have a 3rd task force on new industries of the future to make sure we nail those for our country and they don\u2019t wind up in Europe and Asia. Convert from 19th to 21st century capitalism. See, we have an adversarial relationship between government and business. Our international competitors that are cleaning our plate have an intelligent relationship between government and business, and a supportive relationship. Then have another task force on crime because, next to jobs, our people are concerned about their safety. Health care, schools\u2013one on the debt and deficit. And finally in that 90- day period before the inauguration, put together the framework for the town hall and give the American people a Christmas present. Show them by Christmas the first cut at these plans. By the time Congress comes into session to go to work, have those plans ready to go in front of Congress. Then get off to a flying start in \u201993 to execute these plans. Now, there are people in this room and people on this stage who\u2019ve been in meetings when I would sit there and say, \u201cIs this the one we\u2019re going to talk about or do something about?\u201d Well, obviously, my orientation is let\u2019s go do it. Now, put together your plans by Christmas, be ready to go when Congress goes, nail these things. Small business\u2013you\u2019ve got to have capital, you\u2019ve got to credit, and many of them need mentors or coaches. And we can create more jobs there in a hurry than any other place."}

Believe it or not folks, you can\u2019t ship it all overseas, you\u2019ve got to make it here. And you can\u2019t convert from potato chips to airplanes in an emergency. See, Willow Run could be converted from cars to airplanes in World War II because it was here. We\u2019ve got to make things here. You can\u2019t ship them overseas anymore. I hope we can talk more about that. Second thing, on priorities. We\u2019ve got to help Russia succeed in its revolution and all of its republics. When we think of Russia, remember we\u2019re thinking of many countries, now. We\u2019ve got to help them. That\u2019s pennies on the dollar compared to renewing the cold war. Third, we\u2019ve got all kinds of agreements on paper, and some that are being executed on getting rid of nuclear warheads. Russia and its republics are out of control or at best in weak control right now. It\u2019s a very unstable situation. You\u2019ve got every rich Middle Eastern country over there trying to buy nuclear weapons. As you well know. And that will lead to another five star migraine headache down the road. We really need to nail down the big intercontinental ballistic missiles, the ones that can hit us from Russia. And we\u2019ve focused on the tactical. We\u2019ve made real progress there. We\u2019ve got some agreement on the nuclear, but we don\u2019t have those things put away yet. The sooner the better. So, in terms of priorities, we\u2019ve got to be financially strong. Number two, we\u2019ve got to take care of this missile situation and try to get the nuclear war behind us and give this thing very high priority. And number three, we need to help and support Russia and the republics in every possible way to become democratic capitalistic societies, and not just sit back and let those countries continue in turmoil. Because they could go back worse than things used to be. And believe me there are a lot of old boys in the K.G.B. and the military that liked it better the way it used to be."}

I might say to Mr. Perot, I can understand why you might have missed it, because there\u2019s so much fascination with trivia, but I worked out a deal with Boris Yeltsin to eliminate, get rid of entirely, the most destabilizing weapons of all, the SS-18, the intercontinental ballistic missile. I mean, that\u2019s been done. And thank God, it has, because the parents of these young people around here go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war. We made dramatic progress.

And we\u2019re more respected because of the way we have conducted ourselves. We didn\u2019t listen to the nuclear freeze crowd. We said, \u201cPeace through strength,\u201d and it worked and the cold war is over. And America understands that. But we\u2019re so, turned so inward we don\u2019t understand the global picture.

But when you go to put somebody else\u2019s son or daughter into war, I think you got to be a little bit careful and you have to be sure that there\u2019s a military plan that can do this. You have ancient ethnic rivalries that have cropped up as Yugoslavia\u2019s dissolved or getting dissolved, and it isn\u2019t going to be solved by sending in the 82nd Airborne, and I\u2019m not going to do that as commander-in-chief.

America has a lot of families that are in trouble today. There\u2019s been a lot of talk about family values in this campaign. I know a lot about that. I was born to a widowed mother who gave me family values, and grandparents. I\u2019ve seen the family values of my people in Arkansas. I\u2019ve seen the family values of all these people in America who are out there killing themselves working harder for less in a country that\u2019s had the worst economic years in 50 years and the first decline in industrial production ever. I think the president owes it to family values to show that he values America\u2019s families, whether they\u2019re people on welfare you\u2019re trying to move from welfare to work, the working poor whom I think deserve a tax break to lift them above poverty if they\u2019ve got a child in the house and working 40 hours a week, working families who deserve a fair tax system and the opportunity for constant retraining; they deserve a strong economy. And I think they deserve a family and medical leave act. Seventy-two other nations have been able to do it. Mr. Bush vetoed it twice because he says we can\u2019t do something seventy-two other countries do, even though there was a small business exemption. So with all the talk about family values, I know about family values \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t be here without them. The best expression of my family values is that tonight\u2019s my 17th wedding anniversary, and I\u2019d like to close my question by just wishing my wife a happy anniversary, and thank you, my daughter, for being here."}

We are all in this together. We ought to love one another because united teams win and divided teams lose. And if we can\u2019t love one another, we ought to get along with one another.

Now again, the White House is a bully pulpit. I think whoever is in the White House should just make it absolutely unconscionable and inexcusable, and if anybody\u2019s in the middle of a speech at, you know, one of these conventions, I would expect the candidate to go out and lift him off the stage if he starts preaching hate \u2014 because we don\u2019t have time for it.

We have got to unite and pull together, and there\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t do. But if we sit around blowing all this energy out the window on racial strife and hatred, we are stuck with a sure loser because we have been a melting pot.

We have increased funding for AIDS. We\u2019ve doubled it on research and on every other aspect of it. My request for this year was $4.9 billion for AIDS \u2014 ten times as much per AIDS victim as per cancer victim. I think that we\u2019re showing the proper compassion and concern. So I can\u2019t tell you where it\u2019s coming from, but I am very much concerned about AIDS and I believe that we\u2019ve got the best researchers in the world out there at NIH working the problem. We\u2019re funding them \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 I wish there was more money \u2014 but we\u2019re funding them far more than any time in the past, and we\u2019re going to keep on doing that.

Call me, let me know.\u201d He went to one meeting, and then we heard that he was stepping down. So he\u2019s replaced by Mary Fisher who electrified the Republican Convention by talking about the compassion and the concern that we feel. It was a beautiful moment and I think she\u2019ll do a first-class job on that commission. So I think the appeal is yes, we care. And the other thing is part of AIDS \u2014 it\u2019s one of the few diseases where behavior matters. And I once called on somebody, \u201cWell, change your behavior. Is the behavior you\u2019re using prone to cause AIDS? Change the behavior.\u201d Next thing I know, one of these ACT UP groups is out saying, \u201cBush ought to change his behavior.\u201d You can\u2019t talk about it rationally. The extremes are hurting the AIDS cause. To go into a Catholic mass in a beautiful cathedral in New York under the cause of helping in AIDS and start throwing condoms around in the mass, I\u2019m sorry, I think it sets back the cause. We cannot move to the extreme. We\u2019ve got to care. We\u2019ve got to continue everything we can at the federal and the local level. Barbara I think is doing a superb job in destroying the myth about AIDS. And all of us are in this fight together, all of us care. Do not go to the extreme."}

So I would think we can expedite the problem there. Let me go back a minute to racial divisiveness. The all- time low in our country was the Judge Thomas-Anita Hill hearings, and those senators ought to be hanging their heads in shame for what they did there. 2nd thing, there are not many times in your life when you get to talk to a whole country.

Mr. Bush has said some very compelling things tonight that don\u2019t quite square with the record. He was president for 3 years before he proposed a health care plan that still hasn\u2019t been sent to Congress in total; three years before an economic plan, and he still didn\u2019t say tonight that that tax bill he vetoed raised taxes only on the rich and gave the rest of you a break \u2014 but he vetoed it anyway.

In the Oval Office, you can\u2019t predict what kind of crisis is going to come up. You have to make tough calls. You can\u2019t be on one hand this way and one hand another. You can\u2019t take different positions on these difficult issues. And then you need a philosophical \u2014 I\u2019d call it a philosophical underpinning. Mine for foreign affairs is democracy and freedom, and look at the dramatic changes around the world. The Cold War is over. The Soviet Union is no more and we\u2019re working with a democratic country. Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the Baltics are free. Take a look at the Middle East. We had to stand up against a tyrant. The US came together as we haven\u2019t in many, many years. And we kicked this man out of Kuwait. And in the process, as a result of that will and that decision and that toughness, we now have ancient enemies talking peace in the Middle East. Nobody would have dreamed it possible. And I think the biggest dividend of making these tough calls is the fact that we are less afraid of nuclear war. Every parent out there has much less worry that their kids are going to be faced with nuclear holocaust. All this is good. On the domestic side, what we must do is have change that empowers people \u2014 not change for the sake of change, tax and spend. We don\u2019t need to do that any more. What we need to do is empower people. We need to invest and save. We need to do better in education. We need to do better in job retraining. We need to expand our exports, and they\u2019re going very, very well, indeed. And we need to strengthen the American family. I hope as president that I\u2019ve earned your trust. I\u2019ve admitted it when I make a mistake, but then I go on and help, try to solve the problems. I hope I\u2019ve earned your trust because a lot of being president is about trust and character.

This is 1992, Bill Clinton is running against President George Bush. There are 2 things that I\u2019m going to stress during this debate: one, Bill Clinton\u2019s economic plan and his agenda will make matters much, much worse \u2014 he will raise your taxes, he will increase spending, he will make government bigger, jobs will be lost; second, Bill Clinton does not have the strength nor the character to be president of the US. Let us look at the agendas. President Bush wants to hold the line on taxes, Bill Clinton wants to raise taxes. President Bush is for a balanced budget amendment, Bill Clinton is opposed to it. We want to reform the legal system because it\u2019s too costly, Bill Clinton wants the status quo. We want to reform the health care system, Bill Clinton wants to ration health care. Bill Clinton wants to empower government, we want to empower people. In St. Louis, Missouri, in June of this year, Bill Clinton said this - \u201cAmerica is the mockery of the world.\u201d He is wrong. At some time during these next 4 years there is going to be a crisis \u2014 there will be an international crisis. I can\u2019t tell you where it\u2019s going to be, I can\u2019t even tell you the circumstances \u2014 but it will happen. We need a president who has the experience, who has been tested, who has the integrity and qualifications to handle the crisis. The president has been tested, the president has the integrity and the character. The choice is yours. You need to have a president you can trust. Can you really trust Bill Clinton?"}

Senator Gore referred to us being elected to the Congress together in 1976. I\u2019ve done the job. I\u2019ve done many things for the president. But even as vice president you never know exactly what your role is going to be from time to time, and let me just give you an example of where I was tested under fire and in a crisis. President Bush was flying to Malta in 1989 to meet with President Gorbachev. It was the first meeting between President Bush and President Gorbachev. They had known each other before. A coup broke out in the Philippines. I had to go to the situation room. I had to assemble the president\u2019s advisers. I talked to President Aquino. I made the recommendation to the president. The president made the decision, the coup was suppressed, democracy continued in the Philippines, the situation was ended. I\u2019ve been there. And I\u2019ll tell you one other thing that qualifies you for being president \u2014 and it\u2019s this, Hal \u2014 you\u2019ve got to stand up for what you believe in. And nobody has ever criticized me for not having strong beliefs."}

The experience that George Bush and Dan Quayle have been talking about includes the worst economic performance since the Great Depression. Unemployment is up, personal income is down, bankruptcies are up, housing starts are down. How long can we continue with trickle-down economics when the record of failure is so abundantly clear? Discussions of the vice presidency tend sometimes to focus on the crisis during which a vice president is thrust into the Oval Office, and indeed, one-3rd of the vice presidents who have served have been moved into the White House. But the teamwork and partnership beforehand \u2014 and hopefully that situation never happens \u2014 how you work together is critically important. The way we work together in this campaign is one sample. Now I\u2019d like to say in response to Vice President Quayle- -he talked about Malta and the Philippines. George Bush has concentrated on every other country in the world. When are you guys going to start worrying about our people here in the US of America and get our country moving again?"}

Bill Clinton and I have a detailed 5-year budget plan to create good jobs, cut the budget deficit in half, and eliminate the investment deficit in order to get our economy moving forward again. We have a $20-billion infrastructure fund to create a nationwide network of high-speed rail, for example, and what are called information superhighways to open up a whole universe of knowledge for our young people and to help our universities and companies that rely on new advances in the information revolution. We also have tax incentives for investment in job-creating activities, not the kind of encouragement for short-term rip-offs like the proposal that we have had from George Bush. But I want to return and say one more time - you have used our tax dollars to subsidize the recruitment of US companies to move overseas and throw Americans out of work. In Decaturville, Tennessee, not very far from my home, a factory was shut down right there when they were solicited by officials paid with US taxpayers\u2019 money, and then the replacement workers in a foreign country were trained with our tax dollars and then their imports were subsidized coming back into the US.

What I have called upon is a cooperative effort by the US and Europe and Asia to work together in opening up new markets throughout the world for the new technologies that are necessary in order to reconcile the imperatives of economic progress with the imperatives of environmental protection. Take Mexico City for an example. They are shutting down factories right now, not because of their economy, but because they\u2019re choking to death on the air pollution. They\u2019re banning automobiles some days of the week. Now what they want is not new laser-guided missile systems. What they want are new engines and new factories and new products that don\u2019t pollute the air and the water, but nevertheless allow them to have a decent standard of living for their people. Last year 35 % of our exports went to developing countries, countries where the population is expanding worldwide by as much as one billion people every ten years. We cannot stick our heads in the sand and pretend that we don\u2019t face a global environmental crisis, nor should we assume that it\u2019s going to cost jobs. Quite the contrary. We are going to be able to create jobs as Japan and Germany are planning to do right now, if we have the guts to leave. Now earlier we heard about the auto industry and the timber industry. There have been 250,000 jobs lost in the automobile industry during the Reagan-Bush-Quayle years. There have been tens of thousands of jobs lost in the timber industry. What they like to do is point the finger of blame with one hand and hand out pink slips with the other hand. They\u2019ve done a poor job both with the economy and the environment.

Sometimes it seems deceptively easy to continue with the old habits even when they\u2019re no longer good for us. Trickle-down economics simply does not work. We have had an increase in all of the things that should be decreasing. Everything that should have been increasing has been going down. We have got to change direction. Bill Clinton offers a new approach. He has been named by the other 49 governors, Republicans and Democrats alike, as the best and most effective governor in the entire US of America. He\u2019s moved 17,000 people off the welfare rolls and on to payrolls. He has introduced innovations in health care and education, and again, he has led the nation for the last 2 years in a row in the creation of jobs in the private sector.

I\u2019d like to use this closing statement to talk to you about a few people that I have met in these last 4 years. I think of a woman in Chicago when I was talking to parents about education where she stood up and said I\u2019m sick and tired of these schools in this city being nothing but a factory for failure. And that\u2019s why we support choice in education. I was in Beaumont, Texas, and met with small business people, and they wanted to reform the civil justice system because they think our legal system costs too much and there\u2019s too much of a delay in getting an answer. I was in Middletown, Ohio, talking to a welfare woman, where she said I want to go back to work and I had a job offered to me but I\u2019m not going to take it because I have 2 children at home and the job that is offered to me doesn\u2019t have health insurance. Under President Bush\u2019s health care reform package that woman won\u2019t have to make a choice about going back to work or health care for her children, because she\u2019ll have both. I was in Vilnius, Lithuania, Independence Square, speaking to 10,000 people in the middle of winter. Hundreds of people came up to me and said - God bless America. Yes, in the next 4 years, as I said, somewhere, some time, there\u2019s going to be a crisis, and you need to have a president that is qualified, has the experience, and has been tested. Not one time during this evening, during 90 minutes, did Al Gore tell us why Bill Clinton is qualified to be president. He never answered my charges that Bill Clinton has trouble telling the truth. The choice is yours. The American people should demand that their president tell the truth. Do you really believe \u2014 do you really believe Bill Clinton will tell the truth? And do you, do you trust Bill Clinton to be your president?"}

And if indeed all the jobs were going to move south because there are lower wages, there are lower wages now and they haven\u2019t done that. And so I have just negotiated with the president of Mexico the North American Free Trade Agreement \u2014 and the prime minister of Canada, I might add \u2014 and I want to have more of these free trade agreements, because export jobs are increasing far faster than any jobs that may have moved overseas. That\u2019s a scare tactic, because it\u2019s not that many. But any one that\u2019s here, we want to have more jobs here. And the way to do that is to increase our exports. Some believe in protection. I don\u2019t; I believe in free and fair trade, and that\u2019s the thing that saved us. So I will keep on as president trying to get a successful conclusion to the GATT Round, the big Uruguay Round of trade which will really open up markets for our agriculture particularly. I want to continue to work after we get this NAFTA agreement ratified this coming year. I want to get one with Eastern Europe; I want to get one with Chile. And free and fair trade is the answer, not protection. And, as I say, we\u2019ve had tough economic times, and it\u2019s exports that have saved us, exports that have built."}

The trick is to expand our export base and to expand trade on terms that are fair to us. It is true that our exports to Mexico, for example, have gone up and our trade deficit has gone down; it\u2019s also true that just today a record high trade deficit was announced with Japan. So what is the answer? Let me just mention three things very quickly. Number one, make sure that other countries are as open to our markets as our markets are to them, and, if they\u2019re not, have measures on the books that don\u2019t take forever and a day to implement. Number two, change the tax code. There are more deductions in the tax code for shutting plants down and moving overseas than there are for modernizing plant and equipment here. Our competitors don\u2019t do that. Emphasize and subsidize modernizing plant and equipment here, not moving plants overseas. Number three, stop the federal government\u2019s program that now gives low-interest loans and job training funds to companies that will actually shut down and move to other countries, but we won\u2019t do the same thing for plants that stay here. So more trade but on fair terms \u2014 and favor investment in America."}

I was down in Texas taking care of business, tending to my family. This situation got so bad that I decided I\u2019d better get into it. The American people asked me to get into it.

I\u2019m here tonight for these young people up here in the balcony from this college. When I was a young man, when I got out of the Navy I had multiple job offers. Young people with high grades can\u2019t get a job. People \u2014 the 18- to 24-year-old high school graduates 10 years ago were making more than they are now. In other words, we were down to 18% of them were making \u2014 18- to 24-year- olds were making less than $12,000. Now that\u2019s up to 40%. And what\u2019s happened in the meantime? The dollar\u2019s gone through the floor. Now, whose fault is that? Not the Democrats. Not the Republicans. Somewhere out there there\u2019s an extraterrestrial that\u2019s doing this to us, I guess. And everybody says they take responsibility. Somebody somewhere has to take responsibility for this. Put it to you bluntly, American people. If you want me to be your president, we\u2019re going to face our problems. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll deal with our problems, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll solve our problems. We\u2019ll down our debt. We\u2019ll pass on the American dream to our children, and I will not leave our children a situation that they have today. When I was a boy it took 2 generations to double the standard of living.

I think you have to look at it. I think that has to be a part of a candidate for president or being president. In terms of programs, I\u2019ve submitted, what, 4 different budgets to the US Congress in great detail. It\u2019s so heavy they\u2019d give you a broken back. And everything in there says what I am for. Now I\u2019ve come out with a new agenda for America\u2019s renewal, a plan that I believe really will help stimulate the growth of this economy. My record on world affairs is pretty well known because I\u2019ve been president for 4 years, so I feel I\u2019ve been talking issues. You know, nobody likes who shot John, but I think the first negative campaign run in this election was by Governor Clinton, and I\u2019m not going to sit there and be a punching bag; I\u2019m going to stand up and say, hey, listen, here\u2019s my side of it. But character is an important part of the equation. The other night Governor Clinton raised my \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you saw the debate the other night. You did \u2014 suffered through that? Well, he raised the question of my father \u2014 it was a good line, well rehearsed and well delivered. But he raised the question of my father and said, well, your father, Prescott Bush, was against McCarthy, you should be ashamed of yourself, McCarthyism. I remember something my dad told me \u2014 I was 18 years old going to Penn Station to go on into the Navy, and he said write your mother \u2014 which I faithfully did; he said serve your country \u2014 my father was an honor, duty and country man; and he said tell the truth. And I\u2019ve tried to do that in public life, all through it. That says something about character. My argument with Governor Clinton \u2014 you can call it mud wrestling, but I think it\u2019s fair to put it in focus is \u2014 I am deeply troubled by someone who demonstrates and organizes demonstration in a foreign land when his country\u2019s at war. Probably a lot of kids here disagree with me. But that\u2019s what I feel. That\u2019s what I feel passionately about. I\u2019m thinking of Ross Perot\u2019s running mate sitting in the jail. How would he feel about it? But maybe that\u2019s generational. I don\u2019t know. But the big argument I have with the governor on this is this taking different positions on different issues \u2014 trying to be one thing to one person here that\u2019s opposing the NAFTA agreement and then for it \u2014 what we call waffling. And I do think that you can\u2019t turn the White House into the Waffle House. You\u2019ve got to say what you\u2019re for and you\u2019ve got to \u2014"}

This is facts \u2014 that would have given investment tax credits and other incentives to reinvest in our cities, in our country. But it asked the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more. Mr. Perot wants to do the same thing. I agree with him. I mean, we agree with that. But let me tell you specifically what my plan does. My plan would dedicate $20 billion a year in each of the next 4 years for investments in new transportation, communications, environmental clean-ups and new technologies for the 21st century. And we would target it especially in areas that have been either depressed or which have lost a lot of defense related jobs. There are 200,000 people in California, for example, who have lost their defense related jobs. They ought to be engaged in making high speed rail. They ought to be engaged in breaking ground in other technologies, doing waste recycling, clean water technology and things of that kind. We can create millions of jobs in these new technologies- -more than we\u2019re going to lose in defense \u2014 if we target it. But we\u2019re investing a much smaller percentage of our income in the things you just asked about than all of our major competitors, and our wealth growth is going down as a result of it. It\u2019s making the country poorer, which is why I answered the gentleman the way I did before. We have to both bring down the deficit and get our economy going through these kinds of investments in order to get the kind of wealth and jobs and incomes we need in America."}

So let me try to answer you in this way. Let\u2019s start with a premise. We spend 30% more of our income than any nation on earth on health care, and yet we insure fewer people. We have 35 million people without any insurance at all \u2014 and I see them all the time. A hundred thousand Americans a month have lost their health insurance just in the last 4 years. So if you analyze where we\u2019re out of line with other countries, you come up with the following conclusions. Number one, we spend at least $60 billion a year on insurance, administrative cost, bureaucracy, and government regulation that wouldn\u2019t be spent in any other nation. So we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everybody. Employers would cover their employees, government would cover the unemployed. Number 2, I think you have to take on specifically the insurance companies and require them to make some significant change in the way they rate people in the big community pools. I think you have to tell the pharmaceutical companies they can\u2019t keep raising drug prices at three times the rate of inflation. I think you have to take on medical fraud. I think you have to help doctors stop practicing defensive medicine. I\u2019ve recommended that our doctors be given a set of national practice guidelines and that if they follow those guidelines that raises the presumption that they didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I think you have to have a system of primary and preventive clinics in our inner cities and our rural areas so people can have access to health care. The key is to control the cost and maintain the quality. To do that you need a system of managed competition where all of us are covered in big groups and we can choose our doctors and our hospitals, a wide range, but there is an incentive to control costs. And I think there has to be \u2014 I think Mr. Perot and I agree on this, there has to be a national commission of health care providers and health care consumers that set ceilings to keep health costs in line with inflation, plus population growth. Now, let me say, some people say we can\u2019t do this but Hawaii does it. They cover 98% of their people and their insurance premiums are much cheaper than the rest of America, and so does Rochester, New York. They now have a plan to cover everybody and their premiums are two-thirds of the rest of the country. This is very important. It\u2019s a big human problem and a devastating economic problem for America, and I\u2019m going to send a plan to do this within the first 100 days of my presidency. It\u2019s terribly important."}

Barbara\u2019s sitting over here and I \u2014 but what I have proposed, 10% cut, downsize the government, and we can get that done. She asked a question, I think, is whether the health care profession was to blame. No. One thing to blame is these malpractice lawsuits. They\u2019re breaking the system. It costs $20-25 billion a year, and I want to see those outrageous claims capped. Doctors don\u2019t dare to deliver babies sometimes because they\u2019re afraid that somebody\u2019s going to sue them. People don\u2019t dare \u2014 medical practitioners, to help somebody along the highway that are hurt because they\u2019re afraid that some lawyer\u2019s going to come along and get a big lawsuit. So you can\u2019t blame the practitioners for the health problem. And my program is this. Keep the government as far out of it as possible, make insurance available to the poorest of the poor, through vouchers, next range in the income bracket, through tax credits, and get on about the business of pooling insurance. A great big company can buy \u2014 Ross has got a good-sized company, been very successful. He can buy insurance cheaper than Mom and Pop\u2019s store on the corner. But if those Mom and Pop stores all get together and pool, they too can bring the cost of insurance down. So I want to keep the quality of health care. That means keep government out of it. I want to do \u2014 I don\u2019t like this idea of these boards. It all sounds to me like you\u2019re going to have some government setting price. I want competition and I want to pool the insurance and take care of it that way and have \u2014 oh, here\u2019s the other point. I think medical care should go with the person. If you leave a business, I think your insurance should go with you to some other business. You shouldn\u2019t be worrying if you get a new job as to whether that\u2019s gonna \u2014 and part of our plan is to make it what they call portable \u2014 big word, but that means if you\u2019re working for the Jones Company and you go to the Smith Company, your insurance goes with you. I think it\u2019s a good program. I\u2019m really excited about getting it done, too."}

Then, if the plans are huge and complex like health care, I would urge you to implement pilot programs. Like the old carpenter says measure twice, cut once. Let\u2019s make sure this thing\u2019s as good as we all think it is at the end of the meeting. Then finally, our government passes laws and freezes the plan in concrete. Anybody that\u2019s ever built a successful business will tell you you optimize, optimize, optimize after you\u2019ve put something into effect. The reason Medicare and Medicaid are a mess is we froze them. Everybody knows how to fix them. There are people all over the federal government, if they could just touch it with a screwdriver, could fix it. Now, back over here. See, we\u2019ve got a $4 trillion debt and only in America would you have $2.8 trillion of it or 70% of it financed 5 years or less. Now, that\u2019s another thing for you to think about when you go home tonight. You don\u2019t finance long-term debt with short-term money. Why did our government do it? To get the interest rates down. A 1% increase in interest rates in that $2.8 trillion is $28 billion a year. Now, when you look at what Germany pays for money and what we don\u2019t pay for money, you realize there\u2019s quite a spread, right, and you realize this is a temporary thing and there\u2019s going to be another sucking sound that runs our deficit through the roof. You know, and everybody\u2019s ducking it so I\u2019m gonna say it, that we are not letting that surplus stay in the bank. We are not investing that surplus like a pension fund. We are spending that surplus to make the deficit look smaller to you than it really is. Now, that \u2014 put you in jail in corporate America if you kept books that way but in government it\u2019s just kind of the way things are. That\u2019s because it comes at you, not from you.

We\u2019ve got to pay it off and build money to renew it- -spend money to renew it, and that\u2019s going to take a growing, expanding job base. That is priority one in this country.

(Laughter.) Let me say first of all, I want to answer your specific question but first of all, we all agree that there should be a growing economy. What you have to decide is who\u2019s got the best economic plan. And we all have ideas out there, and Mr. Bush has a record. So I don\u2019t want you to read my lips and I sure don\u2019t want you to read his. I do hope you will read our plans. Now, specifically, one, on Medicare, it is not true that everyone knows how to fix it. There are different ideas \u2014 the Bush plan, the Perot plan, the Clinton \u2014 we have different ideas. I am convinced, having studied health care for a year hard and talking to hundreds and hundreds of people all across America, that you cannot control the cost of Medicare until you control the cost of private health care and public health care, with managed competition, ceiling on cost, and radical reorganization of the insurance markets. You\u2019ve got to do that; we got to get those costs down. Number 2, with regard to Social Security, that program \u2014 a lot of you may not know this \u2014 it produces a $70 billion surplus a year. Social Security is in surplus $70 billion. Six increases in the payroll tax \u2014 that means people with incomes of $51,000 a year or less pay a disproportionally high share of the federal tax burden, which is why I want some middle-class tax relief. What do we have to do? By the time the century turns, we have got to have our deficit under control, we have to work out of so that surplus is building up so when the baby boomers like me retire, we\u2019re okay. Number 3, on the pension funds, I don\u2019t know as much about it, but I will say this. What I would do is to bring in the pension experts of the country, take a look at it, and strengthen the pension requirements further, because it\u2019s not just enough to have the guarantee. We had a guarantee on the S&Ls, right? We had a guarantee \u2014 and what happened? You picked up a $500-billion bill because of the dumb way the federal government deregulated it. So I think we are going to have to change and strengthen the pension requirements on private retirement plans."}

Because the question you ask is important. The end of the Cold War brings an incredible opportunity for change. Winds of freedom blowing around the world, Russia demilitarizing. And it also requires us to maintain some continuity \u2014 some bipartisan American commitment to certain principles. And I would just say there are three things that I would like to say \u2014 number one \u2014 we do have to maintain the world\u2019s strongest defense. We may differ about what the elements of that are. I think that defense needs to be \u2014 with fewer people in permanent armed services but with greater mobility on the land, in the air and on the sea, with a real dedication to continuing development of high technology weaponry and well trained people. I think we\u2019re going to have to work to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Got to keep going until all those nuclear weapons in Russia are gone and the other republics. Number 2, if you don\u2019t rebuild the economic strength of this country at home, we won\u2019t be a superpower. We can\u2019t have any more instances like what happened when Mr. Bush went to Japan and the Japanese prime minister said he felt sympathy for our country. We have to be the strongest economic power in the world. That\u2019s what got me into this race, so we could rebuild the American economy. And number three, we need to be a force for freedom and democracy and we need to use our unique position to support freedom, whether it\u2019s in Haiti or in China or in any other place, wherever the seeds of freedom are sprouting. We can\u2019t impose it, but we need to nourish it and that\u2019s the kind of thing that I would do as president \u2014 follow those three commitments into the future."}

Seventy percent of my state\u2019s money goes to the public schools, and I was really honored when Time magazine said that our schools have shown more improvement than any other state in the country except one other \u2014 they named 2 states showing real strides forward in the 80s. So I care a lot about this, and I\u2019ve spent countless hours in schools. But let me start with what you said. I agree with some of what Mr. Bush said, but it\u2019s nowhere near enough. We live in a world where what you earn depends on what you can learn, where the average 18- year-old will change jobs 8 times in a lifetime and where none of us can promise any of you that what you now do for a living is absolutely safe from now on. Nobody running can promise that, there\u2019s too much change in the world. So what should we do? Let me reel some things off real quick, because you said you wanted specifics. Number one, under my program we would provide matching funds to states to teach everybody with a job to read in the next 5 years and give everybody with a job the chance to get a high school diploma, in big places on the job. Number 2, we would provide 2-year apprenticeship programs to high school graduates who don\u2019t go to college. And community colleges are on the job. Number three, we\u2019d open the doors to college education to high school graduates without regard to income. They could borrow the money and pay it back as a percentage of their income or with a couple of years of service to our nation here at home. Number 4, we would fully fund the Head Start program to get little kids off to a good start. And, 5, I would have an aggressive program of school reform, more choices \u2014 I favor public schools or these new charter schools \u2014 we can talk about that if you want. I don\u2019t think we should spend tax money on private schools. But I favor public school choice, and I favor radical decentralization in giving more power to better-trained principals and teachers with parent councils to control their schools. Those things would revolutionize American education and take us to the top economically."}

And the first word you need to say in every city and state, and just draw a line in the sand, is public schools exist for the benefit of the children. You\u2019re going to see a lot of people fall over it, because any time you\u2019re spending $199 billion dollars a year, somebody\u2019s getting it. And the children get lost in the process. So that\u2019s step one. Keep in mind in 1960, when our schools were the envy of the world, we were spending $16 billion on them; now we spend more than any other nation in the world \u2014 199 billion a year \u2014 and rank at the bottom of the industrialized world in terms of education achievement. One more time you\u2019ve bought a front-row box seat and got a third-rate performance. This is a government that is not serving you. By and large it should be local \u2014 the more local, the better. Interesting phenomenon: small towns have good schools, big cities have terrible schools. The best people in a small town will serve on the school board; you get into big cities, it\u2019s political patronage, stepping stones \u2014 you get the job, give your relatives a janitor\u2019s job at $57,000 a year, more than the teachers make, and with luck they clean the cafeteria once a week. Now, you\u2019re paying for that. Those schools belong to you. And we put up with that. Now, as long as we put up with that, that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to get. And these folks are just dividing up 199 billion bucks and the children get lost. If I could wish for one thing for great public schools, it would be a strong family unit in every home \u2014 nothing will ever replace that. You say, well, gee, what are you going to do about that? Well, the White House is a bully pulpit, and I think we ought to be pounding on the table every day. There\u2019s nothing \u2014 the most efficient unit of government the world will ever know is a strong loving family unit. Next thing. You need small schools, not big schools. In a little school everybody is somebody; individualism is very important. These big factories? Everybody told me they were cost-effective. I did a study on it; they\u2019re cost- ineffective. 5000 students \u2014 why is a high school that big? One reason. Sooner or later you get 11 more boys that can run like the devil that weigh 250 pounds and they might win district. Now, that has nothing to do with learning. Secondly, across Texas, typically half of the school day was non-academic pursuits \u2014 in one place it was 35%. In Texas you could have unlimited absences to go to livestock shows. Found a boy \u2014 excuse me, but this gives the flavor \u2014 a boy in Houston kept a chicken in the bathtub in downtown Houston and missed 65 days going to livestock shows. Finally had to come back to school, the chicken lost its feathers. That\u2019s the only way we got him back. (Laughter) Now, that\u2019s your tax money being wasted. Now, neighborhood schools. It is terrible to bus tiny little children across town. And it is particularly terrible to take poor tiny little children and wait until the first grade and bus them across town to Mars, where the children know their numbers, know their letters, have had every advantage. At the end of the first day, that little child wants out. I\u2019ll close on this. You\u2019ve got to have world class teachers, world class books. If you ever got close to how textbooks were selected, you wouldn\u2019t want to go back the second day. I don\u2019t have time to tell you the stories."}

Since I suggested this format I hope it\u2019s been good for all of you. I really tried to be faithful to your request that we answer the questions specifically and pointedly. I thought I owed that to you and I respect you for being here and for the impact you\u2019ve had on making this a more positive experience. These problems are not easy. They\u2019re not going to be solved overnight. But I want you to think about just 2 or 3 things. First of all, the people of my state have let me be their governor for 12 years because I made commitments to 2 things \u2014 more jobs and better schools. Our schools are now better. Our children get off to a better start from pre-school programs and smaller classes in the early grades, and we have one of the most aggressive adult education programs in the country. We talked about that. This year my state ranks first in the country in job growth, 4th in manufacturing in job growth, 4th in income growth, 4th in the decline of poverty. I\u2019m proud of that. It happened because I could work with people \u2014 Republicans and Democrats. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve had 24 retired generals and admirals, hundreds of business people, many of them Republican, support this campaign. You have to decide whether you want to change or not. We do not need 4 more years of an economic theory that doesn\u2019t work. We\u2019ve had 12 years of trickle down economics. It\u2019s time to put the American people first, to invest and grow this economy. I\u2019m the only person here who\u2019s ever balanced a government budget and I\u2019ve presented 12 of them and cut spending repeatedly. But you cannot just get there by balancing the budget. We\u2019ve got to grow the economy by putting people first \u2014 real people like you. I got into this race because I did not want my child to grow up to be part of the first generation of Americans to do worse than her parents. We\u2019re better than that. We can do better than that. I want to make America as great as it can be and I ask for your help in doing it. Thank you very much."}

The wealthiest Americans have been taxed much less, even though their incomes have gone up. Middle-class people will have their fair share of changing to do, and many challenges to face, including the challenge of becoming constantly re-educated. But my plan is a departure from trickle-down economics, just cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans and getting out of the way. It\u2019s also a departure from tax-and- spend economics, because you can\u2019t tax and divide an economy that isn\u2019t growing. I propose an American version of what works in other countries \u2014 I think we can do it better: invest and grow. I believe we can increase investment and reduce the deficit at the same time, if we not only ask the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their share; we also provide over $100 billion in tax relief, in terms of incentives for new plants, new small businesses, new technologies, new housing, and for middle class families; and we have $140 billion of spending cuts. Invest and grow. Raise some more money, spend the money on tax incentives to have growth in the private sector, take the money from the defense cuts and reinvest it in new transportation and communications and environmental clean-up systems. This will work. On this, as on so many other issues, I have a fundamental difference from the present administration. I don\u2019t believe trickle down economics will work. Unemployment is up. Most people are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago. I think we can do better if we have the courage to change."}

If you take a patient into the hospital that\u2019s bleeding arterially, step one is to stop the bleeding. And we are bleeding arterially. There\u2019s only one way out of this, and that is to stop the deterioration of our job base, to have a growing, expanding job base, to give us the tax base \u2014 see, balancing the budget is not nearly as difficult as paying off the $4 trillion debt and leaving our children the American dream intact. We have spent their money. We\u2019ve got to pay it back. This is going to take fair, shared sacrifice. My plan balances the budget within 6 years. We didn\u2019t do it faster than that because we didn\u2019t want to disrupt the economy. We gave it off to a slow start and a fast finish to give the economy time to recover. But we faced it and we did it, and we believe it\u2019s fair, shared sacrifice. The one thing I have done is lay it squarely on the table in front of the American people. You\u2019ve had a number of occasions to see in detail what the plan is, and at least you\u2019ll understand it.

For one thing, let me just follow up here. I disagree with Mr. Perot that the answer is to raise \u2014 put a 50-cent gas tax on the middle class and raise more taxes on the middle class and the working poor than on the wealthy. His own analysis says that unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 under his plan than it is today. And as far as what Mr. Bush says, he is the person who raised taxes on the middle class after saying he wouldn\u2019t. And just this year, Mr. Bush vetoed a tax increase on the wealthy that gave middle class tax relief. He vetoed middle class tax relief this year. And furthermore, under this administration, spending has increased more than it has in the last 20 years and he asked Congress to spend more money than it actually spent. Now, it\u2019s hard to out-spend Congress but he tried to for the last 3 years. So my view is the middle class is the \u2014 they\u2019ve been suffering, Jim. Now, should people pay more for Medicare if they can? Yes. Should they pay more for Social Security if they get more out of it than they paid in, they\u2019re upper income people? Yes. But look what\u2019s happened to the middle class. Middle class Americans are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago and they\u2019re paying higher taxes. The tax burden on them has not gone down. It has gone up. I don\u2019t think the answer is to slow the economy down more, drive unemployment up more and undermine the health of the private sector. The answer is to invest and grow this economy. That\u2019s what works in other countries and that\u2019s what\u2019ll work here."}

I think what I\u2019d like to talk about a minute, since you\u2019re asking the question, is the General Motors issue. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that the automobile executives made some errors in the 1980s, but I also think we should look at how much productivity has increased lately, how much labor has done to increase productivity and how much management has done. And we\u2019re still losing a lot of auto jobs, in my judgment, because we don\u2019t have a national economic strategy that will build the industrial base of this country. Just today I met with the presidents and the vice presidents of the Willow Run union here, near here. They both said they were Vietnam veterans supporting me because I had an economic program to put them back to work. We need an investment incentive to modernize plant and equipment; we\u2019ve got to control the health care costs for those people \u2014 otherwise we can\u2019t keep the manufacturing jobs here; and we need a tough trade policy that is fair, that insists on open markets in return for open markets. We ought to have a strategy that will build the economic and industrial base. So I think Mr. Perot was right in questioning the management practices. But they didn\u2019t have much of a partner in government here as compared with the policies the Germans and the Japanese followed, and I believe we can do better. That\u2019s one of the things I want to change. I know that we can grow manufacturing jobs. We did it in my state, and we can do it nationally."}

I once said, in a frivolous moment, when he got out of the race - If you can\u2019t stand the heat, buy an air conditioning company. And I take it back, because I think \u2014 he said he made a mistake. And the thing I find is if I make a mistake, I admit it. I\u2019ve never heard Governor Clinton make a mistake.

I think that should be a goal. I have never said we should write it into law if there is evidence that that goal cannot be achieved. The Natl Science Foundation did a study which said it would be difficult for us to reach fuel efficiency standards in excess of 37 miles per gallon by the year 2000. I think we should try to raise the fuel efficiency. And let me say this. I think we ought to have incentives to do it, I think we ought to push to do it. That doesn\u2019t mean we have to write it into the law. Look, I am a job creator, not a job destroyer. It is the Bush administration that has had no new jobs in the private sector in the last 4 years. In my state, we\u2019re leading the country in private sector job growth. But it is good for America to improve fuel efficiency. We also ought to convert more vehicles to compressed natural gas. That\u2019s another way to improve the environment."}

I am the one who\u2019s in the middle on this. Mr. Perot says it\u2019s a bad deal. Mr. Bush says it\u2019s a hunky-dory deal. I say on balance it does more good than harm if, if we can get some protection for the environment so that the Mexicans have to follow their own environmental standards, their own labor law standards, and if we have a genuine commitment to reeducate and retrain the American workers who lose their jobs and reinvest in this economy. I have a realistic approach to trade. I want more trade, and I know there are some good things in that agreement. But it can sure be made better. Let me just point out, just today in the Los Angeles Times Clyde Prestowitz, who was one of President Reagan\u2019s leading trade advisers and a life-long conservative Republican, endorsed my candidacy because he knows that I\u2019ll have a free and fair trade policy, a hard-headed, realistic policy, and not get caught up in rubber-stamping everything the Bush administration did.

We\u2019re going to have a hard time rebuilding it. But the real thing we got to have is a competitive economic strategy.

On the other hand, I don\u2019t think that we have any reason to believe that the dimensions of this crisis are anywhere near as great as the savings and loan crisis. The mistake that both parties made in Washington with the S&L business was deregulating them without proper capital requirements, proper oversight and regulation, proper training of the executives. Many people predicted what happened, and it was a disaster. The banking system in this country is fundamentally sound with some weak banks. I think that our goal ought to be first of all not to politicize it, not to frighten people; secondly to say that we have to enforce the law in 2 ways. We don\u2019t want to overreact, as the federal regulators have in my judgment, on good banks so that they\u2019ve created credit crunches, that is, they have made our recession worse in the last couple of years \u2014 but we do want to act prudently with the banks that are in trouble. We also want to say that insofar as is humanly possible the banking industry itself should pay for the cost of any bank failures; the taxpayers should not. And that will be my policy. And I believe if we have a good balanced approach, we can get the good banks loaning money again, end the credit crunch, have proper regulation on the ones that are in trouble, and not overreact.

Nobody touched that tar baby till the day after election in 1988 because they were flooding both parties with crooked PAC money, and it was in many cases stolen PAC money.

That is my commitment to you. It is the kind of change that can open up a whole new world of opportunities to America as we enter the last decade of this century and move towards the 21st century.

So we\u2019ve seen a deterioration in values, and one of the things that I think we should do about it in terms of cause is to instill values into the young people in our schools. We got away, we got into this feeling that value- free education was the thing. And I don\u2019t believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use. And, of course, as far as the how we make it better, yes, we can do better on interdiction.

And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down, because as a chief executive that\u2019s balanced ten budgets in a row, I\u2019ve had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices. First, I\u2019ve suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don\u2019t need and we can\u2019t afford. Mr. Bush has been critical of me for that, but I think those are the kinds of tough choices you have to make. I\u2019ve also suggested that there are weapons systems that we should proceed on, and I\u2019ve outlined those in detail. Secondly, we\u2019ve got to invest in economic growth in this country, in every part of this country. Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit. Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down. And, finally, we\u2019ve got to go out there and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren\u2019t being paid to this country. It\u2019s very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected. I\u2019ve also suggested that on the domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts. We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which is what we\u2019ve been doing under this administration. We can help people to live better lives, and at the same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare, and to become productive citizens again. The thing I don\u2019t understand about Mr. Bush\u2019s approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do. He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says he\u2019s against new taxes, although he\u2019s broken that pledge at least times in the last year that I know of; he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break. He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs. If he keeps this up, he\u2019s going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics. (Laughter) But I hope you won\u2019t take my five seconds away from me. I will say this \u2013"}

I think we have to demonstrate some flexibility and I think the FDA is attempting to do so now in trying to make it possible for new and experimental drugs to be available to people who are at risk at AIDS and I would hope that we could bring that kind of a policy to bear beginning in January.

And that, too, is a major difference between the vice president and me. Let me just give you one other example. We have a great many people, hundreds of thousands of people living on public assistance in this country. The 50 governors of this nation have proposed to the Congress that we help those families to get off of welfare, help those youngsters, help their mothers to become independent and self-sufficient.

Welfare reform is one way to do it. If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids don\u2019t lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of families, to get off of welfare, to become independent and self-sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives, the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children. That\u2019s just one example of how you can save money and improve the quality of life at the same time. In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very unwisely. One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance. Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he can\u2019t play little league ball that he can\u2019t go out on the ball field because he\u2019s afraid he\u2019s going to get hurt. And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I don\u2019t think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital. So these are the ways that you help families, you help youngsters to live better lives, and more decent lives. Were ready to go to work at the state and local level, all of us. I know the private sector is. People are all over the country. But it takes presidential leadership. It takes a commitment to being involved and the leading. And that\u2019s the kind of presidency I want to lead."}

I said from the beginning that we ought to continue research into the strategic system at about the level that was added in 1983, that\u2019s about a billion dollars a year. But I don\u2019t know of any reputable scientist who believed that this system, at least as originally conceived could possibly work, this notion of some kind of astrodome over ourselves that could protect us from enemy attack. It makes real sense. And as a matter of fact, the system that the administration is now talking about is very different from the one that was originally proposed in 1983. So, I\u2019m for continued research, but I also want strong conventional forces. Now, the other day, Mr. Bush said, \u00e2\u2030\u00a5Well, if we continue with Star War-Star Wars-we have to cut some place.\u00e2\u2030\u00a4 He hasn\u2019t told us where. We know where they\u2019re cutting. We know where you\u2019re cutting right now. You\u2019re cutting into the fiber and muscle of our conventional forces. You\u2019re cutting back on maintenance and equipment. An Air Force General not too long ago in Europe who said that pretty soon we\u2019d have airplanes without engines, tank commanders who can\u2019t drive their tanks more than three-quarters of a mile, because they don\u2019t have enough fuel. Coast Guard cutters tied up at the dock this summer, not patrolling. They\u2019re supposed to be our first line of defense against drugs and the war against drugs, because they don\u2019t have enough fuel. You have to make choices. We\u2019re not making those choices. And to spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr. Bush apparently wants to, although, he, himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately-on Star Wars-in my judgment makes no sense at all. We need a strong, credible, effective nuclear deterrent. We have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads right now on land, on sea and in the air, enough to blow up the Soviet Union forty times over. They have about 12,000. So, we\u2019ve got to move forward with those negotiations, get the level of strategic weapons down. But to continue to commit billions to this system makes no sense at all and I think Mr. Bush has been reconsidering his position over the course of the past few weeks. That\u2019s-at least that\u2019s what I read. Maybe he\u2019ll tell us where he stand on it tonight."}

I think it\u2019s going to require a combination of supply management and reasonable price supports to make sure that our farmers get a decent price and I think it also is going to require an administration that understand that there are tremendous opportunities out there for the development of new uses for agricultural products, new uses which can help us to clean up our environment at the same time. Bio-degradable plastics-plastic-gasohol, which the Vice President has been involved in, road de-icers made from corn products. I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future for rural communities and for rural America and at the same time working on Third World debt. As a matter of fact, Mexico, itself, is one of our biggest agricultural customers, so in the sense that we can work to help Mexico rebuild and expand and deal with these very serious economic problems we help our farmers at the same time."}

There is a commitment and there will always be a commitment to the safety of our working men and women. They deserve it and we\u2019re committed to them. Now, the broader question goes to the whole issue of deregulation and has deregulation worked or has deregulation not worked. In my judgment deregulation has worked. We have a deregulated economy and we have produced through low taxes, not high taxes, through deregulation \u2013 the spirit of entrepreneurship, the individual going out and starting a business, the businessman or women willing to go out and risk their investments to start up a business and hire people. We have produced 17 million jobs in this country since 1982. Deregulation as a form of political philosophy is a good philosophy. It\u2019s one that our opponents disagree with. They want a centralized government.

In the state of Massachusetts he has the homicide rate down to the lowest of any industrial state. It\u2019s substantially ahead of the national average. He\u2019s been able to do that with an educated program for the people of that state by adding some 1,500 new police officers; he\u2019s done it in turn by the leadership that I think he will bring to the ticket when he becomes president of the United States and fighting drugs. He\u2019s taken it down some four percent in the high schools of that state, while it\u2019s gone up about the rest of the nation.

There is no way of anticipating what may happen. I will say this: that we will set as our goal a steady, gradual reduction of the deficit, which will require tough choices on spending; it will require a good strong rate of economic growth; it will require a plan that the president works out with the Congress doesn\u2019t blame them, works it out with them, which brings that deficit down; it will require us to go out and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren\u2019t being paid in this country. And that\u2019s grossly unfair to the average American who is paying his taxes and paying them on time and doesn\u2019t have any alternative: it\u2019s taken out of his paycheck. Mr. Bush says we are going to put the IRS on every taxpayer. That\u2019s not what we are going to do. I\u2019m for the taxpayer bill of rights. But I think it\u2019s unconscionable, Ann, that we should be talking or thinking about imposing new taxes on average Americans when there are billions out there, over $100 billion, in taxes owed that aren\u2019t being paid. Now, I think if we work together on it, and if you have a president that will work with the Congress and the American people, we can bring that deficit down steadily, $20, $25, $30 billion a year, build economic growth, build a good strong future for America, invest in those things which we must invest in economic development, good jobs, good schools for our kids, college opportunity for young people, decent health care and affordable housing, and a clean and safe environment. We can do all of those things, and at the same time build a future in which we are standing on a good strong fiscal foundation. Senator Bentsen said, as you recall at the debate with Senator Quayle, that if you give any of us $200 billion worth of hot checks a year, we can create an illusion of prosperity. But sooner or later that credit card mentality isn\u2019t going to work. And I want to bring to the White House a sense of strength and fiscal responsibility which will build a good strong foundation under which this country, or above which country can move, grow, invest, and build the best America for its people and for our kids and our grandkids."}

I repeat, within days after you made that pledge, you broke it; you said, well, maybe as a last resort we\u2019ll do it. And you supported legislation this year that\u2019s involved tax increases not once, but twice. So that pledge isn\u2019t realistic, and I think the vice president knows it; I think the people of this country know it.

I can think of doctors and scientists, Jonas Salk who for example discovered a vaccine which cured one of the most dread diseases we ever had. And he\u2019s a hero. I think of classroom teachers, classroom teachers that I have had, classroom teachers that youngsters have today who are real heroes to our young people. Because they inspire them. They teach them. But more than that, they are role models. Members of the clergy who have done the same. Drug counselors out there in the street who are providing help to youngsters who come up to me and others who ask for help and want help, are doing the hard work, the heroic work, which it takes to provide that kind of leadership, that kind of counseling, that kind of support. I think of people in the law enforcement community who are taking their lives in their hands everyday, when they go up to one of those doors and kick it down and try to stop this flow of drugs into our communities and into our kids. So there are many, many heroes in this country today. These are people that give of themselves everyday and every week and every month. In many cases they are people in the community who are examples, and are role models. And I would hope that one of the things I could do as president is to recognize them, to give them the kind of recognition that they need and deserve so that more and more young people can themselves become the heroes of tomorrow, can go into public service, can go into teaching, can go into drug counseling, can go into law enforcement, and be heroes themselves to generations yet to come."}

And I said, what can we do about it. He said, no, she has leukemia, acute leukemia, a few weeks to live. We took the child to New York. Thanks to the miraculous sacrifice of doctors and nurses, the child stayed alive for six months and then died.

But I do think this, that the next president, even within a relatively stable budget and that\u2019s what we are going to have for the foreseeable future will have to make those tough choices that I was talking about and that Mr. Bush doesn\u2019t seem to want to make. And that really is going to be a challenge for the next president of the United States; I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question about it. But I also see a tremendous opportunity now to negotiate with the Soviet Union to build on the progress that we\u2019ve made with the INF Treaty, which I strongly supported and most Democrats did to get those reductions in strategic weapons, to get a test ban treaty, and to really make progress on the reduction of conventional forces in Europe. And if we can do that and do it in a way that gets deeper cuts on the Soviet side, which is where they ought to come from, then I think we have an opportunity over the long haul to begin to move some of our resources from the military to important domestic priorities that can provide college opportunity for that young woman whose mother wrote me from Texas just the other day, from Longview, Texas: two teachers, a mother and a father who have a child that\u2019s a freshman in college, an electrical engineering major, a very bright student and they can\u2019t afford to keep that child in college.

But the fact of it is, every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars. As a matter of fact, over 4 years, they\u2019ve missed the mark by nearly $600 billion. We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983. It was $200 billion deficit instead. And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether we\u2019ll deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery. Virtually every economic analysis that I\u2019ve heard of, including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a $263 billion deficit. In other words, it doesn\u2019t converge as the President suggests. It gets larger even with growth. What that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade. This is the worst trade year in American history by far. Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation. Real interest rates \u2014 the real cost of interest \u2014 will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that we\u2019re moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession.

And for the 5 years previous to our taking office, taxes doubled in the United States, and the budgets increased $318 billion. So, there is no ratio between taxing and balancing a budget. Whether you borrow the money or whether you simply tax it away from the people, you\u2019re taking the same amount of money out of the private sector, unless and until you bring down government\u2019s share of what it is taking.

There is no question that we face this massive deficit, and almost everybody agrees unless we get it down, the chances for long-term, healthy growth are nil. And it\u2019s also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children. The President says it will disappear overnight because of some reason. No one else believes that\u2019s the case. I do, and I\u2019m standing up to the issue with an answer that\u2019s fair. I think that\u2019s what leadership is all about. There\u2019s a difference between being a quarterback and a cheerleader, and when there\u2019s a real problem, a President must confront it. What I was referring to, of course, in the comment that you referred to was the situation in Lebanon. Now, for three occasions, one after another, our Embassies were assaulted in the same way by a truck with demolitions. The first time \u2014 and I did not criticize the President, because these things can happen \u2014 once, and sometimes twice \u2014 the second time the barracks in Lebanon were assaulted, as we all remember. There was two or three commission reports, recommendations by the CIA, the State Department, and the others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves. Now, I believe that a President must command that White House and those who work for him. It\u2019s the toughest job on Earth, and you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done. I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is what\u2019s needed, because all my life that has been the way in which I have sought to lead. And that\u2019s why in this campaign I\u2019m telling you exactly what I want to do. I am answering your questions. I am trying to provide leadership now, before the election, so that the American people can participate in that decision."}

They don\u2019t want this arms race. And they don\u2019t want this deadly new effort to bring weapons into the heavens. And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world. The American people see this debt, and they know it\u2019s got to come down. And if it won\u2019t come down, the economy\u2019s going to slow down, maybe go into a recession. They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history. And they know this debt must come down as well, because it\u2019s unfair to our children. The American people want this environment protected. They know that these toxic waste dumps should have been cleaned up a long time ago, and they know that people\u2019s lives and health are being risked, because we\u2019ve had an administration that has been totally insensitive to the law and the demand for the protection of the environment. The American people want their children educated. They want to get our edge back in science, and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap that\u2019s widening between the United States and Europe and Japan. The American people want to keep opening doors. They want those civil rights laws enforced. They want the equal rights amendment ratified. They want equal pay for comparable effort for women. And they want it because they\u2019ve understood from the beginning that when we open doors, we\u2019re all stronger, just as we were at the Olympics. I think as you make the case, the American people will increasingly come to our cause."}

I think sometimes Mr. Mondale\u2019s running away from his. But I\u2019m running on the record of what we have asked for. We\u2019ll continue to try to get things that we didn\u2019t get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 6.1 percent, a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and State governments that has been unjustly seized by the Federal Government. And you might find those words in a Democratic platform of some years ago \u2014 I know, because I was a Democrat at that time. And I left the party eventually, because I could no longer follow the turn in the Democratic leadership that took us down an entirely different path, a path of centralizing authority in the Federal Government, lacking trust in the American people. I promised, when we took office, that we would reduce inflation. We have, to one-third of what it was. I promised that we would reduce taxes. We did, 25 percent across the board. That barely held even with \u2014 if it did that much \u2014 with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977. But at least it took that burden away from them. I said that we would create jobs for our people, and we did \u2014 6 million in the last 20 or 21 months. I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons. We have done that. All of the things that I said we would do, from inflation being down, interest rates being down, unemployment falling, all of those things we have done. And I think this is something the American people see. I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education \u2014 on excellence in education. And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems. We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth. All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years. So, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw - The leadership isn\u2019t taking us where we want to go."}

There are some other things that have been said here \u2014 back, and you said that I might be able to dredge them up. Mr. Mondale referred to the farmers\u2019 worst year. The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done. The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 21\\1\/2\\-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier. All of these things are presently being rectified, and I think that we are going to salvage the farmers. As a matter of fact, there has been less than one-quarter of 1 percent of foreclosures of the 270,000 loans from government that the farmers have."}

I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people. The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest. Is it really the view of the American people, however you feel on the question of abortion, that government ought to be reaching into your livingrooms and making choices like this? I think it cannot work, won\u2019t work, and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law. Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them. The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do. I think these questions are inherently personal and moral, and every individual instance is different. Every American should be aware of the seriousness of the step. But there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do. Now, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion. Somebody went to a woman and nearly killed her. That\u2019s always been a serious crime and always should be a serious crime. But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped? Do we really want those decisions made by judges who\u2019ve been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty? I don\u2019t think so, and I think it\u2019s going in exactly the wrong direction. In America, on basic moral questions we have always let the people decide in their own personal lives. We haven\u2019t felt so insecure that we\u2019ve reached for the club of state to have our point of view. It\u2019s been a good instinct. And we\u2019re the most religious people on Earth. One final point - President Reagan, as Governor of California, signed a bill which is perhaps the most liberal proabortion bill of any State in the Union."}

Since I\u2019ve got about 20 seconds, let me just say one thing. The question of agriculture came up a minute ago. Net farm income is off 50 percent in the last 3 years, and every farmer knows it. And the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo, which has caused farm exports to drop 20 percent. It\u2019s been a big failure.

Under the 1981 tax bill, people making $200,000 a year got $60,000 in tax relief over 3 years, while people making $30,000 a year, all taxes considered, got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up. That\u2019s why my proposal protects everybody from $25,000 a year or less against any tax increases, and treats those $70,000 and under in a way that is more beneficial than the way the President proposes with a sales tax or a flat tax. What does this mean in real life? Well, the other day, Vice President Bush disclosed his tax returns to the American people. He\u2019s one of the wealthiest Americans, and he\u2019s our Vice President. In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes. In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12.8 percent in taxes. That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work. I believe we need some fairness. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people who\u2019ve already got no relief or actually got a tax increase."}

Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here. It has begun to decline, but it is still going up. On the other hand, women heads of household \u2014 single women heads of household have \u2014 for the first time there\u2019s been a turndown in the rate of poverty for them. We have found also in our studies that in this increase in poverty, it all had to do with their private earnings. It had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs. We are spending now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980. We\u2019re spending a third more on all of the \u2014 well, all of the programs of human service. We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before \u2014 2,300,000 more are receiving them \u2014 even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them. We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits. We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy. Some time ago, Mr. Mondale said something about education and college students and help of that kind. Half \u2014 one out of two of the full-time college students in the United States are receiving some form of Federal aid. But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans. We didn\u2019t think that was right. And so, we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college, their family incomes were so low. So, there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been, taking care of more people than they ever have. 7.7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest 20 percent of earnings \u2014 7.7 million have moved up into another bracket since our administration took over, leaving only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there had been more than 13 million."}

I don\u2019t mind those enterprise zones; let\u2019s try them, but not as a substitute for the others. Certainly education and training is crucial. If these young Americans don\u2019t have the skills that make them attractive to employees, they\u2019re not going to get jobs. The next thing is to try to get more entrepreneurship in business within the reach of minorities so that these businesses are located in the communities in which they\u2019re found. The other thing is, we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth. There is no question that the poor are worse off. I think the President genuinely believes that they\u2019re better off. But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago. How you can cut school lunches, how you can cut student assistance, how you can cut housing, how you can cut disability benefits, how you can do all of these things and then the people receiving them \u2014 for example, the disabled, who have no alternative \u2014 how they\u2019re going to do better, I don\u2019t know. Now, we need a tight budget, but there\u2019s no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and they\u2019re hurting. One final point if I might. There\u2019s another part of the lopsided economy that we\u2019re in today, and that is that these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports.

I want to thank President Reagan for agreeing to debate. He didn\u2019t have to, and he did, and we all appreciate it. The President\u2019s favorite question is: Are you better off? Well, if you\u2019re wealthy, you\u2019re better off. If you\u2019re middle income, you\u2019re about where you were. And if you\u2019re modest income, you\u2019re worse off. That\u2019s what the economists tell us. But is that really the question that should be asked? Isn\u2019t the real question is will we be better off? Will our children be better off? Are we building the future that this nation needs? I believe that if we ask those questions that bear on our future, not just congratulate ourselves but challenge us to solve those problems, you\u2019ll see that we need new leadership. Are we better of with this arms race? Will we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens? Are we better off when we deemphasize our values in human rights? Are we better off when we load our children with this fantastic debt? Would fathers and mothers feel proud of themselves if they loaded their children with debts like this nation is now \u2014 over a trillion dollars on the shoulders of our children? Can we say, really say that we will be better off when we pull away from sort of that basic American instinct of decency and fairness? I would rather lose a campaign about decency than win a campaign about self-interest. I don\u2019t think this nation is composed of people who care only for themselves. And when we sought to assault Social Security and Medicare, as the record shows we did, I think that was mean-spirited. When we terminated 400,000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability \u2014 confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for 4 years, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what America is all about. America is a fair society, and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him. I believe there\u2019s fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system. I believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment. And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful. These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price. That\u2019s not fair for our future. I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training, because this world is more complex and we\u2019re being pressed harder all the time. I believe in opening doors. We won the Olympics, in part, because we\u2019ve had civil rights laws and the laws that prohibit discrimination against women. I have been for those efforts all my life. The President\u2019s record is quite different. The question is our future. President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, \u201cWe are great, but we can be greater.\u201d We can be better if we face our future, rejoice in our strengths, face our problems, and by solving them, build a better society for our children. Thank you."}

There\u2019s not only what is on your paper resume that makes you qualified to run for or to hold office. It\u2019s how you approach problems and what your values are. I think if one is taking a look at my career they\u2019ll see that I level with the people; that I approach problems analytically; that I am able to assess the various facts with reference to a problem, and I can make the hard decisions. I\u2019m intrigued when I hear Vice-President Bush talk about his support of the president\u2019s economic program and how everything is just going so beautifully. I, too, recall when Vice President Bush was running in the primary against President Reagan and he called the program voodoo economics, and it was and it is. We are facing absolutely massive deficits; this administration has chosen to ignore it; the president has failed to put forth a plan to deal with those deficits and if everything believes that everything is corning up roses, perhaps the vice-president should join me as I travel around the country and speak to people. People in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, are not terribly thrilled with what\u2019s happening in the economy because they\u2019re standing in the light of a closed plant because they\u2019ve lost their jobs. The people in Youngstown, Ohio, have stores that are boarded up because the economy is not doing well. It\u2019s not only the old industries that are failing, it\u2019s also the new ones. In San Jose, California, they\u2019re complaining because they can\u2019t export their high-tech qualities \u2013 goods \u2013 to Japan and other countries. The people in the Northwest \u2013 in the state of Washington and Oregon \u2013 are complaining about what\u2019s happening to the timber industry and to the agriculture industry. So, so things are not as great as the administration is wanting us to believe in their television commercials. My feeling, quite frankly, is that I have enough experience to see the problems, address them and make the tough decisions and level with people with reference to those problems."}

We favor enterprise zones to give \u2013 and it\u2019s been blocked by Tip O\u2019Neill and that House of Representatives, those liberals in that House blocked a new idea to bring jobs into the black communities across the country. And because it\u2019s not an old handout, special federal spending program, it\u2019s blocked there \u2013 a good idea. And I\u2019d like to sec that tried. We\u2019ve brought more civil rights cases in the Justice Department than the previous administration by far. We believe in trying something new to help these black teenage kids; the minimum wage differential that says, \u201cLook,\u201d to an employer, \u201chire these guys. And, yes, they\u2019re willing to work for slightly less than the minimum wage. Give \u2019em a training job in the private sector.\u201d We threw out that old CETA that didn\u2019t train people for jobs that existed, simply rammed them onto the government payroll, and we put in a thing called the Job Training Partnership Act. Wonderful new legislation that\u2019s helping blacks more and more. We think of civil rights as something like crime in your neighborhoods. And, for example, when crime figures are going in the right direction that\u2019s good, that\u2019s a civil right. Similarly, we think of it in terms of quality of life, and that means interest rates. You know, it\u2019s funny, Mr. Mondale talks about real interest rates. The real interest rate is what you pay when you go down and try to buy a TV set or buy a car, or do whatever it is. The interest rates when we left office were 21% percent. Inflation! Is it a civil right to have the going right off the chart so you\u2019re busting every American family, those who can afford it the least? No, we\u2019ve got a good record. We\u2019ve got it on civil rights legislation, minority set-asides, more help for black colleges, and we\u2019ve got it in terms of an economy that\u2019s offering people opportunity and hope instead of despair."}

And I think everybody knows that. We had ambassadors killed in Sudan and the Lebanon some time ago, a long time ago. When you see the Israeli building in Lebanon after the death of our marines you see that, hit by terrorism, the Israelis, with all their experience fighting terrorism, you know it\u2019s difficult. When you see Khomeini wraith his radical Islam resorting to government-sponsored terrorism, it\u2019s very difficult. The intelligence business can do a good job, and I\u2019m always one that defends the Central Intelligence Agency. I believe we ought to strengthen it and I believe we still have the best foreign intelligence business in the world. But it is very difficult to get the source information that you need to go after something as shadowy as international terror. There was a difference between Iran and what happened in Lebanon. In Iran you had a government holding a U.S. embassy; the government sanctioning the takeover of that embassy by those students; the government negotiating with the United States government for their release. In Lebanon, in the terror that happened at the embassy, you have the government there, Mr. Gemayel, that wants to help fight against terrorism. But because of the melee in the Middle East, it\u2019s there today and has been there yesterday and the day before, and everyone that\u2019s had experience in that area knows, it is a very different thing. So what we\u2019ve got to do is use absolutely the best security possible. I don\u2019t think you can go assigning blame. The president, of course, is the best I\u2019ve ever seen at accepting that. He\u2019s been wonderful about it in absolutely everything that happens. But I think fair-minded people that really understand international terror know that it\u2019s very hard to guard against. And the answer then really lies in the Middle East and terrorism happening all over the world, is a solution to the Palestine question, the follow on to Camp David under the umbrella of the Reagan September of 1982 initiative. That will reduce terror, it won\u2019t eliminate it."}

It was at that time that President Reagan gave a speech welcoming them home \u2013 as America did, we were so excited to see them back. But what he said was: The United States has been embarrassed for the last time. We\u2019re going to stand tall and if this ever happens again, there\u2019s going to be swift and immediate steps taken to address the wrong that our country has founded \u2013 has suffered. In April of J983 I was in Beirut and visited the ambassador at the embassy. Two weeks later, that embassy was bombed. At that time \u2013 take a look at the crazy activities of terrorists, you can\u2019t blame that on anybody. They\u2019re going to do crazy things and you just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. The following October, there was another bombing and that bombing took place at the marine barracks, where there were 242 young men who were killed. Right after that bombing occurred, there was a commission set up called the Long Commission. That commission did a study of the security arrangements around where the marines were sleeping and found that there was negligence, that they did not have proper gates up, proper precautions to stop those trucks from coming in. And so the Long Commission issued a report, and President Reagan got up and he said: I\u2019m commander in chief. I take responsibility. And we all waited for something to be done when he look responsibility. Well, last month we had our third bombing, The first time, the first embassy, there was no gate up, The second time, with our Marines, the gate was open. The third time, the gate was there but it had not been installed. And what was the president\u2019s reaction? Well, the security arrangements were not in, our people were placed in that embassy in an unsecured time, and the marines who were guarding it were left to go away and there were other people guarding the embassy. Again the president said: I assume responsibility. I\u2019d like to know what that means. Are we going to take proper precautions before we put Americans in situations where they\u2019re in danger, or are we just going to walk away, throwing our arms in the air now \u2013 quite a reversal from the first time, from the first time when he said he was going to do something?

They\u2019re moving in militarily instead of promoting the Contadora process, which, as you know, is the process that is in place with the support of Mexico and Colombia and Panama and Venezuela. Instead of supporting the process, our administration has in Nicaragua been supporting covert activities to keep that revolution going in order to overthrow the Sandinista government; in El Salvador was not pushing the head of the government to move toward correction of the civil rights; human rights problems that existed there, and now this administration seems almost befuddled by the fact that Nicaragua is moving to participate in the Contadora process, and El Salvador is, through its President Duarte, is reaching out to the guerrillas in order to negotiate a peace.

Congress did not support it and as a matter of fact, just this week, the Congress voted in cut off covert aid to Nicaragua unless and until a request is made and there is evidence of need for it, and the Congress approves it again in March.

In two months they sat down and they negotiated a treaty. We do not now have to worry about that type of testing. It can be done; it will be done, if only you have the will to do it. Again, remember it is mutual; it is verifiable and it is a challenge that once that challenge is not met, if testing were to resume, then we would continue testing as well."}

Ronald Reagan and I have put our trust in the American people. We\u2019ve moved some of the power away from Washington, D.C., and put it back with the people. We\u2019re pulling together. The neighborhoods are safer \u2019cause crime is going down. Your sons and daughters are doing better in school. Test scores are going up. There\u2019s a new opportunity lying out there in the future. Science, technology and space offering opportunity that, to everybody, all the young ones coming up. And abroad there\u2019s new leadership and respect. And Ronald Reagan is clearly the strong leader of the free world. And I\u2019ll be honest with you. It\u2019s a joy to serve with a president who does not apologize for the United States of America. Mr. Mondale, on the other hand, has one idea. Go out and tax the American people. And then he wants to repeal indexing, to wipe out the one protection that those at the lowest end of the economic scale have protecting them against being rammed into higher and higher tax brackets. We just owe our country too much to go back to that kind of an approach. I\u2019d like to say something to the young people. I started a business. I know what it is to have a dream and have a job and work hard to employ others and really to participate in the American dream. Some of you out there are finishing high school or college and some of you are starting out in the working place. And we want for you America\u2019s greatest gift. And that is opportunity. And then, peace. Yes, I did serve in combat. I was shot down when I was a young kid, scared to death. And all that did, saw friends die, but that heightened my convictions about peace. It is absolutely essential that we guarantee the young people that they will not know the agony of war. America\u2019s gift, opportunity and peace. Now we do have some unfinished business. We must continue to go ahead. The world is too complex to go back to vacillation and weakness. We\u2019ve too much going on to go back to the failed policies of the past. The future is too bright not to give it our best shot. Together we can go forward and lift America up to meet her greatest dreams. Thank you very much."}

I was very interested to hear about Central America and our process down there, and I thought for a moment that instead of a debate I was going to find Mr. Mondale in complete agreement with what we\u2019re doing, because the plan that he has outlined is the one we\u2019ve been following for quite some time, including diplomatic processes throughout Central America and working closely with the Contadora group.

Mr. President, I\u2019d like to head for the fence and try to catch that one before it goes over, but I\u2019ll go on to another question. You and Mr. Mondale have already disagreed about what you had to say about recalling submarine-launched missiles. There\u2019s another, a similar issue out there that relates to your \u2014 it is said, at least, that you were unaware that the Soviet retaliatory power was based on land-based missiles. First, is that correct? Secondly, if it is correct, have you informed yourself in the meantime? And third, is it even necessary for the President to be so intimately involved in strategic details? Yes, this had to do with our disarmament talks. And the whole controversy about land missiles came up because we thought that the strategic nuclear weapons, the most destabilizing are the land-based. You put your thumb on a button and somebody blows up 20 minutes later. So, we thought that it would be simpler to negotiate first with those. And then we made it plain, a second phase, take up the submarine-launched or the airborne missiles. The Soviet Union, to our surprise \u2014 and not just mine \u2014 made it plain when we brought this up that they placed, they thought, a greater reliance on the land-based missiles and, therefore, they wanted to take up all three. And we agreed. We said, \u201cAll right, if that\u2019s what you want to do.\u201d But it was a surprise to us, because they outnumbered us 64 to 36 in submarines and 20 percent more bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles than we had. So, why should we believe that they had placed that much more reliance on land-based? But even after we gave in and said, \u201cAll right, let\u2019s discuss it all,\u201d they walked away from the table. We didn\u2019t. The President\u2019s Age Mr. Trewhitt.

What\u2019s at issue here is the President\u2019s application of his authority to understand what a President must know to lead this nation, secure our defense, and make the decisions and the judgments that are necessary. A minute ago the President quoted Cicero, I believe. I want to quote somebody a little closer to home, Harry Truman. He said, \u201cThe buck stops here.\u201d We just heard the President\u2019s answer for the problems at the barracks in Lebanon, where 241 marines were killed. What happened? First, the Joint Chiefs of Staff went to the President, said, \u201cDon\u2019t put those troops there.\u201d They did it. And then 5 days before the troops were killed, they went back to the President, through the Secretary of Defense, and said, \u201cPlease, Mr. President, take those troops out of there because we can\u2019t defend them.\u201d They didn\u2019t do it. And we know what happened. After that, once again, our Embassy was exploded. This is the fourth time this has happened \u2014 an identical attack, in the same region, despite warnings \u2014 even public warnings \u2014 from the terrorists. Who\u2019s in charge? Who\u2019s handling this matter? That\u2019s my main point. Now, on arms control, we\u2019re completing 4 years. This is the first administration since the bomb went off that made no progress. We have an arms race underway instead. A President has to lead his government or it won\u2019t be done. Different people with different views fight with each other. For 3\\1\/2\\ years, this administration avoided arms control, resisted tabling arms control proposals that had any hope of agreeing, rebuked their negotiator in 1981 when he came close to an agreement, at least in principle, on medium-range weapons. And we have this arms race underway. And a recent book that just came out by perhaps the Nation\u2019s most respected author in this field, Strobe Talbott, called \u201cDeadly Gambits,\u201d concludes that this President has failed to master the essential details needed to command and lead us, both in terms of security and terms of arms control. That\u2019s why they call the President the Commander in Chief. Good intentions, I grant. But it takes more than that. You must be tough and smart. The President\u2019s Leadership Mr. Trewhitt. This question of leadership keeps arising in different forms in this discussion already. And the President, Mr. Mondale, has called you whining and vacillating, among the more charitable phrases \u2014 weak, I believe. It is a question of leadership. And he has made the point that you have not repudiated some of the semidiplomatic activity of the Reverend Jackson, particularly in Central America. Did you approve of his diplomatic activity? And are you prepared to repudiate him now? I read his statement the other day. I don\u2019t admire Fidel Castro at all. And I\u2019ve said that. Che Guevara was a contemptible figure in civilization\u2019s history. I know the Cuban state as a police state, and all my life I\u2019ve worked in a way that demonstrates that. But Jesse Jackson is an independent person. I don\u2019t control him. And let\u2019s talk about people we do control. In the last debate,\\1\\ (FOOTNOTE) the Vice President of the United States said that I said the marines had died shamefully and died in shame in Lebanon. I demanded an apology from Vice President Bush because I had, instead, honored these young men, grieved for their families, and think they were wonderful Americans that honored us all. What does the President have to say about taking responsibility for a Vice President who won\u2019t apologize for something like that?

I\u2019m convinced that the result of this would be that people who are Hispanic, people who have different languages or speak with an accent, would find it difficult to be employed. I think that\u2019s wrong. We\u2019ve never had citizenship tests in our country before, and I don\u2019t think we should have a citizenship card today. That is counterproductive. I do support the other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill that strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen other ways of dealing with undocumented workers in this difficult area and dealing with the problem of settling people who have lived here for many, many years and do not have an established status. I have further strongly recommended that this administration do something it has not done, and that is to strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen the officials in this government that deal with undocumented workers, and to do so in a way that\u2019s responsible and within the Constitution of the United States. We need an answer to this problem, but it must be an American answer that is consistent with justice and due process. Everyone in this room, practically, here tonight, is an immigrant. We came here loving this nation, serving it, and it has served all of our most bountiful dreams. And one of those dreams is justice. And we need a measure \u2014 and I will support a measure \u2014 that brings about those objectives but avoids that one aspect that I think is very serious.

But no one knows whether Armageddon, those prophecies mean that Armageddon is a thousand years away or day after tomorrow. So, I have never seriously warned and said we must plan according to Armageddon. Now, with regard to having to say whether we would try to survive in the event of a nuclear war, of course we would. But let me also point out that to several parliaments around the world, in Europe and in Asia, I have made a statement to each one of them, and I\u2019ll repeat it here: A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. And that is why we are maintaining a deterrent and trying to achieve a deterrent capacity to where no one would believe that they could start such a war and escape with limited damage. But the deterrent \u2014 and that\u2019s what it is for \u2014 is also what led me to propose what is now being called the Star Wars concept, but propose that we research to see if there isn\u2019t a defensive weapon that could defend against incoming missiles. And if such a defense could be found, wouldn\u2019t it be far more humanitarian to say that now we can defend against a nuclear war by destroying missiles instead of slaughtering millions of people?

We have had for many years, understandably, a system of restraints on high technology because the Soviets are behind us. And any research or development along the Star Wars schemes would inevitably involve our most advanced computers, our most advanced engineering. And the thought that we would share this with the Soviet Union is, in my opinion, a total non-STARTer. I would not let the Soviet Union get their hands on it at all. Now, what\u2019s wrong with Star Wars? There\u2019s nothing wrong with the theory of it. If we could develop a principle that would say both sides could fire all their missiles and no one would get hurt, I suppose it\u2019s a good idea. But the fact of it is we\u2019re so far away from research that even comes close to that, that the Director of Engineering Research at the Defense Department said to get there we would have to solve eight problems, each of which are more difficult than the atomic bomb and the Manhattan project. It would cost something like a trillion dollars to test and deploy weapons. The second thing is this all assumes that the Soviets wouldn\u2019t respond in kind. And they always do. We don\u2019t get behind. They won\u2019t get behind. And that\u2019s been the tragic story of the arms race. We have more at stake in space satellites than they do. If we could stop, right now, the testing and the deployment of these space weapons \u2014 and the President\u2019s proposals go clear beyond research; if it was just research we wouldn\u2019t have any argument, because maybe someday, somebody will think of something \u2014 but to commit this nation to a buildup of antisatellite and space weapons at this time, in their crude state, would bring about an arms race that\u2019s very dangerous indeed. One final point. The most dangerous aspect of this proposal is, for the first time, we would delegate to computers the decision as to whether to start a war. That\u2019s dead wrong. There wouldn\u2019t be time for a President to decide; it would be decided by these remote computers. It might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer might decide it\u2019s a missile \u2014 and off we go.

This evening we talked about national strength. I believe we need to be strong, and I will keep us strong. But I think strength must also require wisdom and smarts in its exercise. That\u2019s key to the strength of our nation. A President must know the essential facts essential to command. But a President must also have a vision of where this nation should go. Tonight, as Americans, you have a choice. And you\u2019re entitled to know where we would take this country if you decide to elect us. As President, I would press for long-term, vigorous economic growth. That\u2019s why I want to get these debts down and these interest rates down, restore America\u2019s exports, help rural America, which is suffering so much, and bring the jobs back here for our children. I want this next generation to be the best educated in American history, to invest in the human mind and science again, so we\u2019re out front. I want this nation to protect its air, its water, its land, and its public health. America is not temporary; we\u2019re forever. And as Americans, our generation should protect this wonderful land for our children. I want a nation of fairness, where no one is denied the fullness of life or discriminated against, and we deal compassionately with those in our midst who are in trouble. And, above all, I want a nation that\u2019s strong. Since we debated 2 weeks ago, the United States and the Soviet Union have built a hundred more warheads, enough to kill millions of Americans and millions of Soviet citizens. This doesn\u2019t strengthen us. This weakens the chances of civilization to survive. I remember the night before I became Vice President. I was given the briefing and told that any time, night or day, I might be called upon to make the most fateful decision on Earth \u2014 whether to fire these atomic weapons that could destroy the human species. That lesson tells us two things: One, pick a President that you know will know if that tragic moment ever comes what he must know, because there\u2019ll be no time for staffing committees or advisers. A President must know right then. But above all, pick a President who will fight to avoid the day when that God-awful decision ever needs to be made. And that\u2019s why this election is so terribly important. America and Americans decide not just what\u2019s happening in this country. We are the strongest and most powerful free society on Earth. When you make that judgment, you are deciding not only the future of our nation; in a very profound respect, you\u2019re deciding the future of the world. We need to move on. It\u2019s time for America to find new leadership. Please, join me in this cause to move confidently and with a sense of assurance and command to build the blessed future of our nation."}

I think the American people tonight have much to be grateful for \u2014 an economic recovery that has become expansion, freedom and, most of all, we are at peace. I am grateful for the chance to reaffirm my commitment to reduce nuclear weapons and, one day, to eliminate them entirely. The question before you comes down to this - Do you want to see America return to the policies of weakness of the last 4 years? Or do we want to go forward, marching together, as a nation of strength and that\u2019s going to continue to be strong? We shouldn\u2019t be dwelling on the past, or even the present. The meaning of this election is the future and whether we\u2019re going to grow and provide the jobs and the opportunities for all Americans and that they need. Several years ago, I was given an assignment to write a letter. It was to go into a time capsule and would be read in 100 years when that time capsule was opened. I remember driving down the California coast one day. My mind was full of what I was going to put in that letter about the problems and the issues that confront us in our time and what we did about them. But I couldn\u2019t completely neglect the beauty around me \u2014 the Pacific out there on one side of the highway, shining in the sunlight, the mountains of the coast range rising on the other side. And I found myself wondering what it would be like for someone \u2014 wondering if someone 100 years from now would be driving down that highway, and if they would see the same thing. And with that thought, I realized what a job I had with that letter. I would be writing a letter to people who know everything there is to know about us. We know nothing about them. They would know all about our problems. They would know how we solved them, and whether our solution was beneficial to them down through the years or whether it hurt them. They would also know that we lived in a world with terrible weapons, nuclear weapons of terrible destructive power, aimed at each other, capable of crossing the ocean in a matter of minutes and destroying civilization as we knew it. And then I thought to myself, what are they going to say about us, what are those people 100 years from now going to think? They will know whether we used those weapons or not. Well, what they will say about us 100 years from now depends on how we keep our rendezvous with destiny. Will we do the things that we know must be done and know that one day, down in history 100 years or perhaps before, someone will say, \u201cThank God for those people back in the 1980\u2019s for preserving our freedom, for saving for us this blessed planet called Earth, with all its grandeur and its beauty.\u201d You know, I am grateful to all of you for giving me the opportunity to serve you for these 4 years, and I seek reelection because I want more than anything else to try to complete the new beginning that we charted 4 years ago. George Bush, who I think is one of the finest Vice Presidents this country has ever had \u2014 George Bush and I have crisscrossed the country, and we\u2019ve had, in these last few months, a wonderful experience.

I believe that inflation today is caused by government simply spending more than government takes in, at the same time that government has imposed upon business and industry, from the shopkeeper on the corner to the biggest industrial plant in America, countless harassing regulations and punitive taxes that have reduced productivity at the same time they have increased the cost of production. And when you are reducing productivity at the same time that you are turning out printing-press money in excessive amounts, you\u2019re causing inflation. And it isn\u2019t really higher prices, it\u2019s just, you are reducing the value of the money. You are robbing the American people of their savings. And so, the plan that I have proposed \u2013 and contrary to what John says, my plan is for a phased-in tax cut over a three-year period, tax increase and depreciation allowances for business and industry to give them the capital to refurbish plant and equipment, research and development, improved technology \u2013 all of which we see our foreign competitors having, and we have the greatest percentage of outmoded industrial plant and equipment of any of the industrial nations \u2013 produce more, have stable money supply, and give the people of this country a greater share of their own savings. Now, I know that this has been called inflationary by my opponent and by the man who isn\u2019t here tonight. But I don\u2019t see where it is inflationary to have people keep more of their earnings and spend it, and it isn\u2019t inflationary for government to take that money away from them and spend it on the things it wants to spend it on. I believe we need incentive for the individual, and for business and industry, and I believe the plan that I have submitted, with detailed backing, and which has been approved by a number of our leading economists in the country, is based on projections. conservative projections out for the next five years, that indicates that this plan would, by 1983, result in a balanced budget. We have to remember, when we talk a tax cut, we\u2019re only talking about reducing a tax increase, because this Administration has left us with a built-in tax increase that will amount to $86 billion next year."}

And since I first made that proposal 15 months ago, the price of gasoline, which was then $.80, has gone up to about $1.30. In other words, we\u2019ve had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country \u2013 or much of it \u2013 into the pockets of OPEC oil producers.

To say that we are limited, and at a dangerous point in this country with regard to energy, I think, is to ignore the fact. The fact is, that in today\u2019s oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used. But it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground. And this is known oil reserves, known supplies. There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago. We have a coal supply that is equal to 50% of the world\u2019s coal supply, good for centuries, in this country. I grant you that prices may go up, because as you go further and have to go deeper, you are adding to the cost of production. We have nuclear power, which, I believe, with the safest. the most stringent of safety requirements, could meet our energy needs for the next couple of decades while we go forward exploring the areas of solar power and other forms of energy that might be renewable and that would not be exhaustible. All of these things can be done. When you stop and think that we are only drilling on 2%. have leased only 2% of the possible. possibility for oil of the continental shelf around the United States; when you stop to think that the government has taken over 100 million acres of land out of circulation in Alaska, alone, that is believed by geologists to contain much in the line of minerals and energy sources, then I think it is the Government, and the Government with its own restrictions and regulations, that is creating the energy crisis.

I agree with what I think is the major premise of your question, sir, that we are going to have to create a new conservation ethic in the minds of the American people. and that\u2019s simply why I proposed, 15 months ago, the emergency excise tax on gasoline that I did. I did it as a security measure to be sure, because I would rather see us reduce the consumption of imported oil than have to send American boys to fight in the Persian Gulf. But at the same time, I think it\u2019s going to take a dramatic measure of that kind to convince the American people that we will have to reduce the use of the private automobile. We simply cannot have people sitting one behind the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams going in and out of our great cities. We are going to have to resort to van pooling, to car pooling. We\u2019re going to have to develop better community transportation systems, so that with buses and light rail, we can replace the private automobile in those places where it clearly is not energy-efficient. I think that, with respect to housing, when we are consuming, even though our per capita income today is about the same as that of the Federal Republic of Germany, we are consuming about, by a factor of two, the amount of energy that they consume in that country. Surely, there are things that we can do in the retrofitting, ;n the redesign of our homes, not only of our houses, but of our commercial structures, as well, that will make it possible for us to achieve. According to one study that was published a short time ago \u2013 the Harvard Business School study \u2013 indicated that just in the commercial sector alone of the economy, we could save between 30% and 40% of the energy that we consume in this country today. So I think, yes, we will have to change in a very appreciable way, some of the lifestyles that we now enjoy."}

That is the same Government that, in 1920, told us we only had enough oil left for 13 years, and 19 years later, told us we only had enough left for another 15 years. As for saving energy and conserving, the American people haven\u2019t been doing badly at that. Because in industry today, we\u2019re producing more, over the last several years, and at 12% less use of energy than we were back in about 1973. And motorists are using 8% less than they were back at that time of the oil embargo. So, I think we are proving that we can go forward with conservation and benefit from that. But also, I think it is safe to say that we do have sources of energy that have not yet been used or found."}

The rest of the Western world, we are told, may see its consumption increase from 51 million barrels to about 66 million. And that additional 15 million barrels is going to cause scarcity. It is going to cause scarcity in world markets because there are at least five reputable studies, one even by the American Petroleum Institute itself, that, I think, clearly indicate that somewhere along around the end of the present decade, total world demand for oil is simply going to exceed total available supplies.

I think one of the problems today with the cities is Federal aid. The mayors that I\u2019ve talked to in some of our leading cities tell! me that the Federal grants that come with. for a specific cause or a specific objective, come with such red tape, such priorities established by a bureaucracy in Washington, that the local government\u2019s hands are tied with regard to using that money as they feel could best be used, and for what they think might be the top priority. If they had that money without those government restrictions, every one of them has told me they could make great savings and make far greater use of the money. What I have been advocating is, why don\u2019t we start with the Federal Government turning back tax sources to states and local governments, as well as the responsibilities for those programs? Seventy-five percent of the people live in the cities. I don\u2019t know of a city in America that doesn\u2019t have the kind of problems you\u2019re talking about. But, where are we getting the money that the Federal Government is putting out to help them? New York is being taxed for money that will then go to Detroit. But Detroit is being taxed for money that, let\u2019s say, will go to Chicago, while Chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in Philadelphia. Wouldn\u2019t it make a lot more sense if the government let them keep their own money there in the first place? But there are other things that we can do with the inner cities, and I\u2019ve believed. I have talked of having zones in those cities that are run down, where there is a high percentage of people on welfare, and offer tax incentives. The government isn\u2019t getting a tax now from businesses there because they aren\u2019t there, or from individuals who are on welfare rather than working. And why don\u2019t we offer incentives for business and industry to start up in those zones? Give them a tax moratorium for a period if they build and develop there. The individuals that would then get jobs \u2013 give them a break that encourages them to leave the social welfare programs and go to work. We could have an urban homestead act. We\u2019ve got thousands and thousands of homes owned by government boarded up, being vandalized, that have been taken in mortgage foreclosures. What if we had a homestead act, and said to the people, for $1 we sell you this house. All have to do is agree to refurbish it, make it habitable, and live in it \u2013 just as 100 or more years ago, we did with the open land in this country \u2013 urban . or country homesteading."}

It seems to totally belie the claim that I heard President Carter make a few days ago, that he was the first President that had come forth with a real urban strategy to meet the problems of urban America. Incidentally, just this past week, the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen, I guess, because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits. I\u2019m happy to say that, in contrast to that, the Anderson-Lucey platform for America, program for the 80s, has devoted considerable time, and in very specific detail, we have talked about two things that ought to be done to aid urban America. We call, first of all, for the creation of a $4 billion urban reinvestment trust fund to do exactly what you spoke about in your question \u2013 to rebuild the streets, to rebuild the cities, the leaking water mains. I was in North Pittsburgh \u2013 I think it was a few weeks ago, on my campaign \u2013 the water mains in that city had begun to leak, and literally, there wasn\u2019t money available to fix them. And until we can begin to recreate the basic infrastructure of the great cities of America, particularly in the upper Midwest and in the Northeast, they simply are not going to provide the kind of economic climate that will enable them to retain industry, enable them to retain the kind of solid industrial base that they need, so that they can provide jobs. We have also provided in our program for a $4 billion Community Trust Fund, and we\u2019ve told you where the money is coming from. It\u2019s going to come from the dedication, by 1984, of the excise revenues that today are being collected by the Federal Government on alcohol and tobacco. That money, I think, ought to be put into rebuilding the base of our cities. In addition to that, jobs programs to re-employ the youth in our cities would be very high on my priority list, both the Youth Opportunities Act of 1980 and a billion-dollar program that I would recommend to put youth to work in energy projects, in conservation projects, in projects that would carry out some of the great national goals of our country."}

I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan. His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information. He went so far as to call it \u201cbrutal economics.\u201d I\u2019ve been very careful \u2013 I have been very careful in saying that what I\u2019m going to do is to bring Federal spending under control first. I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done. But, you know, it\u2019s gotten to be about $122 difference. Somebody worked it out. And they figured out that between the tax cut that Governor Reagan is promising the American people, and the tax cut that Jimmy Carter is promising in 198I, his is worth about $122 more. So you, dear voters, are out there on the auction block, and these two candidates are bidding for your votes. And one is going to give you $122 more if you happen to be in that range of about a $20,000-a-year income. I\u2019m going to wait until I see that that inflation rate is going down, before I even begin to phase in the business tax cuts that I\u2019ve talked about. But I think, by improving productivity, they would be far less inflationary than the consumption-oriented tax cut that Governor Reagan is recommending."}

I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual. And for the state to interfere with a Constitutional amendment, and tell a woman that she must carry that pregnancy to term, regardless of her personal belief, that, I think, violates freedom of conscience as much as anything that I can think of.

And there might be some feeling of unfairness about this because he was not here to respond. But I believe it would have been much more unfair to have had John Anderson denied the right to participate in this debate. And I want to express my appreciation to the League of Women Voters for adopting a course with which I believe the great majority of Americans are in agreement. Now, as to my closing remarks: I\u2019ve always believed that this land was placed here between the two great oceans by some divine plan. That it was placed here to be found by a special kind of people \u2013 people who had a special love for freedom and who had the courage to uproot themselves and leave hearth and homeland, and came to what, in the beginning, was the most undeveloped wilderness possible. We came from 100 different corners of the earth. We spoke a multitude of tongues. We landed on this Eastern shore and then went out over the mountains and the prairies and the deserts and the far western mountains to the Pacific, building cities and towns and farms, and schools and churches. If wind, water or fire destroyed them, we built them again. And in so doing, at the same time, we built a new breed of human called an American \u2013 a proud, an independent., and a most compassionate individual, for the most part. Two hundred years ago, Tom Paine, when the 13 tiny colonies were trying to become a nation, said, we have it in our power to begin the world over again. Today. we\u2019re confronted with the horrendous problems that we\u2019ve discussed here tonight. And some people in high positions of leadership, tell us that the answer is to retreat. That the best is over. That we must cut back. That we must share in an ever-increasing scarcity. That we must, in the failure to be able to protect our national security as it is today, we must not be provocative to any possible adversary. Well, we, the living Americans, have gone through four wars. We\u2019ve gone through a Great Depression in our lifetime that literally was worldwide and almost brought us to our knees. But we came through all of those things and we achieved even new heights and new greatness. The living Americans today have fought harder, paid a higher price for freedom, and done more to advance the dignity of man than any people who ever lived on this earth. For 200 years, we\u2019ve lived in the future, believing that tomorrow would be better than today, and today would be better than yesterday. I still believe that. I\u2019m not running for the Presidency because I believe that I can solve the problems we\u2019ve discussed tonight. I believe the people of this country can, and together, we can begin the world over again. We can meet our destiny \u2013 and that destiny to build a land here that will be, for all mankind, a shining city on a hill. I think we ought to get at it."}

We have disagreed, I believe, on virtually every other issue. I respect him for showing tonight \u2013 for appearing here, and I thank the League of Women Voters for the opportunity that they have given me. I am running for President as an Independent because I believe our country is in trouble. I believe that all of us are going to have to begin to work together to solve our problems. If you think that I am a spoiler, consider these facts: Do you really think that our economy is healthy? Do you really think that 8 million Americans being out of work and the 50% unemployment among the youth of our country are acceptable? Do you really think that our armed forces are really acceptably strong in those areas of conventional capability where they should be? Do you think that our political institutions are working the way they should when literally only half of our citizens vote? I don\u2019t think you do think that. And therefore, I think you ought to consider doing something about it, and voting for an Independent in 1980. You know, a generation of office seekers has tried to tell the American people that they could get something for nothing. It\u2019s been a time, therefore, of illusion and false hopes, and the longer it continues, the more dangerous it becomes. We\u2019ve got to stop drifting. What I wish tonight so desperately is that we had had more time to talk about some of the other issues that are so fundamentally important. A great historian, Henry Steele Commager, said that in their lust for victory, neither traditional party is looking beyond November. And he went on to cite three issues that their platforms totally ignore: atomic warfare, Presidential Directive 59 notwithstanding. If we don\u2019t resolve that issue, all others become irrelevant. The issue of our natural resources; the right of posterity to inherit the earth, and what kind of earth will it be? The issue of nationalism \u2013 the recognition, he says, that every major problem confronting us is global, and cannot be solved by nationalism here or elsewhere \u2013 that is chauvinistic, that is parochial, that is as anachronistic as states\u2019 rights was in the days of Jefferson Davis. Those are some of the great issues \u2013 atomic warfare, the use of our natural resources, and the issue of nationalism \u2013 that I intend to be talking about in the remaining six weeks of this campaign, and I dare hope that the American people will be listening and that they will see that an Independent government of John Anderson and Patrick Lucey can give us the kind of coalition government that we need in 1980 to begin to solve our problems. Thank you."}

I think I\u2019m a much wiser and more experienced man than I was when I debated four years ago against President Ford. I\u2019ve also learned that there are no simple answers to complicated questions. H. L. Mencken said that for every problem there\u2019s a simple answer. It would be neat and plausible and wrong. The fact is that this nation, in the eight years before I became President, had its own military strength decreased. Seven out of eight years, the budget commitments for defense went down, 37% in all. Since I\u2019ve been in office, we\u2019ve had a steady, carefully planned, methodical but, very effective increase in our commitment for defense. But what we\u2019ve done is use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace. We\u2019ve not only kept peace for our own country, but we\u2019ve been able to extend the benefits of peace to others. In the Middle East, we\u2019ve worked for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, successfully, and have tied ourselves together with Israel and Egypt in a common defense capability. This is a very good step forward for our nation\u2019s security, and we\u2019ll continue to do as we have done in the past. I might also add that there are decisions that are made in the Oval Office by every President which are profound in nature. There are always trouble spots in the world, and how those troubled areas are addressed by a President alone in that Oval Office affects our nation directly, the involvement of the United States and also our American interests. That is a basic decision that has to be made so frequently, by every President who serves. That is what I have tried to do successfully by keeping our country at peace."}

I also would like to point out that Republican presidents in those years, faced with a Democratic majority in both houses of the Congress, found that their requests for defense budgets were very often cut. Now, Gerald Ford left a five-year projected plan for a military build-up to restore our defenses, and President Carter\u2019s administration reduced that by 38%, cut 60 ships out of the Navy building program that had been proposed, and stopped the the B-l, delayed the cruise missile, stopped the production line for the Minuteman missile, stopped the Trident or delayed the Trident submarine, and now is planning a mobile military force that can be delivered to various spots in the world which does make me question his assaults on whether I am the one who is quick to look for use of force."}

In 1974, we had a so-called oil shock, wherein the price of OPEC oil was raised to an extraordinary degree. We had an even worse oil shock in 1979. In 1974, we had the worst recession, the deepest and most penetrating recession since the Second World War. The recession that resulted this time was the briefest since the Second World War. In addition, we\u2019ve brought down inflation. Earlier this year, in the first quarter, we did have a very severe inflation pressure brought about by the OPEC price increase. It averaged about 18% in the first quarter of this year. In the second quarter, we had dropped it down to about 13%. The most recent figures, the last three months, on the third quarter of this year, the inflation rate is 7% \u2013 still too high, but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of jobs \u2013 nine million new jobs in the last three and a half years \u2013 that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us. I notice that Governor Reagan recently mentioned the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal. which his own running mate, George Bush, described as voodoo economics, and said that it would result in a 30% inflation rate. And Business Week, which is not a Democratic publication, said that this Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal \u2013 and I quote them, I think \u2013 was completely irresponsible and would result in inflationary pressures which would destroy this nation. So our proposals are very sound and very carefully considered to stimulate jobs, to improve the industrial complex of this country, to create tools for American workers, and at the same time would be anti-inflationary in nature. So to add nine million new jobs, to control inflation, and to plan for the future with an energy policy now intact as a foundation is our plan for the years ahead."}

At the same time, as I have said earlier, we have added about nine million net new jobs in that period of time \u2013 a record never before achieved. Also, the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors: One is conservation, which requires sacrifice, and the other one, increase in production of American energy, which is going along very well \u2013 more coal this year than ever before in American history, more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history. The new economic revitalization program that we have in mind, which will be implemented next year, would result in tax credits which would let business invest in new tools and new factories to create even more new jobs \u2013 about one million in the next two years.

When Mr. Carter became President, inflation was 4.8%, as you said. It had been cut in two by President Gerald Ford. It is now running at 12.7%. President Carter also has spoken of the new jobs created. Well, we always, with the normal growth in our country and increase in population, increase the number of jobs. But that can\u2019t hide the fact that there are eight million men and women out of work in America today, and two million of those lost their jobs in just the last few months. Mr. Carter had also promised that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight against inflation. And yet, his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation, because in January, at the beginning of the year, it was more than 18%. Since then, he has blamed the people for inflation, OPEC, he has blamed the Federal Reserve system, he has blamed the lack of productivity of the American people, he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share in scarcity, we must sacrifice and get used to doing with less. We don\u2019t have inflation because the people are living too well. We have inflation because the Government is living too well. And the last statement, just a few days ago, was a speech to the effect that we have inflation because Government revenues have not kept pace with Government spending. I see my time is running out here. I\u2019ll have to get this out very fast. Yes, you can lick inflation by increasing productivity and by decreasing the cost of government to the place that we have balanced budgets, and are no longer grinding out printing press money, flooding the market with it because the Government is spending more than it takes in. And my economic plan calls for that. The President\u2019s economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way. But we will have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if we follow that path."}

Now, the President spoke a moment ago about that I was against the minimum wage. I wish he could have been with me when I sat with a group of teenagers who were black, and who were telling me about their unemployment problems, and that it was the minimum wage that had done away with the jobs that they once could get. And indeed, every time it has increased you will find there is an increase in minority unemployment among young people. And therefore, I have been in favor of a separate minimum for them.

In all those elements, Governor Reagan has repeatedly spoken out against them, which, to me, shows a very great insensitivity to giving deprived families a better chance in life.

There is no doubt in my mind that in the downtown central cities, with the, with the new commitment on an energy policy, with a chance to revitalize homes and to make them more fuel efficient, with a chance for our synthetic fuels program, solar power, this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends."}

And I said, well, yes. And I think that anyone that\u2019s seeking this position, as well as other people, probably, have thought to themselves, what about this, what about that? These are just ideas of what I would think of if I were in that position and had access to the information, and which I would know all the options that were open to me. I have never answered the question, however; second, the one that says, well, tell me, what are some of those ideas? First of all, I would be fearful that I might say something that was presently under way or in negotiations, and thus expose it and endanger the hostages, and sometimes, I think some of my ideas might require quiet diplomacy where you don\u2019t say in advance, or say to anyone, what it is you\u2019re thinking of doing. Your question is difficult to answer, because, in the situation right now, no one wants to say anything that would inadvertently delay, in any way, the return of those hostages if there if there is a chance that they\u2019re coming home soon, or that might cause them harm.

And then, as we build up our national security, to restore our margin of safety, we at the same time try to restrain the Soviet build-up, which has been going forward at a rapid pace, and for quite some time. The SALT II treaty was the result of negotiations that Mr. Carter\u2019s team entered into after he had asked the Soviet Union for a discussion of actual reduction of nuclear strategic weapons. And his emissary, I think, came home in 12 hours having heard a very definite nyet. But taking that one no from the Soviet Union, we then went back into negotiations on their terms, because Mr. Carter had canceled the B-I bomber, delayed the MX, delayed the Trident submarine, delayed the cruise missile, shut down the Missile Man \u2013 the three \u2013 the Minuteman missile production line, and whatever other things that might have been done. The Soviet Union sat at the table knowing that we had gone forward with unilateral concessions without any reciprocation from them whatsoever. Now, I have not blocked the SALT II treaty, as Mr. Carter and Mr. Mondale suggest I have. It has been blocked by a Senate in which there is a Democratic majority. Indeed, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 0, with seven abstentions, against the SALT II treaty, and declared that it was not in the national security interests of the United States.

It calls for a mutual reduction of these weapons, as I say, that neither of us can represent a threat to the other. And to suggest that the SALT II treaty that your negotiators negotiated was just a continuation, and based on all of the preceding efforts by two previous Presidents, is just not true. It was a new negotiation because, as I say, President Ford was within about 10% of having a solution that could be acceptable.

It can only be done in two ways: one, to conserve energy \u2013 to stop the waste of energy \u2013 and, secondly, to produce more American energy. We\u2019ve been very successful in both cases. We\u2019ve now reduced the importing of foreign oil in the last year alone by one-third. We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same date just a year ago. This commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our nation in the future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels, yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy, yes; and also to produce the traditional kinds of American energy. We will drill more oil and gas wells this year than any year in history. We\u2019ll produce more coal this year than any year in history. We are exporting more coal this year than any year in history. And we have an opportunity now with improved transportation systems and improved loading facilities in our ports, to see a very good opportunity on a world international market, to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source. This exciting future will not only give us more energy security, but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that we\u2019ve put into effect."}

The mines are closed down; there are 22000 miners out of work. Most of this is due to regulations which either interfere with the mining of it or prevent the burning of it:. With our modern technology, yes, we can burn our coal within the limits of the Clean Air Act. I think, as technology improves, we\u2019ll be able to do even better with that. The other thing is that we have only leased out \u2013 begun to explore \u2013 2% of our outer continental shelf for oil, where it is believed, by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy, that there are vast supplies yet to be found. Our Government has, in the last year or so, taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were \u2013 well, they were public lands subject to multiple use \u2013 exploration for minerals and so forth. It is believed that probably 70% of the potential oil in the United States is probably hidden in those lands, and no one is allowed to even go and explore to find out if it is there. This is particularly true of the recent efforts to shut down part of Alaska. Nuclear power: There were 36 power plants planned in this country. And let me add the word safety; it must be done with the utmost of safety. But 32 of those have given up and canceled their plans to build, and again, because Government regulations and permits, and so forth, take \u2013 make it take \u2013 more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the United States as it does to build one in Japan or in Western Europe.

We have, with our five-year plan for the leasing of offshore lands, proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954.

We also need to continue to index Social Security payments, so that if inflation rises, the Social Security payments would rise a commensurate degree to let the buying power of a Social Security check continue intact. In the past, the relationship between Social Security and Medicare has been very important to providing some modicum of aid for senior citizens in the retention of health benefits. Governor Reagan, as a matter of fact, began his political career campaigning around this nation against Medicare. Now, we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance, with an emphasis on the prevention of disease, an emphasis on out-patient care, not in-patient care; an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care far those who are ill, an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance, so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because of a very high medical bill, then the insurance would help pay for it.

I think it\u2019s been a very constructive debate and I hope it\u2019s helped to acquaint the American people with the sharp differences between myself and Governor Reagan. Also, I want to thank the people of Cleveland and Ohio for being such hospitable hosts during these last few hours in my life. I\u2019ve been President now for almost four years. I\u2019ve had to make thousands of decisions, and each one of those decisions has been a learning process. I\u2019ve seen the strength of my nation, and I\u2019ve seen the crises it approached in a tentative way. And I\u2019ve had to deal with those crises as best I could. As I\u2019ve studied the record between myself and Governor Reagan, I\u2019ve been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us. I think the result of this debate indicates that that fact is true. I consider myself in the mainstream of my party. I consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of Presidents who served before me. The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure. We must have a society that\u2019s just and fair. And we must extend the benefits of our own commitment to peace, to create a peaceful world. I believe that since I\u2019ve been in office, there have been six or eight areas of combat evolved in other parts of the world. In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country. I\u2019ve done that with moderation, with care, with thoughtfulness; sometimes consulting experts. But, I\u2019ve learned in this last three and a half years that when an issue is extremely difficult, when the call is very close, the chances are the experts will be divided almost 50-50. And the final judgment about the future of the nation \u2013 war, peace, involvement, reticence, thoughtfulness, care, consideration, concern \u2013 has to be made by the man in the Oval Office. It\u2019s a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people in the process, with an open Government, the job is a very gratifying one. The American people now are facing, next Tuesday, a lonely decision. Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country. And I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference. If one vote per precinct had changed in 1960, John Kennedy would never have been President of this nation. And if a few more people had gone to the polls and voted in 1968, Hubert Humphrey would have been President; Richard Nixon would not. There is a partnership involved in our nation. To stay strong, to stay at peace, to raise high the banner of human rights, to set an example for the rest of the world, to let our deep beliefs and commitments be felt by others in other nations, is my plan for the future. I ask the American people to join me in this partnership."}

First of all is to recognize a tremendous economic strength in this country and to set the putting to \u2013 back to work of our people as a top priority. This is uh \u2013 an effort that ought to be done primarily by strong leadership in the White House, the inspiration of our people, the tapping of uh \u2013 business, agriculture, industry, labor and government at all levels to work on this uh project. We\u2019ll never have uh \u2013 an end to the inflationary spiral, and we\u2019ll never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work. There are several things that can be done specifically that are not now being done. First of all, to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide uh large numbers of jobs. Secondly, we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh \u2013 to cooperate with government in matters like housing. Here a very small investment of taxpayer\u2019s money \u2013 in the housing field can bring large numbers of extra jobs, and the guarantee of mortgage loans, and the uh \u2013 putting forward of uh \u2013 two-0-two programs for housing for older people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exists in the \u2013 in the construction industry. Another thing is to deal with our \u2013 uh needs in the central cities, where the unemployment rate is extremely high: sometimes among minority groups, or those who don\u2019t speak English, or who\u2019re black, or young people, or \u2013 40 percent of the employment. Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah \u2013 cha- in \u2013 in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work. Another very important \u2013 uh aspect of our \u2013 uh economy would be to increase production in every way possible, uh to hold down \u2013 uh taxes on individuals, and to uh shift the tax burdens onto those who have avoided paying taxes in the past. These uh \u2013 kinds of specific things, uh none of which are being done now, would be a great help in \u2013 in reducing uh unemployment. There is uh \u2013 uh an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very \u2013 very succinctly, and that is, to make sure that we have a good relationship between management \u2013 business on the one hand, and labor, on the other. In a > Transfer interrupted! ery high, we might channel specific uh targeted job \u2013 job \u2013 uh opportunities by paying part of the salary of unemployed people \u2013 uh and also sharing with uh \u2013 local governments the uh \u2013 payment of salaries which would uh \u2013 let us cut down the unemployment rate much lower, before we hit the inflationary level. But I believe that by the end of the first four years of uh \u2013 of the next term we could have the unemployment down to 3 percent adult unemployment, which is about uh \u2013 4 to 4 and a half percent overall uh controlled inflation rate and have a uh balance of growth of about \u2013 uh 4 to 6 percent, around 5 percent which would give us a balanced budget."}

It would\u2019ve called for export controls on agricultural products In my judgment the best way to get jobs is to uh \u2013 expand the private sector, where five out of six jobs today exist in our economy. We can do that by reducing Federal taxes as I proposed uh \u2013 about a year ago when I called for a tax reduction of $28 billion \u2013 three-quarters of it to go to private uh taxpayers and uh one-quarter to the business sector. We could add to jobs in the major metropolitan areas by a proposal that I recommended that would give tax incentives to business to move into the inner city and to expand or to build new plants so that they would take a plant, or expand a plant where people are, and people are currently unemployed.

And I recommended that to the Congress with a budget ceiling of three hundred and ninety-five billion dollars, and that would have permitted us to have a $25 billion tax reduction. In my tax reduction program for middle-income taxpayers, I recommended that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person. That would mean, of course, that for a family of four that that family would have a thousand dollars more personal exemption \u2013 money that they could spend for their own purposes, money that the government wouldn\u2019t have to spend. But if we keep the lid on federal spending, which I think we can \u2013 with the help of the Congress, we can justify fully a $28 billion tax reduction. In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending. For the last ten years the budget of the United States has grown from uh \u2013 about 11 percent per year. We can\u2019t afford that kind of growth in federal spending. And in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half \u2013 a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one-half percent. With that kind of limitation, on federal spending, we can fully justify the tax reductions that I have proposed. And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that we\u2019ll get more revenue and we\u2019ll have a more prosperous economy."}

I think it\u2019s accurate to say that in uh \u2013 two years ago when Mr. Nixon \u2013 Mr. Ford put in this uh amnesty that three times as many deserters were uh \u2013 excused as were \u2013 as were the uh \u2013 the ones who evaded the draft. But I think that now is the time to heal our country after the Vietnam War and I think that what the people are concerned about is not the \u2013 uh pardon or the amnesty of uh \u2013 those who evaded the draft, but \u2013 but whether or not our crime system is \u2013 is fair. We\u2019ve got a \u2013 a sharp distinction drawn between white collar crime \u2013 the \u2013 the \u2013 the big shots who are rich, who are influential uh very seldom go to jail; those who are poor and \u2013 and who have uh no influence \u2013 uh quite often are the ones who are punished. And \u2013 and the whole uh subject of crime is one that concerns our people very much, and I believe that the fairness of it is \u2013 is what \u2013 uh \u2013 is a \u2013 is a major problem that addresses our \u2013 our leader and this is something that hasn\u2019t been addressed adequately by \u2013 by this administration. But I \u2013 I hope to have a complete uh responsibility on my shoulders to help bring about a \u2013 a fair uh \u2013 criminal justice system and also to \u2013 to bring about uh \u2013 an end to the \u2013 to the divise- divisiveness that has occurred in our country uh as a result of the Vietnam War."}

When I took aver we had uh a bureaucratic mess, like we have in Washington now, and we had three hundred agencies, departments, bureaus, commissions \u2013 uh some uh \u2013 fully budgeted, some not, but all having responsibility to carry out that was in conflict. And we cut those three hundred \u2013 uh agencies and so forth down substantially. We eliminated two hundred and seventy-eight of them. We set up a simple structure of government that could be administrated fairly and it was a \u2013 a tremendous success. It hasn\u2019t been undone since I was there. It resulted also in an ability to reshape our court system, our prison system, our education system, our mental health programs and \u2013 and a clear assignment of responsibility and \u2013 and authority and also to have uh our people once again understanding control our government. I intend to do the same thing if I\u2019m elected president. When I get to Washington, coming in as an outsider, one of the major responsibilities that \u2013 that I will have on my shoulder is a complete reorganization of the \u2013 of the executive branch of government. We now have uh \u2013 a greatly expanded White House staff. When Mr. Nixon went in office, for instance, we had three and a half million dollars spent on \u2013 on the White House and its staff. That has escalated now to sixteen and a half million dollars, in the last uh Republican administration. This needs to be changed. We need to put the responsibilities back on the cabinet members. We also need to have a great reduction in agencies and programs. For instance, we now have uh \u2013 in the health area three hundred and two different programs administered by eleven major departments and agencies, sixty other advisory commissions responsible for this. Medicaid\u2019s in one agency; Medicare is in a different one. The \u2013 the check on the quality of health care is in a different one. None of them uh are responsible for health care itself. This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program. We have uh \u2013 just advocated uh \u2013 this past week a consolidation of the responsibilities for energy. Our country now has no comprehensive energy program or policy. We have twenty different agencies in the federal government responsible for the production, the regulation, the uh \u2013 information about energy, the conservation of energy, spread all over government. This is a \u2013 a gross waste of money, so tough, competent management of government, giving us a simple efficient purposeful and manageable government would be a great step forward and if I\u2019m elected \u2013 and I intend to be \u2013 then it\u2019s gonna be done."}

In the last three months before an election, they\u2019re always for the programs that they always fight the other three-and-one-half years. Uh \u2013 I remember when uh \u2013 Herbert Hoover was against uh \u2013 jobs for people. I remember when Alf Landon was against Social Security and uh \u2013 later President Nixon, sixteen years ago, was telling the public that John Kennedy\u2019s proposals would bankrupt the country and would double the cost. The best thing to do is to look at the record uh \u2013 of Mr. Ford\u2019s Administration and Mr. Nixon\u2019s before his. Uh \u2013 we had last year a $65 billion deficit \u2013 the largest deficit in the history of our country \u2013 more of a deficit spending than we had in the entire eight-year period under President Johnson and President Kennedy. We\u2019ve got five hundred thousand more Americans out of jobs today than were out of work three months ago and since Mr. Ford\u2019s been in office two years, we\u2019ve had a 50 percent increase in unemployment from five million people out of work to two and a half million more people out of work and a total of seven and a half million. We\u2019ve also got uh \u2013 a comparison between himself and Mr. Nixon. He\u2019s got four times the size of the deficits that Mr. Nixon even had himself. This uh \u2013 talking about more people at work \u2013 uh is distorted because with a 14 percent increase in the cost of living in the last uh \u2013 two years, it means that \u2013 that women and young people have had to go to work when they didn\u2019t want to because their fathers didn\u2019t make enough to pay the increased cost of uh \u2013 food and uh housing and clothing. We have uh \u2013 in this last uh two years alone a hundred and twenty billion dollars total deficits under President Ford and uh \u2013 at the same time we\u2019ve had, in the last eight years, a doubling in the number of bankruptcies for small business: we\u2019ve had a negative growth in our \u2013 in our national economy measured in real dollars. The take-home pay of a worker in this country is actually less now than it was in 1968 \u2013 measured in real dollars. This is the kind of record that\u2019s there and talk about the future and a drastic change or conversion on the part of Mr. Ford as of last minute is one that just doesn\u2019t go."}

I think I know the \u2013 the uh capabilities and limitations of atomic power. But the energy \u2013 uh policy of our nation is one that uh has not yet been established under this administration. I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy except us. We have seen uh \u2013 the Federal Energy Agency established, for instance. Uh \u2013 in the crisis of 1973 it was supposed to be a temporary agency, uh now it\u2019s permanent, it\u2019s enormous, it\u2019s growing every day. I think the Wall Street Journal uh reported not too long ago they have a hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people its own existence. We\u2019ve got to have a \u2013 a firm way to handle the energy question. The reorganization proposal that I have put forward is one uh first step. In addition to that, we need to have \u2013 uh a realization that we\u2019ve got uh about thirty-five years worth of oil left in the whole world. We\u2019re gonna run out of oil. When Mr. Nixon made his famous uh speech on Operation Independence we were importing about 35 percent of our oil. Now we\u2019ve increased that amount 25 percent. We now import about 44 percent of our oil. We need to shift from oil to coal. We need to concentrate our research and development effort on uh coal burning and extraction, with safer mines, but also it\u2019s clean burning. We need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures. And then as a last resort only, continue to use atomic power. I would certainly uh \u2013 not cut out atomic power altogether. We can\u2019t afford to give up that opportunity until later. But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained. For instance, some that have been forgotten; we need to have the reactor core \u2013 below ground level, the entire power plant that uses atomic uh \u2013 power tightly sealed and a heavy \u2013 heavy vacuum maintained. There ought to be a standardized design. There ought to be a full-time uh \u2013 atomic energy specialist, independent of the power company in the control room, full time, twenty-four hours a day, to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops. These kinds of uh \u2013 procedures, along with evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated. So, shift from oil to coal, emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power, strict conservation measures, not yield every time that the special interest groups uh \u2013 put pressure on the president like uh this administration has done, and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strictest possible safety precautions. That\u2019s the best overall energy policy in the brief time we have to discuss it."}

And whenever the uh \u2013 automobile manufacturers come forward and say they can\u2019t meet the uh \u2013 amendments that the Congress has put forward, this Republican administration has delayed the implementation dates. In addition to that, we ought to have a \u2013 a shift toward the use of coal, particularly in the Appalachian regions where the coal is located. A lot of uh \u2013 very high quality, low-carbon coal, uh \u2013 low-sulfur coal is there, it\u2019s where our employment is needed. Uh \u2013 this would \u2013 would help a great deal. So mandatory conservation measures \u2013 yes. Encouragement by the president for people to uh voluntarily conserve \u2013 yes. And also the private sector ought to be encouraged to \u2013 to bring forward to the public the benefits from efficiency. One bank in uh \u2013 Washington, fo- for instance, gives lower interest loans for people who adequately insulate their homes or who buy efficient automobiles. And some major uh \u2013 uh \u2013 manufacturing companies, like Dow Chemical, have through uh \u2013 very effective efficiency mechanism cut down the use of energy by uh \u2013 as much as 40 percent with the same out-product.

I recommended to the Congress that we should increase production in this country from six hundred million tons a year to twel- a- a billion two hundred million tons by 1985. In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground; we have to improve our utilization of coal \u2013 make it more efficient, make it cleaner. In addition we uh \u2013 have to expand our research and development. In my program for energy independence we have increased, for example, solar energy research from about $84 million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year. We\u2019re going as fast as the experts say we should. In nuclear power we have increased the research and development, uh \u2013 under the Energy Research and Development Agency uh \u2013 very substantially, to insure that our ener- uh \u2013 nuclear power plants are safer, that they are more efficient, and that we have adequate safeguards.

I was in uh \u2013 a city in uh \u2013 Pennsylvania not too long ago, near here, and uh \u2013 there were about four or five thousand people in the audience \u2013 it was on a \u2013 on a train trip. And I said, \u201cHow many uh \u2013 adults here are out of work?\u201d About a thousand raised their hands. Mr. Ford uh \u2013 actually has fewer people now in the private sector in non-farm jobs than when he took office. And still he talks about \u2013 uh success. Seven point nine percent unemployment is a terrible tragedy in this country. He says he\u2019s learned how to match unemployment with inflation. That\u2019s right. We\u2019ve got the highest inflation we\u2019ve had in twenty-five years right now, except under this administration, and that was fifty years ago. And we\u2019ve got uh \u2013 the highest unemployment we\u2019ve had uh \u2013 under Mr. Ford\u2019s administration, since the Great Depression. This affects human beings, and \u2013 and his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration, and not a work administration. He hasn\u2019t saved $9 billion with his vetoes. There\u2019s only been uh \u2013 a net savings of $4 billion. And the cost in unemployment compensation, welfare compensation, and lost revenues has increased $23 billion in the last two years. This is a \u2013 a typical attitude that really causes havoc in people\u2019s lives, and then it\u2019s covered over by saying that our country has naturally got a 6 percent unemployment rate, or 7 percent unemployment rate and a 6 percent inflation. It\u2019s a travesty. It shows a lack of leadership. And we\u2019ve never had a president since the War between the States that vetoed more bills. Mr. Ford has vetoed four times as many bills as Mr. Nixon \u2013 per year. And eleven of \u2019em have been overridden.

Over 50 percent \u2013 53 to be exact \u2013 percent of the tax benefits go to the 14 percent richest people in this country, and we\u2019ve had a 50 percent increase in payroll deductions since Mr. Nixon went in office eight years ago. Mr. Ford has \u2013 has advocated since he\u2019s been in office over $5 billion in reductions for corporations, special interest groups, and the very, very wealthy who derive their income \u2013 not from labor \u2013 but from investments. That\u2019s got to be changed. A few things that can be done: we have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporations who invest overseas \u2013 if they make a million dollars in profits overseas \u2013 they don\u2019t have to pay any of their taxes unless they bring their money back into this country. When they don\u2019t pay their taxes, the average American pays the taxes for them. Not only that, but it robs this country of jobs, because instead of coming back with that million dollars and creating a shoe factory, say in New Hampshire or Vermont, if the company takes the money down to Italy and \u2013 and builds a shoe factory, they don\u2019t have to pay any taxes on the money. Another thing is a system called DISC which was originally designed, proposed by Mr. Nixon, to encourage exports. This permits a company to create uh \u2013 a dummy corporation, to export their products, and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them. This costs our uh \u2013 government about uh \u2013 $1.4 billion a year. And when those rich corporations don\u2019t pay that tax, the average American taxpayer pays it for \u2019em. Another one that\u2019s uh \u2013 that\u2019s very important is the uh \u2013 is the business deductions, uh \u2013 jet airplanes, uh \u2013 first class travel, the fifty-dollar martini lunch. The average working person can\u2019t \u2013 uh \u2013 can\u2019t take advantage of that, but the \u2013 the wealthier people \u2013 uh can. Uh \u2013 another system is where uhh \u2013 a dentist can invest money in say, raising cattle and uh \u2013 can put in a hundred thousand dollars of his own money, borrow nine hundred thousand dollars \u2013 nine hundred mi- thousand dollars \u2013 that makes a million \u2013 and mark off a great amount of uh \u2013 of loss uh \u2013 through that procedure. Uh \u2013 there was one example, for instance, where uh \u2013 somebody uh \u2013 produced pornographic movies. They put in $30 thousand of their own money and got a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in tax savings. Well, these special kinds of programs have \u2013 have robbed the average taxpayer and have benefited those who are powerful, and who can employ lobbyists, and who can have their CPAs and their lawyers to help them benefit from the roughly uh \u2013 eight thousand pages of the tax code. The average uh American person can\u2019t do it. You can\u2019t hire a lobbyist uh out of unemployment compensation checks."}

One of the major issues in this campaign is trust. A president should never promise more than he can deliver and a president should always deliver everything that he\u2019s promised. A president can\u2019t be all things to all people. A president should be the same thing to all people. Another issue in this campaign, Governor Carter has endorsed the Democratic platform, which calls for more spending, bigger deficits, more inflation or mare taxes. Governor Carter has embraced the record of the present Congress, dominated by his political party. It calls for more of the same. Governor Carter in his acceptance speech called for more and more programs, which means more and more government. I think the real issue in this campaign, and that which you must decide on November second, is whether you should vote for his promise or my performance in two years in the White House. On the fourth of July we had a wonderful two hundredth birthday \u2013 for our great country. It was a superb occasion. It was a glorious day. In the first century of our nation\u2019s history our forefathers gave us the finest form of government in the history of mankind. In the second century of our nation\u2019s history, our forefathers developed the most productive industrial nation in the history of the globe. Our third century should be the century of individual freedom for all our two hundred and fifteen million Americans today and all that join us. In the last few years government has gotten bigger and bigger; industry has gotten larger and larger; labor unions have gotten bigger and bigger; and our children have been the victims of mass education. We must make this next century the century of the individual. We should never forget that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have. The individual worker in the plants throughout the United States should not be a small cog in a big machine. The member of a labor union must have his rights strengthened and broadened and our children in their education should have an opportunity to improve themselves based on their talents and their abilities. My mother and father, during the Depression, worked very hard to give me an opportunity to do better in our great country. Your mothers and fathers did the same thing for you and others. Betty and I have worked very hard to give our children a brighter future in the United States, our beloved country. You and others in this great country have worked hard and done a great deal to give your children and your grandchildren the blessings of a better America. I believe we can all work together to make the individuals in the future have more and all of us working together can build a better America."}

Governor Carter in November of 1975 indicated that he wanted to cut the defense budget by $15 billion. A few months later, he said he wanted to cut the defense budget by eight or nine billion dollars. And more recently, he talks about cutting the defense budget by five to seven billion dollars. There is no way you can be strong militarily and have those kind of reductions in our military uh \u2013 appropriation. Now let me just tell you a little story. About uh \u2013 late October of 1975, I asked the then Secretary of Defense, Mr. Schlesinger, to tell me what had to be done if we were going to reduce the defense budget by uh \u2013 three to five billion dollars. A few days later, Mr. Schlesinger came back and said if we cut the defense budget by three to five billion dollars, we will have to cut military personnel by two hundred and fifty thousand, civilian personnel by a hundred thousand, jobs in America by a hundred thousand. We would have to stretch out our aircraft procurement, we would have to reduce our naval construction program, we would have to reduce the uh \u2013 research and development for the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and Marines by 8 percent. We would have to close twenty military bases in the United States immediately. That\u2019s the kind of defense program that uh \u2013 Mr. Carter wants. Let me tell you this straight from the shoulder. You don\u2019t negotiate with Mr. Brezhnev from weakness.

I don\u2019t uh \u2013 look at the picture as bleakly as you have indicated in your question, Mr. Trewhitt. I believe that the United States ha- had many successes in recent years, in recent months, as far as the Communist movement is concerned. We have been successful in Portugal, where a year ago it looked like there was a very great possibility that the uh \u2013 Communists would take over in Portugal. It didn\u2019t happen. We have a democracy in Portugal today. A few uh \u2013 months ago, or I should say, maybe two years ago, the Soviet Union looked like they had continued strength in the Middle East. Today, according to Prime Minister Rabin, the Soviet Union is weaker in the Middle East than they have been in many, many years. The facts are, there \u2013 the Soviet Union relationship with Egypt is uh \u2013 at a low level. The Soviet Union relationship with Syria is at a very low point. The United States today, according to Prime Minister Rabin of Israel, is a- at a peak in its uh \u2013 influence and power in the Middle East. But let\u2019s turn for a minute to the uhh \u2013 southern African operations that are now going on. The United States of America took the initiative in southern Africa. We wanted to end the bloodshed in southern Africa. We wanted to have the right of self-determination in southern Africa. We wanted to have majority rule with the full protection of the rights of the minority. We wanted to preserve human dignity in southern Africa. We have taken the initiative, and in southern Africa today the United States is trusted by the black front-line nations and black Africa. The United States is trusted by other elements in southern Africa. The United States foreign policy under this administration has been one of progress and success. And I believe that instead of talking about Soviet progress, we can talk about American successes. And may I make an observation \u2013 part of the question you asked, Mr. Trewhitt? I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s in the best interest of the United States and the NATO nations to have a Communist government in NATO. Mr. Carter has indicated he would look with sympathy to a Communist government in NATO. I think that would destroy the integrity and the strength of NATO, and I am totally opposed to it."}

And let me cite several examples. Shortly after I became president in uh \u2013 December of 1974, I met with uh \u2013 General Secretary Brezhnev in Vladivostok and we agreed to a mutual cap on the ballistic missile launchers at a ceiling of twenty-four hundred \u2013 which means that the Soviet Union, if that becomes a permanent agreement, will have to make a reduction in their launchers that they now have or plan to have. I\u2019ve negotiated at Vladivostok with uh \u2013 Mr. Brezhnev a limitation on the MIRVing of their ballistic missiles at a figure of thirteen-twenty, which is the first time that any president has achieved a cap either on launchers or on MIRVs. It seems to me that we can go from there to uh \u2013 the uh \u2013 grain sales. The grain sales have been a benefit to American agriculture. We have achieved a five and three quarter year uh \u2013 sale of a minimum six million metric tons, which means that they have already bought about four million metric tons this year and are bound to buy another two million metric tons to take the grain and corn and wheat that the American farmers have produced in order to uh \u2013 have full production. And these grain sales to the Soviet Union have helped us tremendously in meeting the costs of the additional oil and \u2013 the oil that we have bought from overseas. If we turn to Helsinki \u2013 I\u2019m glad you raised it, Mr. uh \u2013 Frankel. In the case of Helsinki, thirty-five nations signed an agreement, including the secretary of state for the Vatican \u2013 I can\u2019t under any circumstances believe that the \u2013 His Holiness, the Pope would agree by signing that agreement that the thirty-five nations have turned over to the Warsaw Pact nations the domination of the \u2013 Eastern Europe. It just isn\u2019t true. And if Mr. Carter alleges that His Holiness by signing that has done it, he is totally inaccurate. Now, what has been accomplished by the Helsinki agreement? Number one, we have an agreement where they notify us and we notify them of any uh \u2013 military maneuvers that are to be be undertaken. They have done it. In both cases where they\u2019ve done so, there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford administration."}

FREDERICK","Speaker":"MR. CARTER","Party":"Democratic","Factor 1":15,"Factor 2":18,"Factor 3":9,"Factor 4":1,"Factor 5":7,"Factor 6":-1,"Text":"I would never single out food as a trade embargo item. If I ever decided to impose an embargo because of a crisis in international relationships, it would include all shipments of all equipment. For instance, if the Arab countries ever again declare an embargo against our nation on oil I would consider that not a military but an economic declaration of war, and I would respond instantly and in kind. I would not ship that Arab country anything \u2013 no weapons, no spare parts for weapons, no oil-drilling rigs, no oil pipe, no nothing. I wouldn\u2019t single out just food. Another thing that I\u2019d like to say is this: In our international trade, as I said in my op- opening statement, we have become the arms merchant of the world. When this Republican administration came into office we were shipping about $1 billion worth of arms overseas, now ten to twelve billion dollars worth of arms overseas to countries that quite often use these weapons to fight each other. The shift in emphasis has been very disturbing to me, speaking about the Middle East. Under the last Democratic administration 60 percent of all weapons that went into the Middle East were for Israel. Nowadays \u2013 75 percent were for Israel before. Now 60 percent go to the Arab countries, and this does not include Iran. If you include Iran, our present shipment of weapons to the Middle East, only 20 percent goes to Israel. This is a deviation from idealism; it\u2019s a deviation from a commitment to our major ally in the Middle East, which is Israel; it\u2019s a yielding to economic pressure on the part of the Arabs on the oil issue; and it\u2019s also a tremendous indication that under the Ford administration we have not addressed the energy policy adequately. We still have no comprehensive energy policy in this country. And it\u2019s an overall sign of weakness. When we are weak at home economically \u2013 high unemployment, high inflation, a confused government, a wasteful defense establishment, this encourages the kind of pressure that\u2019s been put on us successfully. It would\u2019ve been inconceivable ten \u2013 fifteen years ago, for us to be brought to our knees with an Arab oil embargo. But it was done three years ago and they\u2019re still putting pressure on us from the Arab countries to our discredit around the world. These are the weaknesses that I see, and I believe it\u2019s not just a matter of idealism. It\u2019s a matter of being tough. It\u2019s a matter of being strong. It\u2019s a matter of being consistent. Our priorities ought to be first of all to meet our own military needs, secondly to meet the needs of our allies and friends, and only then should we ship military equipment to foreign countries. As a matter of fact, Iran is gonna get eighty F-14s before we even meet our own Air Force orders for F-l4s. And the shipment of Spruance-class destroyers to Iran are much more highly sophisticated than the Spruance-class destroyers that are present being delivered to our own Navy. This is ridiculous and it ought to be changed."}

So the Ford administration has done a good job in helping our good ally, Israel, and we\u2019re dedicated to the survival and security of Israel. I believe that Governor Carter doesn\u2019t realize the need and necessity for arms sales to Iran. He indicates he would not make those. Iran is bordered very extensively by the Soviet Union. Iran has Iraq as one of its neighbors. The Soviet Union and the Communist-dominated government of Iraq are neighbors of Iran, and Iran is an ally of the United States. It\u2019s my strong feeling that we ought to sell arms to Iran for its own national security, and as an ally \u2013 a strong ally of the United States. The history of our relationship with Iran goes back to the days of President Truman when he decided that it was vitally necessary for our own security as well as that of Iran, that we should help that country, and Iran has been a good ally. In 1973 when there was an oil embargo, Iran did not participate. Iran continued to sell oil to the United States. I believe that it\u2019s in our interest and in the interest of Israel and Iran, and Saudi Arabia, for the United States to sell arms to those countries.

These uh \u2013 characteristics of our country have been endangered under Mr. Ford. We\u2019re no longer respected in a showdown vote in the United Nations or in \u2013 in any other international council we\u2019re lucky to get 20 percent of the other nations to vote with us. Our allies feel that we\u2019ve neglected them. The so-called Nixon shock against Japan had weakened our relationships there. Under this administration we\u2019ve also had an inclination to keep separate the European countries, thinking that if they are separate, then we can dominate them and proceed with our secret, Lone Ranger-type diplomatic efforts. I would uh \u2013 also like to point out that we, in this country, have let our economy go down the drain. The worst inflation since the Great Depression. The highest unemployment of any developed nation of the world. We have a higher unemployment rate in this country than Great Britain, and West Germany. Our unemployment rate is twice as high as it is in Italy; it\u2019s three or four times as high as it is \u2013 as it is in Japan. And that terrible circumstance in this country is exported overseas. We comprise about 30 percent of the world\u2019s economic trade power influence. And when we\u2019re weak at home \u2013 weaker than all our allies \u2013 that weakness weakens the whole free world. So strong economy is very important. Another thing that we need to do is to reestablish the good relationships that we ought to have between the United States and our natural allies and friends. They have felt neglected. And using that base of strength, and using the idealism, the honesty, the predictability, the commitment, the integrity of our own country, that\u2019s where our strength lies. And that would permit us to deal with the developing nations in a position of strength. Under this administration we\u2019ve had a continuation of the so-called balance of power politics, where everything is looked on as a struggle between us on the one side, the Soviet Union on the other. Our allies \u2013 the smaller countries get trampled in the rush. What we need is to try to seek individualized bilateral relationships with countries, regardless of their size, and to establish world-order politics, which means that we want to preserve peace through strength. We also wanna revert back to the stature and the respect that our country had in previous administrations. Now, I can\u2019t say when this can come. But I can guarantee it will not come if Gerald Ford is reelected and this present policy is continued; it will come if I\u2019m elected."}

We\u2019ve seen, in this world, a development of a tremendous threat to us. As a nuclear engineer myself, I know the limitations and capabilities of atomic power. I also \u2013 know that as far as the human beings on this earth are concerned that the nonproliferation of atomic weapons is number one. Only the last few days with the election approaching, has Mr. Ford taken any interest in a nonproliferation movement. I advocated last May in a speech at the United Nations that we move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear devices, both weapons and peaceful devices; that we not ship any more atomic fuel to a country that refuses to comply with strict controls over the waste which can be reprocessed into explosives. I\u2019ve also advocated that we stop the sale by Germany and France of \u2013 processing plants for Pakistan and Brazil. Mr. Ford hasn\u2019t moved on this. We also need to provide an adequate supply of enriched uranium. Mr. Ford, again, under pressure from the atomic energy lobby, has insisted that this reprocessing or rather re-en- enrichment be done by private industry and not by the existing uh \u2013 government uh \u2013 plants. This kind of confusion and absence of leadership has let us drift now for two years with a constantly increasing threat of atomic weapons throughout the world. We now have five nations that have atomic bombs that we know about. If we continue under Mr. Ford\u2019s policy by 1985 or \u201990 we\u2019ll have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons. This has got to be stopped.

Mr. Ford\u2019s own uh \u2013 environmental agency has projected a 10 percent unemployment rate by 1978 if he\u2019s uh \u2013 president. The American people are ready to make sacrifices if they are part of the process. If they know that they will be helping to make decisions and won\u2019t be excluded from being an involved party to the national purpose. The major effort we must put forward is to put our people back to work. And I think that this uh \u2013 is one example where uh \u2013 a lot of people have selfish, grasping ideas now. I remember 1973 in the depth of the uh \u2013 energy crisis when President Nixon called on the American people to make a sacrifice, to cut down on the waste of uh \u2013 gasoline, to cut down on the uh \u2013 speed of automobiles. It was a \u2013 a tremendous surge of patriotism, that \u201cI want to make a sacrifice for my country.\u201d I think we uh \u2013 could call together, with strong leadership in the White House, business, industry and labor, and say let\u2019s have voluntary price restraints. Let\u2019s lay down some guidelines so we don\u2019t have continuing inflation. We can also have a- an end to the extremes. We now have one extreme for instance, of some welfare recipients, who by taking advantage of the welfare laws, the housing laws, the uh \u2013 Medicaid uh \u2013 laws, and the uh \u2013 food stamp laws, make over $10 thousand a year and uh \u2013 they don\u2019t have to pay any taxes on it. At the other extreme, uh \u2013 just 1 percent of the richest people in our country derive 25 percent of all the tax benefits. So both those extremes grasp for advantage and the person who has to pay that expense is the middle-income family who\u2019s still working for a living and they have to pay for the rich who have privilege, and for the poor who are not working. But I think uh \u2013 uh \u2013 a balanced approach, with everybody being part of it and a striving for unselfishness, could help as it did in 1973 to let people sacrifice for their own country. I know I\u2019m ready for it. I think the American people are too."}

And uh \u2013 the Playboy thing has been of great \u2013 very great concern to me. I don\u2019t know how to deal with it exactly. Uh \u2013 I uh \u2013 agreed to give the interview uh \u2013 to Playboy Other people have done it who are notable \u2013 uh \u2013 Governor Jerry Brown, uh \u2013 Walter Cronkite, uh \u2013 Albert Schweitzer, Mr. Ford\u2019s own secretary of the treasury, Mr. Simon, uh \u2013 William Buckley \u2013 many other people. But they weren\u2019t running for president, and in retrospect, from hindsight, I would not have given that uh \u2013 interview had I do it \u2013 had it \u2013 I to do it over again. If I should ever decide in the future to discuss my \u2013 my deep Christian beliefs and uh \u2013 condemnation and sinfulness, I\u2019ll use another forum besides Playboy. But I can say this, uh \u2013 I\u2019m doing the best I can to get away from that, and during the next ten days, the American people will not see the Carter campaign running uh \u2013 television advertisements and newspaper advertisements based on a personal attack on President Ford\u2019s character. I believe that the opposite is true with President Ford\u2019s campaign, and uh \u2013 I hope that we can leave those issues in this next ten days about personalities and mistakes of the past \u2013 we\u2019ve both made some mistakes \u2013 and talk about unemployment, inflation, housing, education, taxation, government organization, stripping away of secrecy, and the things that are crucial to the American people. I regret the things in my own long campaign that have been mistaken, but I\u2019m trying to do away with those the last ten days."}

I said I had no recollection whatsoever of talking with any of the White House legislative liaison people. I indicated under oath that the initiative that I took was at the request of the ranking members of the House Banking and Currency Committee on the Republican side, which was a legitimate request and a proper response by me. Now that was gone into by two congressional committees, and following that investigation, both committees overwhelmingly approved me, and the House and the Senate did likewise. Now, in the meantime, the special prosecutor, within the last few days, after an investigation himself, said there was no reason for him to get involved because he found nothing that would justify it. And then just a day or two ago, the attorney general of the United States made a further investigation and came to precisely the same conclusion. Now, after all of those investigations by objective, responsible people, I think the matter is closed once and for all. But to add one other feature, I don\u2019t control any of the tapes.

I came from a tiny town, as you know, Plains, and didn\u2019t hold public office, didn\u2019t have very much money. And my first organization was just four or five people plus my wife and my children, my three sons and their wives. And we won the nomination by going out into the streets \u2013 barbershops, beauty parlors, restaurants, stores, in factory shift lines also in farmers\u2019 markets and livestock sale barns \u2013 and we talked a lot and we listened a lot and we learned from the American people.

Now we have a very, very wide-ranging group of advisers who help me prepare for these debates and who teach me about international economics, and foreign affairs, defense matters, health, education, welfare, government reorganization. I\u2019d say, several hundred of them. And they\u2019re very fine and very highly qualified. The one major decision that I have made since acquiring the nomination, and I share this with President Ford, is the choice of a vice president. I think this should be indicative of the kind of leaders I would choose to help me if I am elected. I chose Senator Walter Mondale. And the only criterion I ever put forward in my own mind was who among the several million people in this country would be the best person qualified to be president, if something should happen to me and to join me in being vice president if I should serve out my term. And I\u2019m convinced now, more than I was when I got the nomination, that Walter Mondale was the right choice, And I believe this is a good indication of the kind of people I would choose in the future. Mr. Ford has had that same choice to make. I don\u2019t want to say anything critical of Senator Dole, but I\u2019ve never heard Mr. Ford say that that was his prim- primary consideration \u2013 Who is the best person I could choose in this country to be president of the United States? I feel completely at ease knowing that someday Senator Mondale might very well be president. In the last five pres- vice presidential uh \u2013 nominees, uh \u2013 incumbents, three of them have become president. But I think this is indicative of what I would do."}

I vetoed the strip-mining bill, Mr. Kraft, because it was the overwhelming consensus of knowledgeable people that that strip-mining bill would have meant the loss of literally uh \u2013 thousands of jobs, something around a hundred and forty thousand jabs. Number two, that strip-mining bill would\u2019ve severely set back our need for more coal, and Governor Carter has said repeatedly that coal is the resource that we need to use more in the effort to become independent of the uh \u2013 Arab oil supply. So, I vetoed it because of a loss of jobs and because it would\u2019ve interfered with our energy independence program. The auto emissions \u2013 uh \u2013 it was agreed by Leonard Woodcock, the head of the UAW, and by the uh \u2013 heads of all of the automobile industry, we had labor and management together saying that those auto emission standards had to be modified. But let\u2019s talk about what the Ford administration has done in the field of environment. I have increased, as president, by over 60 percent the funding for water treatment plants in the United States, the federal contribution. I have fully funded the land and water conservation program; in fact, have recommended and the Congress approved a substantially increased land and water conservation program. Uh \u2013 I have uh \u2013 added in the current year budget the funds for the National Park Service. For example, we uh \u2013 proposed about $12 million to add between four and five hundred more employees for the National Park Service. And a month or so ago I did uh \u2013 likewise say over the next ten years we should expand \u2013 double \u2013 this national parks, the wild wilderness areas, the scenic river areas.

This uh \u2013 administration\u2019s record on environment is very bad. Uh \u2013 I think it\u2019s accurate to say that the uh \u2013 strip-mining law which was passed twice by the Congress \u2013 uh \u2013 and was only like two votes I believe of being overridden \u2013 would have been good for the country. The claim that it would have put hundred and forty thousand miners out of work is uh \u2013 hard to believe, when at the time Mr. Ford vetoed it, the United Mine Workers was uh \u2013 supporting the bill. And I don\u2019t think they would have supported the uh \u2013 bill had they known that they would lose a hundred and forty thousand jobs. There\u2019s been a consistent policy on the part of this administration to lower or delay enforcement of air pollution standards and water pollution standards. And under both President Nixon and Ford, monies have been impounded that would\u2019ve gone to uh \u2013 cities and others to control uh \u2013 water pollution. We have no energy policy. We, I think, are the only developed nation in the world that has no comprehensive energy policy, to permit us to plan in an orderly way how to shift from increasing the scarce uh \u2013 energy uh \u2013 forms: oil, and have research and development concentrated on the increased use of coal, which I strongly favor. The research and development to be used primary to make the coal burning uh \u2013 be clean. We need a heritage trust program, similar to the one we had in Georgia, to set aside additional lands that have uh \u2013 geological and archeological importance, uh natural areas for enjoyment. Uh \u2013 the lands that Mr. Ford uh \u2013 brags about having approved are in Alaska and they are enormous in uh \u2013 in size. But as far as the accessibility of them by the American people, it\u2019s very uh \u2013 far in the future. We\u2019ve taken no strong position in the uh \u2013 control of pollution of our oceans, and I would say the worst uh \u2013 threat to the environment of all is nuclear proliferation. And this administration, having been in office now for two years or more, has still not taken strong and bold action to stop the proliferation of nuclear waste around the world, particularly plutonium. Those are some brief remarks about the failures of this administration. I would do the opposite in every respect."}

In the first place, uh \u2013 as is the case with the environmental policy and the energy policy that I just described, and the policy for nonproliferation of uh \u2013 of nuclear waste, this administration has no urban policy. It\u2019s impossible for mayors or governors to cooperate with the resident, because they can\u2019t anticipate what\u2019s gonna happen next. A mayor of a city like New York, for instance, needs to know uh \u2013 eighteen months or two years ahead of time what responsibility the city will have in administration and in financing \u2013 in things like housing, uh \u2013 pollution control, uh \u2013 crime control, education, welfare and health. This has not been done, unfortunately. I remember the headline in the Daily News that said, \u201cFord to New York: Drop Dead.\u201d I think it\u2019s very important that our cities know that they have a partner in the federal government. Quite often Congress has passed laws in the past designed to help people with uh \u2013 the ownership of homes and with the control of crime and with adequate health care and education programs and so forth. Uh \u2013 those uh programs were designed to help those who need it most. And quite often this has been in the very poor people and neighborhoods in the downtown urban centers. Because of the uh \u2013 great -ly- greatly uh \u2013 advantaged uh \u2013 tho- per \u2013 persons who live in the suburbs, better education, better organization, more articulate, more aware of what the laws are, quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where it\u2019s needed. Also I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care. We have now uh \u2013 for instance only 7 percent of the total education cost being financed by the federal government. When uh \u2013 the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent. That\u2019s a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contributes to education in just eight years. And as you know, the education cost has gone up uh \u2013 tremendously. The last point is that the major \u2013 uh thrust has gotta be to put people back to work. We\u2019ve got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh \u2013 particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent. And the concentration of employment opportunities in those areas would help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base, but also to help reduce the extraordinary welfare cost. One of the major responsibilities on the shoulders of uh \u2013 New York City is to \u2013 is to finance welfare. And I favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether. And over a longer period of time, let the federal government begin to absorb part of it that\u2019s now paid by the state governments. Those things would help a great deal with the cities, but we still have a \u2013 a very serious problem there."}

The Ford administration does have a very comprehensive program to help uh \u2013 our major metropolitan areas. I fought for, and the Congress finally went along with a general revenue sharing program, whereby cities and uh \u2013 states, uh \u2013 the cities two-thirds and the states one-third, get over six billion dollars a year in cash through which they can uh \u2013 provide many, many services, whatever they really want. In addition we uh \u2013 in the federal government make available to uh \u2013 cities about uh \u2013 three billion three hundred million dollars in what we call community development. In adesh- in addition, uh \u2013 uh \u2013 as a result of my pressure an the Congress, we got a major mass transit program uh \u2013 over a four-year period, eleven billion eight-hundred million dollars. We have a good housing program, uh \u2013 that uh \u2013 will result in cutting uh \u2013 the down payments by 50 percent and uh \u2013 having mortgage payments uh lower at the beginning of any mortgage period. We\u2019re expanding our homestead uh \u2013 housing program. The net result is uh \u2013 we think under Carla Hills, who\u2019s the chairman of my uh \u2013 urban development and uh \u2013 neighborhood revitalization program, we will really do a first-class job in helping uh \u2013 the communities throughout the country. As a matter of fact, that committee under Secretary Hills released about a seventy-five-page report with specific recommendations so we can do a better job uh \u2013 the weeks ahead. And in addition, the tax program of the Ford administration, which provides an incentive for industry to move into our major uh \u2013 metropolitan areas, into the inner cities, will bring jobs where people are, and help to revitalize those cities as they can be."}

You\u2019re familiar, I\u2019m sure, with the recognition given in the Air Force to uh \u2013 General James, and there was just uh \u2013 approved a three-star admiral, the first in the history of the United States Navy, so uh \u2013 we are giving full recognition to individuals of quality in the Ford administration in positions of great responsibility.

Uh \u2013 the Department of uh \u2013 uh \u2013 HUD is enforcing the new legislation that uhh \u2013 outlaws, that takes care of redlining. Uh \u2013 what we\u2019re doing is saying that there are opportunities, business opportunities, educational opportunities, responsibilities uh \u2013 where people with talent, black or any other minority, can fully qualify. The Office of Minority Business in the Department of Commerce has made available more money in trying to help uh \u2013 black businessmen or other minority businessmen than any other administration since the office was established. The Office of Small Business, under Mr. Kobelinski, has a very massive program trying to help the black community. The individual who wants to start a business or expand his business as a black businessman is able to borrow, either directly or with guaranteed loans. I believe on the record that this administration has been more responsive and we have carried out the law to the letter, and I\u2019m proud of the record."}

I think it\u2019s accurate to say that Mr. Ford voted against the uh \u2013 Voting Rights Acts and the uh \u2013 Civil Rights Acts in their uh \u2013 debative stage I think once it was assured they were going to pass he finally voted for it. This country uh \u2013 changed drastically in 1969 when the uh \u2013 terms of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were over and Richard Nixon and \u2013 and Gerald Ford became the presidents. There was a time when there was hope for those who uh \u2013 were poor and downtrodden and who were \u2013 uh elderly or who were \u2013 uh ill or who were in minority groups, but that time has been gone. I think the greatest thing that ever happened to the South was the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the opening up of opportunities \u2013 uh to black people \u2013 the chance to vote, to hold a job, to buy a house, to go to school, and to participate in public affairs. It not only liberated \u2013 uh black people but it also liberated the whites. We\u2019ve seen uh \u2013 in many instances in recent years a minority affairs uh \u2013 section of uh Small Loan Administration, uh \u2013 Small Business Administration lend uh \u2013 a black entrepreneur just enough money to get started, and then to go bankrupt. The bankruptcies have gone up \u2013 uh in an extraordinary degree. Uh \u2013 FHA, which used to be a very responsible agency, uh \u2013 that everyone looked to to help own a home, lost six million dollars last year. There\u2019ve been over thirteen hundred indictments in HUD, over eight hundred convictions relating just to home loans. And now the federal government has become the world\u2019s greatest slum landlord. We\u2019ve got a 30 percent or 40 percent unemployment rate among minority uh \u2013 young people. And there\u2019s been no concerted effort given to the needs of those who are both poor and black, or poor and who speak a foreign language. And that\u2019s where there\u2019s been a great uh generation of despair, and ill health, and the lack of education, lack of purposefulness, and the lack of hope for the future. But it doesn\u2019t take just a quiet uh \u2013 dormant uh minimum enforcement of the law. It requires an aggressive searching out and reaching out to help people who especially need it. And that\u2019s been lacking in the last eight years."}

I think abortion\u2019s wrong. I don\u2019t think the government oughta do anything to encourage abortion. But I don\u2019t favor a constitutional amendment on the subject.

I personally don\u2019t believe that the federal government oughta finance abortions, but I \u2013 I draw the line and don\u2019t support a constitutional amendment. However, I honor the right of people who seek the constitutional amendments on school busing, on uh \u2013 prayer in the schools and an abortion. But among those you named, I won\u2019t actively work for the passage of any of them."}

The record just doesn\u2019t prove that such legislation or action by a local city council is effective. What we have to do, and this is the crux of the matter, is to make it very, very uh \u2013 difficult for a person who uses a gun in the commission of a crime to stay out of jail. If we make the use of a gun in the commission. of a crime a serious criminal offense, and that person is prosecuted, then, in my opinion, we are going after the person who uses the gun for the wrong reason. I don\u2019t believe in the registration of handguns or the registration of the handgun owner. That has not proven to be effective, and therefore, I think the better way is to go after the criminal, the individual who commits a crime in the possession of a gun and uses that gun for a part of his criminal activity. Those are the people who ought to be in jail. And the only way to do it is to pass strong legislation so that once apprehended, indicted, convicted, they\u2019ll be in jail and off the streets and not using guns in the commission of a crime."}

We uh \u2013 streamlined the structure of the court, put in administrative officers, put a unified court system in, required that all uh \u2013 severe sentences be reviewed far uniformity. And, in addition to that put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office of selection of \u2013 for all judges and district attorneys or prosecuting attorneys, on the basis of merit. Every time I had a vacancy on the Georgia Supreme Court \u2013 and I filled five of those vacancies out of seven total and about half the court of appeals judges, about 35 percent of the trial judges \u2013 I was given from an objective panel the five most highly qualified persons in Georgia. And from those five, I always chose the first one or second one. So merit selection of judges is the most important single criterion. And I would institute the same kind of procedure as president, not only in judicial appointments, but also in diplomatic appointments. Secondly, I think that the Burger Court has fairly well confirmed the major and \u2013 and most far-reaching and most controversial decisions of the Warren Court. Civil rights \u2013 uh has been confirmed by the Burger Court, hasn\u2019t been uh \u2013 reversed, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any inclination to reverse those basic decisions.

Uh \u2013 just a moment ago, for example, uh \u2013 he uh \u2013 was indicating that uh \u2013 uh \u2013 in the 1950s, for example, uh \u2013 unemployment was very low. He fails to point out that uh \u2013 in the 1950s we were engaged in the war in Vietnam. We \u2013 I mean in Korea \u2013 we had uh \u2013 three million five hundred thousand young men uh \u2013 in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines. That\u2019s not the way to end unemployment or to reduce unemployment. At the present time we\u2019re at peace. We have reduced the number of people in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines from three million, one hundred \u2013 three million, five hundred thousand to two mil- lion one hundred thousand. We are not at war. We have reduced the military manpower by a million four hundred thousand. If we had that many more people in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and Marines, our unemployment figure would be considerably less. But this administration doesn\u2019t believe the way to reduce unemployment is to go to war, or to increase the number of people in the military. So you cannot compare unemployment, as you sought to, uh \u2013 with the present time with the 1950s, because the then administration had people in the military \u2013 they were at war, they were fighting overseas, and this administration has reduced the size of the military by a million four hundred thousand.

I became president at the time that the United States was in a very troubled time.

SMITH","Speaker":"SENATOR KENNEDY","Party":"Democratic","Factor 1":18,"Factor 2":80,"Factor 3":-13,"Factor 4":4,"Factor 5":3,"Factor 6":6,"Text":"Mr. Smith, Mr. Nixon. In the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln said the question was whether this nation could exist half-slave or half-free. In the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half-slave or half-free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, in the direction of the road that we are taking, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery. I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain. We discuss tonight domestic issues, but I would not want that to be any implication to be given that this does not involve directly our struggle with Mr. Khrushchev for survival. Mr. Khrushchev is in New York, and he maintains the Communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the Soviet Union itself. The Chinese Communists have always had a large population. But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country. The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom. If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if we\u2019re moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world. If we fail, then freedom fails. Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do? Are we as strong as we should be? Are we as strong as we must be if we\u2019re going to maintain our independence, and if we\u2019re going to maintain and hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to us for assistance, to those who look to us for survival? I should make it very clear that I do not think we\u2019re doing enough, that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we\u2019re making. This is a great country, but I think it could be a greater country; and this is a powerful country, but I think it could be a more powerful country. I\u2019m not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel-mill capacity unused. I\u2019m not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world. Because economic growth means strength and vitality; it means we\u2019re able to sustain our defenses; it means we\u2019re able to meet our commitments abroad. I\u2019m not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food \u2013 some of it rotting \u2013 even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual. I saw cases in West Virginia, here in the United States, where children took home part of their school lunch in order to feed their families because I don\u2019t think we\u2019re meeting our obligations toward these Americans. I\u2019m not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are. I\u2019m not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part-time shifts. I think we should have an educational system second to none. I\u2019m not satisfied when I see men like Jimmy Hoffa \u2013 in charge of the largest union in the United States \u2013 still free. I\u2019m not satisfied when we are failing to develop the natural resources of the United States to the fullest. Here in the United States, which developed the Tennessee Valley and which built the Grand Coulee and the other dams in the Northwest United States at the present rate of hydropower production \u2013 and that is the hallmark of an industrialized society \u2013 the Soviet Union by 1975 will be producing more power than we are. These are all the things, I think, in this country that can make our society strong, or can mean that it stands still. I\u2019m not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights. If a Negro baby is born \u2013 and this is true also of Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in some of our cities \u2013 he has about one-half as much chance to get through high school as a white baby. He has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student. He has about a third as much chance to be a professional man, about half as much chance to own a house. He has about uh \u2013 four times as much chance that he\u2019ll be out of work in his life as the white baby. I think we can do better. I don\u2019t want the talents of any American to go to waste. I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government. I don\u2019t at all. I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities. And I want the states to meet their responsibilities. But I think there is also a national responsibility. The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty-five years. The people of the United States individually could not have developed the Tennessee Valley; collectively they could have. A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so. Seventeen million Americans, who live over sixty-five on an average Social Security check of about seventy-eight dollars a month, they\u2019re not able to sustain themselves individually, but they can sustain themselves through the social security system. I don\u2019t believe in big government, but I believe in effective governmental action. And I think that\u2019s the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom. It\u2019s the only way that we\u2019re going to move ahead. I think we can do a better job. I think we\u2019re going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us. We cannot turn the job over to anyone else. If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails. And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country. The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States. Because they felt that the American society was moving again. I want us to recapture that image. I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how we\u2019re doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese Communists. That is the obligation upon our generation. In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt said in his inaugural that this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny. I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous. The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack \u2013 attack it has ever known? I think it can be. And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here. I think it\u2019s time America started moving again."}

SMITH","Speaker":"MR. NIXON","Party":"Republican","Factor 1":52,"Factor 2":54,"Factor 3":-6,"Factor 4":3,"Factor 5":2,"Factor 6":4,"Text":"Mr. Smith, Senator Kennedy. The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with. There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position. There is no question but that this nation cannot stand still; because we are in a deadly competition, a competition not only with the men in the Kremlin, but the men in Peking. We\u2019re ahead in this competition, as Senator Kennedy, I think, has implied. But when you\u2019re in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead. And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the United States should move ahead. Where, then, do we disagree? I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still. We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world. Now last year, of course, was 1958. That happened to be a recession year. But when we look at the growth of G.N.P. this year, a year of recovery, we find that it\u2019s six and nine-tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today. More about that later. Looking then to this problem of how the United States should move ahead and where the United States is moving, I think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner: Let\u2019s look at the record. Is the United States standing still? Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation? Is it true that, as far as this country is concerned, in the field of electric power, in all of the fields that he has mentioned, we have not been moving ahead. Well, we have a comparison that we can make. We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration. When we compare these two records in the areas that Senator Kennedy has \u2013 has discussed tonight, I think we find that America has been moving ahead. Let\u2019s take schools. We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years. Let\u2019s take hydroelectric power. We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history. Let us take hospitals. We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration. The same is true of highways. Let\u2019s put it in terms that all of us can understand. We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven years. That shows that there\u2019s been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor. But let\u2019s not put it there; let\u2019s put it in terms of the average family. What has happened to you? We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration. What about the prices you pay? We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration. What\u2019s the net result of this? This means that the average family income went up fifteen per cent in the Eisenhower years as against two per cent in the Truman years. Now, this is not standing still. But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isn\u2019t enough. A record is never something to stand on. It\u2019s something to build on. And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress. And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way. Senator Kennedy has suggested that he believes he knows the way. I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion. But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new. They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it. And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then. What kind of programs are we for? We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people. We are for programs, in addition, which will see that our medical care for the aged are \u2013 is \u2013 are much \u2013 is much better handled than it is at the present time. Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims. We both want to help the old people. We want to see that they do have adequate medical care. The question is the means. I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates. I could give better examples, but for \u2013 for whatever it is, whether it\u2019s in the field of housing, or health, or medical care, or schools, or the eh- development of electric power, we have programs which we believe will move America, move her forward and build on the wonderful record that we have made over these past seven and a half years. Now, when we look at these programs, might I suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much you\u2019re spending. I will concede that in all the areas to which I have referred Senator Kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than I would have it spend. I costed out the cost of the Democratic platform. It runs a minimum of thirteen and two-tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than we\u2019re presently spending. Now the Republican platform will cost more too. It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than we\u2019re presently spending. Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours? Not at all. Because it isn\u2019t a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn\u2019t a question of which government does the most. It is a question of which administration does the right thing. And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans. I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress. The final point that I would like to make is this: Senator Kennedy has suggested in his speeches that we lack compassion for the poor, for the old, and for others that are unfortunate. Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere. I know what it means to be poor. I know what it means to see people who are unemployed. I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals."}

Mr. Nixon comes out of the Republican party. He was nominated by it.

I prefer to take the overall percentage record of the last twenty years of the Democrats and the eight years of the Republicans to show an overall period of growth. In regard to uh \u2013 price stability uh \u2013 I\u2019m not aware that that committee did produce recommendations that ever were certainly before the Congress from the point of view of legislation in regard to controlling prices.

We did come forward with a program of students for the Congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of Africa the previous year, so that I don\u2019t think that uh \u2013 we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor."}

The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall. There are hundreds of thousands of them. They really don\u2019t \u2013 they\u2019re not able to control their market very well. They bring their crops in or their livestock in, many of them about the same time. They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs \u2013 a few large companies in many cases \u2013 and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place. I think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture. And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse. The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States. The automobile industry is the number one market for steel. So if the farmers\u2019 economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country. So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one. Secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance. The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh \u2013 surpluses \u2013 nine billion dollars worth. We\u2019ve had a uh \u2013 higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years. I think that this farm policy has failed. In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance. And that can only be done through governmental action. I therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported, that the federal government, after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity, attempt to bring supply and demand into balance \u2013 attempt effective production controls \u2013 so that we won\u2019t have that five or six per cent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent. I think Mr. Benson\u2019s program has failed. And I must say, after reading the Vice President\u2019s speech before the farmers, as he read mine, I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s very much different from Mr. Benson\u2019s. I don\u2019t think it provides effective governmental controls. I think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years, which was Mr. Benson\u2019s theory. I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future."}

The President has always maintained and very properly so that he is entitled to get what advice he wants from his cabinet and from his other advisers without disclosing that to anybody \u2013 including as a matter of fact the Congress. Now, I can only say this. Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council. I have been in the cabinet. I have met with the legislative leaders. I have met with the President when he made the great decisions with regard to Lebanon, Quemoy and Matsu, other matters. The President has asked for my advice. I have given it. Sometimes my advice has been taken. Sometimes it has not. I do not say that I have made the decisions. And I would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decisions, The president only makes the decisions. All that his advisers do is to give counsel when he asks for it. As far as what experience counts and whether that is experience that counts, that isn\u2019t for me to say. Uh \u2013 I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider; Senator Kennedy\u2019s is there for the people to consider. As he pointed out, we came to the Congress in the same year. His experience has been different from mine. Mine has been in the executive branch. His has been in the legislative branch. I would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and I think both he and I are going to abide by whatever the people decide."}

I think what Mr. Novins was referring to was not one of Senator Kennedy\u2019s speeches, but the Democratic platform, which did mention cutting the national debt. I think, too, that it should be pointed out that of course it is not possible, particularly under the proposals that Senator Kennedy has advocated, either to cut the national debt or to reduce taxes. As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes. As Senator Kennedy points out that as far as his one proposal is concerned \u2013 the one for medical care for the aged \u2013 that that would be financed out of Social Security. That, however, is raising taxes for those who pay Social Security. He points out that he would make pay-as-you-go be the basis for our natural resources development. Where our natural resources development \u2013 which I also support, incidentally, however \u2013 whenever you uh \u2013 uh \u2013 in \u2013 in \u2013 uh \u2013 appropriates money for one of these projects, you have to pay now and appropriate the money and the eh- while they eventually do pay out, it doesn\u2019t mean that you \u2013 the government doesn\u2019t have to put out the money this year. And so I would say that in all of these proposals Senator Kennedy has made, they will result in one of two things: either he has to raise taxes or he has to unbalance the budget. If he unbalances the budget, that means you have inflation, and that will be, of course, a very cruel blow to the very people \u2013 the older people \u2013 that we\u2019ve been talking about. As far as aid for school construction is concerned, I favor that, as Senator Kennedy did, in January of this year, when he said he favored that rather than aid to s- teacher salaries. I favor that because I believe that\u2019s the best way to aid our schools without running any risk whatever of the federal government telling our teachers what to teach."}

The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state. The state then could determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher salaries. On that question the Vice President and I disagreed. I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly, because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I disagreed, and his tie vote uh \u2013 defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal. I don\u2019t want the federal government paying teachers\u2019 salaries directly. But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers\u2019 salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee. And therefore I think that was a sound proposal and that is why I supported it and I regret that it did not pass. Secondly, there have been statements made that uh \u2013 the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget. That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars. That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record. My view is that you can do these programs \u2013 and they should be carefully drawn \u2013 within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead."}

The Soviet Union is making great gains. It isn\u2019t enough to compare what might have been done eight years ago, or ten years ago, or fifteen years ago, or twenty years ago. I want to compare what we\u2019re doing with what our adversaries are doing, so that by the year 1970 the United States is ahead in education, in health, in building, in homes, in economic strength.

I must say that forty-four percent and that Soviet country is causing us a good deal of trouble tonight. I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship. I don\u2019t want to see the day when it\u2019s sixty percent of ours, and seventy and seventy-five and eighty and ninety percent of ours, with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction. Secondly, the Vice President mentioned medical care for the aged. Our program was an amendment to the Kerr bill. The Kerr bill provided assistance to all those who were not on Social Security. I think it\u2019s a very clear contrast. In 1935, when the Social Security Act was written, ninety-four out of ninety-five Republicans voted against it. Mr. Landon ran in 1936 to repeal it. In August of 1960, when we tried to get it again, but this time for medical care, we received the support of one Republican in the Senate on this occasion. Thirdly, I think the question before the American people is: as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them, the goals are the same for all Americans. The means are at question. The means are at issue. If you feel that everything that is being done now is satisfactory, that the relative power and prestige and strength of the United States is increasing in relation to that of the Communists; that we\u2019ve b- gaining more security, that we are achieving everything as a nation that we should achieve, that we are achieving a better life for our citizens and greater strength, then I agree. I think you should vote for Mr. Nixon. But if you feel that we have to move again in the sixties, that the function of the president is to set before the people the unfinished business of our society as Franklin Roosevelt did in the thirties, the agenda for our people \u2013 what we must do as a society to meet our needs in this country and protect our security and help the cause of freedom. As I said at the beginning, the question before us all, that faces all Republicans and all Democrats, is: can freedom in the next generation conquer, or are the Communists going to be successful? That\u2019s the great issue. And if we meet our responsibilities I think freedom will conquer. If we fail, if we fail to move ahead, if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country, then I think that uh \u2013 the tide could begin to run against us. And I don\u2019t want historians, ten years from now, to say, these were the years when the tide ran out for the United States. I want them to say these were the years when the tide came in; these were the years when the United States started to move again. That\u2019s the question before the American people, and only you can decide what you want, what you want this country to be, what you want to do with the future. I think we\u2019re ready to move. And it is to that great task, if we\u2019re successful, that we will address ourselves."}

As I look at Cuba today, I believe that we are following the right course, a course which is difficult but a course which under the circumstance is the only proper one which will see that the Cuban people get a chance to realize their aspirations of progress through freedom and that they get that with our cooperation with the other organi- of the states in the Organization of American States. Now Senator Kennedy has made some very strong criticisms of my part \u2013 or alleged part \u2013 in what has happened in Cuba. He points to the fact that I visited Cuba while Mr. Batista was in power there. I can only point out that if we are going to judge the Administrations in terms of our attitude toward dictators, we\u2019re glad to have a comparison with the previous administration. There were eleven dictators in South America and in Central America when we came in, in 1953. Today there are only three left including the one in Cuba. We think that\u2019s pretty good progress. Senator Kennedy also indicated with regard to Cuba that he thought that I had made a mistake when I was in Cuba in not calling for free elections in that country. Now I\u2019m very surprised that Senator Kennedy, who is on the Foreign Relations Committee, would have made such a statement as this kind. As a matter of fact in his book, The Strategy for Peace, he took the right position. And that position is that the United States has a treaty \u2013 a treaty with all of the Organization of American States \u2013 which prohibits us from interfering in the internal affairs of any other state and prohibits them as well. For me to have made such a statement would been in direct uh \u2013 opposition to that treaty. Now with regard to Cuba, let me make one thing clear. There isn\u2019t any question but that we will defend our rights there. There isn\u2019t any question but that we will defend Guantanamo if it\u2019s attacked. There also isn\u2019t any question but that the free people of Cuba \u2013 the people who want to be free \u2013 are going to be supported and that they will attain their freedom. No, Cuba is not lost, and I don\u2019t think this kind of defeatist talk by Senator Kennedy helps the situation one bit."}

First of all, he\u2019s wrong in thinking th- er- even suggesting that Mr. Khrushchev might have continued the conference if we had expressed regrets. He knew these flights were going on long before and that wasn\u2019t the reason that he broke up the conference. Second, he\u2019s wrong in the analogies that he makes. The United States is a strong country. Whenever we do anything that\u2019s wrong, we can express regrets. But when the president of the United States is doing something that\u2019s right, something that is for the purpose of defending the security of this country against surprise attack, he can never express regrets or apologize to anybody, including Mr. Khrushchev. Now in that connection Senator Kennedy has criticized the President on the ground not only of not expressing regrets, but because he allowed this flight to take place while the summit conference \u2013 or immediately before the summit conference occurred. This seems to me is criticism that again is wrong on his part. We all remember Pearl Harbor. We lost three thousand American lives. We cannot afford an intelligence gap. And I just want to make my position absolutely clear with regard to getting intelligence information. I don\u2019t intend to see to it that the United States is ever in a position where, while we\u2019re negotiating with the Soviet Union, that we discontinue our intelligence effort. And I don\u2019t intend ever to express regrets to Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else if I\u2019m doing something that has the support of the Congress and that is right for the purpose of protecting the security of the United States."}

I think we have to make progress first in the field of employment. And there we would give statutory authority to the Committee on Government Contracts, which is an effective way of getting real progress made in this area, since about one out of every four jobs is held by and is allotted by people who have government contracts. Certainly I think all of us agree that when anybody has a government contract, certainly the money that is spent under that contract ought to be disbursed equally without regard to the race or creed or color of the individual who is to be employed. Second, in the field of schools, we believe that there should be provisions whereby the federal government would give assistance to those districts who do want to integrate their schools. That of course was rejected as was the government contracts provision by the special session of the Congress to \u2013 in which Mr. Kennedy was quite active. And then as far as other areas are concerned, I think that we have to look to presidential leadership. And when I speak of presidential leadership, I refer for example to our attitude on the sit-in strikes. Here we have a situation which causes all of us concern \u2013 causes us concern because of the denial of the rights of people to the equality which we think belongs to everybody. I have talked to Negro mothers. I\u2019ve heard them explain \u2013 try to explain \u2013 how they tell their children how they can go into a store and buy a loaf of bread but then can\u2019t go into that store and sit at the counter and get a Coca Cola. This is wrong, and we have to do something about it. So, under the circumstances, what do we do? Well what we do is what the Attorney-General of the United States did under the direction of the President: call in the owners of chain stores and get them to take action. Now there are other places where the executive can lead, but let me just sum up by saying this: why do I talk every time I\u2019m in the South on civil rights? Not because I am preaching to the people of the South because this isn\u2019t just a Southern problem; it\u2019s a Northern problem and a Western problem; it\u2019s a problem for all of us. I do it because it\u2019s the responsibility of leadership, I do it because we have to solve this problem together. I do it right at this time particularly because when we have Khrushchev in this country \u2013 a man who has enslaved millions, a man who has slaughtered thousands \u2013 we cannot continue to have a situation where he can point the finger at the United States of America and say that we are denying rights to our citizens. And so I say both the candidates and both the vice presidential candidates, I would hope as well \u2013 including Senator Johnson \u2013 should talk on this issue at every opportunity."}

And that will always be the case as long as the Communists are on the international scene, in the aggressive tac- uh \u2013 tendencies that they presently are following. Now as far as the present situation is concerned, I think it\u2019s time that we nail a few of these distortions about the United States that have been put out. First of all, we hear that our prestige is at an all-time low. Senator Kennedy has been hitting that point over and over again. I would suggest that after Premier Kush- Khrushchev\u2019s uh \u2013 performance in the United Nations, compared with President Eisenhower\u2019s eloquent speech, that at the present time Communist prestige in the world is at an all-time low and American prestige is at an all-time high. Now that, of course, is just one factor, but it\u2019s a significant one. When we look, for example, at the vote on the Congo. We were on one side; they were on the other side. What happened? There were seventy votes for our position and none for theirs. Look at the votes in the United Nations over the past seven and a half years. That\u2019s a test of prestige. Every time the United States has been an one side and they\u2019ve been on the other side, our position has been sustained. Now looking to what we ought to do in the future. In this cold war we have to recognize where it is being fought and then we have to develop programs to deal with it. It\u2019s being fought primarily in Asia, in Africa, and in Latin America. What do we need? What tools do we need to fight us? Well we need, for example, economic assistance; we need technical assistance; we need exchange; we need programs of diplomatic and other character which will be effective in that area. Now Senator Kennedy a moment ago referred to the fact that there was not an adequate Voice of America program for Latin America. I\u2019d like to point out that in the last six years, the Democratic Congresses, of which he\u2019d been a member, have cut twenty million dollars off of the Voice of America programs. They also have cut four billion dollars off of mutual security in these last six years. They also have cut two billion dollars off of defense. Now when they talk about our record here, it is well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well. So let me summarize by saying this: I\u2019m not satisfied with what we\u2019re doing in the cold war because I believe we have to step up our activities and launch an offensive for the minds and hearts and souls of men. It must be economic; it must be technological; above all it must be ideological. But we\u2019ve got to get help from the Congress in order to do this."}

We have been wholly indifferent to Latin America until the last few months. The program that was put forward this summer, after we broke off the sugar quota with Cuba, really was done because we wanted to get through the O.A.S. meeting a condemnation of Russian infiltration of Cuba. And therefore we passed an authorization \u2013 not an aid bill \u2013 which was the first time, really, since the Inter-American Bank which was founded a year ago was developed, that we really have looked at the needs of Latin America; that we have associated ourselves with those people. Secondly, I believe that in the ca- that it\u2019s far better for the United States, instead of concentrating our aid, particularly in the underdeveloped world, on surplus military equipment \u2013 we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into Laos. We paid more military aid, more aid into Laos po- per \u2013 per person than in any country in the world and we ought to know now that Laos is moving from neutralism in the direction of the Communists. I believe instead of doing that, we should concentrate our aid in long-term loans which these people can pay back either in hard money or in local currency. This permits them to maintain their self-respect. It permits us to make sure that the projects which are invested in are going to produce greater wealth. And I believe that in cases of India and Africa and Latin America that this is where our emphasis should be. I would strengthen the Development Loan Fund. And Senator Fulbright, Senator Humphrey and I tried to do that. We tried to provide an appropriation of a billion and a half for five years, on a long-term loan basis, which this Administration opposed. And unless we\u2019re ready to carry out programs like that in the sixties, this battle for economic survival which these people are waging are going to be lost. And if India should lose her battle, with thirty-five per cent of the people of the underdeveloped world within her borders, then I believe that the balance of power could move against us. I think the United States can afford to do these things. I think that we could not afford not to do these things. This goes to our survival. And here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if it\u2019s developing its economy to the fullest \u2013 which we are not now \u2013 in my judgment, we\u2019ll have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas. I believe it\u2019s essential that we do it because in the next ten years the balance of power is going to begin to move in the world from one direction or another \u2013 towards us or towards the Communists \u2013 and unless we begin to identify ourselves not only with the anti-Communist fight, but also with the fight against poverty and hunger, these people are going to begin to turn to the Communists as an example. I believe we can do it. If we build our economy the way we should, we can afford to do these things and we must do it."}

This we must get across to the world. And we can\u2019t do it unless we do have adequate funds for, for example, information which has been cut by the Congress, adequate funds for technical assistance. The other point that I would make with regard to economic assistance and technical assistance is that the United States must not rest its case here alone. This is primarily an ideological battle \u2013 a battle for the minds and the hearts and the souls of men. We must not meet the Communists purely in the field of gross atheistic materialism. We must stand for our ideals."}

Now in the last Congress \u2013 the special session of the Congress \u2013 there was a bill: one by the President, one by Senator Kennedy and members of his party. Now the bill that the President had submitted would have provided more aid for those areas that really need it \u2013 areas like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and the areas of West Virginia \u2013 than the ones that Senator Kennedy was supporting. On the other hand we found that the bill got into the legislative difficulties and consequently no action was taken. So point one, at the highest priority we must get a bill for depressed areas through the next Congress. I have made recommendations on that and I have discussed them previously and I will spell them out further in the campaign. Second, as we consider this problem of unemployment, we have to realize where it is. In analyzing the figures we will find that our unemployment exists among the older citizens; it exists also among those who are inadequately trained; that is, those who do not have an adequate opportunity for education. It also exists among minority groups. If we\u2019re going to combat unemployment, then, we have to do a better job in these areas. That\u2019s why I have a program for education, a program in the case of equal job opportunities, and one that would also deal with our older citizens. Now finally, with regard to the whole problem of combating recession, as you call it, we must use the full resources of the government in these respects: one, we must see to it that credit is expanded as we go into any recessionary period \u2013 and understand, I do not believe we\u2019re going into a recession. I believe this economy is sound and that we\u2019re going to move up. But second, in addition to that, if we do get into a recessionary period we should move on that part of the economy which is represented by the private sector, and I mean stimulate that part of the economy that can create jobs \u2013 the private sector of the economy. This means through tax reform and if necessary tax cuts that will stimulate more jobs. I favor that rather than massive federal spending programs which will come into effect usually long after you\u2019ve passed through the recessionary period. So we must use all of these weapons for the purpose of combating recession if it should come. But I do not expect it to come."}

In fact, it would be deflationary; it would cause great unemployment; it would cause a real slowdown in our economy. If it ever becomes necessary, and is wise economically and essential to our security, I would have no hesitancy in suggesting a tax increase or any other policy which would defend the United States. I have talked in every speech about the fact that these are going to be very difficult times in the nineteen-sixties and that we\u2019re going to have to meet our responsibilities as citizens. I\u2019m talking about a national mood. I\u2019m talking about our willingness to bear any burdens in order to maintain our own freedom and in order to meet our freedom around the globe. We don\u2019t know what the future\u2019s going to bring. But I would not want anyone to elect me uh \u2013 president of the United States \u2013 or vote for me \u2013 under the expectation that life would be easier if I were elected. Now, many of the programs that I\u2019m talking about \u2013 economic growth, care for the aged, development of our natural resources \u2013 build the strength of the United States. That\u2019s how the United States began to prepare for its great actions in World War II and in the post-war period. If we\u2019re moving ahead, if we\u2019re providing a viable economy, if our people have sufficient resources so that they can consume what we produce; then this country\u2019s on the move, then we\u2019re stronger, then we set a better example to the world. So we have the problem of not only building our own uh \u2013 military strength and extending uh \u2013 our policies abroad, we have to do a job here at home. So I believe that the policies that I recommend came under the general heading of strengthening the United States. We\u2019re using our steel capacity fifty-five per cent today. We\u2019re not able to consume what we\u2019re able to produce at a time when the Soviet Union is making great economic gains. And all I say is, I don\u2019t know what the sixties will bring \u2013 except I think they will bring hard times in the uh \u2013 international sphere; I hope we can move ahead here at home in the United States; I\u2019m confident we can do a far better job of mobilizing our economy and resources in the United States. And I merely say that they \u2013 if they elect me president, I will do my best to carry the United States through a difficult period; but I would not want people to elect me because I promised them the easy, soft life. I think it\u2019s going to be difficult; but I\u2019m confident that this country can meet its responsibilities."}

And as I pointed out in 1952, I made it very clear that as far as the Korean War was concerned, that I felt that the decision to go into the war in Korea was right and necessary. What I criticized were the policies that made it necessary to go to Korea. Now incidentally, I should point out here that Senator Kennedy has attacked our foreign policy. He\u2019s said that it\u2019s been a policy that has led to defeat and retreat. And I\u2019d like to know where have we been defeated and where have we retreated? In the Truman Administration, six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain including the satellite countries of Eastern Europe and Communist China. In this Administration we\u2019ve stopped them at Quemoy and Matsu; we\u2019ve stopped them in Indochina; we\u2019ve stopped them in Lebanon; we\u2019ve stopped them in other parts of the world. I would also like to point out that as far as Senator Kennedy\u2019s comments are concerned, I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks we\u2019re wrong. But he has a responsibility to be accurate, and not to misstate the case. I don\u2019t think he should say that our prestige is at an all-time low. I think this is very harmful at a time Mr. Khrushchev is here \u2013 harmful because it\u2019s wrong. I don\u2019t think it was helpful when he suggested \u2013 and I\u2019m glad he\u2019s corrected this to an extent \u2013 that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night in the United States. Now this just wasn\u2019t true. Now, there are people who go to bed hungry in the United States \u2013 far less, incidentally, than used to go to bed hungry when we came into power at the end of the Truman Administration. But the thing that is right about the United States, it should be emphasized, is that less people go to bed hungry in the United States than in any major country in the world. We\u2019re the best fed; we\u2019re the best clothed, with a better distribution of this world\u2019s goods to all of our people than any people in history. Now, in pointing out the things that are wrong, I think we ought to emphasize America\u2019s strengths. It isn\u2019t necessary to \u2013 to run America down in order to build her up. Now so that we get it absolutely clear: Senator Kennedy must as a candidate \u2013 as I as a candidate in fifty-two \u2013 criticize us when we\u2019re wrong. And he\u2019s doing a very effective job of that, in his way. But on the other hand, he has a responsibility to be accurate. And I have a responsibility to correct him every time he misstates the case; and I intend to continue to do so."}

I believe strongly in the defense of Formosa. These islands are a few miles \u2013 five or six miles \u2013 off the coast of Red China, within a general harbor area and more than a hundred miles from Formosa. We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it\u2019s attacked. We say we will defend it if it\u2019s part of a general attack on Formosa. But it\u2019s extremely difficult to make that judgment. Now, Mr. Herter in 1958, when he was Under Secretary of State, said they were strategically undefensible. Admirals Spruance and Callins in 1955 said that we should not attempt to defend these islands, in their conference in the Far East. General Ridgway has said the same thing. I believe that when you get into a w- if you\u2019re going to get into war for the defense of Formosa, it ought to be on a clearly defined line. One of the problems, I think, at the time of South Korea was the question of whether the United States would defend it if it were attacked. I believe that we should defend Formosa. We should come to its defense. To leave this rather in the air, that we will defend it under some conditions but not under other, I think is a mistake. Secondly, I would not suggest the withdrawal at the point of the Communist gun. It is a decision finally that the Nationalists should make and I believe that we should consult with them and attempt to work out a plan by which the line is drawn at the island of Formosa. It leaves a hundred miles between the sea. But with General Ridgway, Mr. Herter, General Collins, Admiral Spruance and many others, I think it\u2019s unwise to take the chance of being dragged into a war which may lead to a world war over two islands which are not strategically defensible, which are not, according to their testimony, essential to the defense of Formosa. I think that uh \u2013 we should protect our commitments. I believe strongly we should do so in Berlin. I believe strongly we should d- do so in Formosa and I believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security we\u2019ve guaranteed. But I do not believe that that line in case of war should be drawn on those islands but instead on the island of Formosa. And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa, it\u2019s been my judgment ever since 1954, at the time of the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Far East, that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself."}

I will say this: in the event that such an attack occurred and in the event the attack was a prelude to an attack on Formosa \u2013 which would be the indication today because the Chinese Communists say over and over again that their objective is not the offshore islands, that they consider them only steppingstones to taking Formosa \u2013 in the event that their attack then were a prelude to an attack on Formosa, there isn\u2019t any question but that the United States would then again, as in the case of Berlin, honor our treaty obligations and stand by our ally of Formosa. But to indicate in advance how we would respond, to indicate the nature of this response would be incorrect; it would certainly be inappropriate; it would not be in the best interests of the United States. I will only say this, however, in addition: to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested \u2013 to suggest that we will surrender these islands or force our Chinese Nationalist allies to surrender them in advance \u2013 is not something that would lead to peace; it is something that would lead, in my opinion, to war. This is the history of dealing with dictators. This is something that Senator Kennedy and all Americans must know. We tried this with Hitler. It didn\u2019t work. He wanted first uh \u2013 we know, Austria, and then he went on to the Sudetenland and then Danzig, and each time it was thought this is all that he wanted. Now what do the Chinese Communists want? They don\u2019t want just Quemoy and Matsu; they don\u2019t want just Formosa; they want the world. And the question is if you surrender or indicate in advance that you\u2019re not going to defend any part of the free world, and you figure that\u2019s going to satisfy them, it doesn\u2019t satisfy them. It only whets their appetite; and then the question comes, when do you stop them? I\u2019ve often heard President Eisenhower in discussing this question, make the statement that if we once start the process of indicating that this point or that point is not the place to stop those who threaten the peace and freedom of the world, where do we stop them? And I say that those of us who stand against surrender of territory \u2013 this or any others \u2013 in the face of blackmail, in the s- face of force by the Communists are standing for the course that will lead to peace."}

Now on the question of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, I must say that I feel that another effort should be made by a new Administration in January of 1961, to renew negotiations with the Soviet Union and see whether it\u2019s possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chances of contamination of the atmosphere, and also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity. There are indications, because of new inventions, that ten, fifteen, or twenty nations will have a nuclear capacity \u2013 including Red China \u2013 by the end of the presidential office in 1964. This is extremely serious. There have been many wars in the history of mankind. And to take a chance uh \u2013 now be \u2013 and not make every effort that we could make to provide for some control over these weapons, I think would be a great mistake. One of my disagreements with the present Administration has been that I don\u2019t feel a real effort has been made an this very sensitive subject, not only of nuclear controls, but also of general disarmament. Less than a hundred people have been working throughout the entire federal government on this subject, and I believe it\u2019s been reflected in our success and failures at Geneva. Now, we may not succeed. The Soviet Union may not agree to an inspection system. We may be able to get satisfactory assurances. It may be necessary for us to begin testing again. But I hope the next Administration \u2013 and if I have anything to do with it, the next Administration will \u2013 make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels. These must be done. If we cannot succeed, then we must strengthen ourselves. But I would make the effort because I think the fate not only of our own civilization, but I think the fate of world and the future of the human race is involved in preventing a nuclear war."}

Number two, on the question of the U-2 flights. I thought the. U-2 flight in May just before the conference was a mistake in timing because of the hazards involved, if the summit conference had any hope for success.

Uh \u2013 I will say simply, in advance of it, that I believe that in this area, the laws which should be passed uh \u2013 as far as the big national emergency strikes are concerned, are ones that will give the president more weapons with which to deal with those strikes. Now, I have a basic disagreement with Senator Kennedy, though, on this point. He has taken the position, when he first indicated in October of last year, that he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons the president might have to stop a national emergency strike. I understand in his last speech before the Steelworkers Union, that he changed that position and indicated that he felt that government seizure might be the best way to stop a strike which could not be settled by collective bargaining. I do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure. I think the moment that you give to the union, on the one side, and to management, on the other side, the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled, that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government, and that will be a \u2013 be in the end, in my opinion, wage control; it would mean price control \u2013 all the things that we do not want. I do believe, however, that we can give to the president of the United States powers, in addition to what he presently has in the fact finding area, which would enable him to be more effective than we have been in handling these strikes. One last point I should make. The record in handling them has been very good during this Administration. We have had less man-hours lost by strikes in these last seven years than we had in the previous seven years, by a great deal. And I only want to say that however good the record is, it\u2019s got to be better. Because in this critical year \u2013 period of the sixties we\u2019ve got to move forward, all Americans must move forward together, and we have to get the greatest cooperation possible between labor and management. We cannot afford stoppages of massive effect on the economy when we\u2019re in the terrible competition we\u2019re in with the Soviets."}

I never suggested that compulsory arbitration was the solution for national emergency disputes. I\u2019m opposed to that, was opposed to it in October, 1958. I have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act. I don\u2019t know what other weapons the Vice President is talking about. I\u2019m talking about giving him four or five tools \u2013 not only the fact-finding committee that he now has under the injunction provision, not only the injunction, but also the power of the fact-finding commission to make recommendations \u2013 recommendations which would not be binding, but nevertheless would have great force of public opinion behind them. One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure. There might be others. By the president having five powers \u2013 four or five powers \u2013 and he only has very limited powers today, neither the company nor the union would be sure which power would be used; and therefore, there would be a greater incentive on both sides to reach an agreement themselves without taking it to the government. The difficulty now is the president\u2019s course is quite limited. He can set up a fact-finding committee. The fact-finding committee\u2019s powers are limited. He can provide an injunction if there\u2019s a national emergency for eighty days, then the strike can go on; and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the Congress. This is a difficult and sensitive matter. But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do. He could leave the parties in doubt as to which one he would use; and therefore there would be incentive, instead of as now \u2013 the steel companies were ready to take the strike because they felt the injunction of eighty days would break the union, which didn\u2019t happen."}

The only two times when an unbalanced budget is warranted would be during a serious recession \u2013 and we had that in fifty-eight in an unbalanced budget of twelve billion dollars \u2013 or a national emergency where there should be large expenditures for national defense, which we had in World War II and uh \u2013 during part of the Korean War. On the question of the cost of our budget, I have stated that it\u2019s my best judgment that our agricultural program will cost a billion and a half, possibly two billion dollars less than the present agricultural program. My judgment is that the program the Vice President put forward, which is an extension of Mr. Benson\u2019s program, will cost a billion dollars more than the present program, which costs about six billion dollars a year, the most expensive in history. We\u2019ve spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before that. Secondly, I believe that the high interest-rate policy that this Administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt \u2013 merely funding the debt \u2013 which is a burden an the taxpayers. I would hope, under a different monetary policy, that it would be possible to reduce that interest-rate burden, at least a billion dollars. Third, I think it\u2019s possible to gain a seven hundred million to a billion dollars through tax changes which I believe would close up loof- loopholes on dividend withholding, on expense accounts. Fourthly, I have suggested that the medical care for the aged \u2013 and the bill which the Congress now has passed and the President signed if fully implemented would cost a billion dollars on the Treasury \u2013 out of Treasury funds and a billion dollars by the states \u2013 the proposal that I have put forward and which many of the members of my party support is for medical care financed under Social Security; which would be financed under the Social Security taxes; which is less than three cents a day per person for medical care, doctors\u2019 bills, nurses, hospitals, when they retire. It is actuarially sound. So in my judgment we would spend more money in this Administration on aid to education, we\u2019d spend more money on housing, we\u2019d spend more money and I hope more wisely on defense than this Administration has. But I believe that the next Administration should work for a balanced budget, and that would be my intention.

Well, all that I can suggest is that all the experts who have studied the program indicate that it is the most fantastic program, the worst program, insofar as its effect on the farmers, that the \u2013 America has ever had foisted upon it in an election year or any other time. And I would also point out that Senator Kennedy left out a part of the cost of that program \u2013 a twenty-five percent rise in food prices that the people would have to pay. Now are we going to have that when it isn\u2019t going to help the farmers? I don\u2019t think we should have that kind of a program. Then he goes on to say that he\u2019s going to change the interest-rate situation and we\u2019re going to get some more money that way. Well, what he is saying there in effect, we\u2019re going to have inflation. We\u2019re going to go right back to what we had under Mr. Truman when he had political control of the Federal Reserve Board. I don\u2019t believe we ought to pay our bills through inflation, through a phony interest rate."}

They\u2019re moving about eight or nine days in Texas. But I can assure you that if I\u2019m elected president, the whole spectrum of taxes will be gone through carefully. And if there is any inequities in oil or any other commodity, then I would vote to close that loophole, I have voted in the past to reduce the depletion allowance for the largest producers; for those from five million dollars down, to maintain it at twenty-seven and a half per cent. I believe we should study this and other allowances; tax expense, dividend expenses and all the rest, and make a determination of how we can stimulate growth; how we can provide the revenues needed to move our country forward."}

Because this is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to go out and explore for oil, to develop it. If we didn\u2019t have a depletion allowance of certainly, I believe, the present amount, we would have our oil exploration cut substantially in this country. Now, as far as my position then is concerned, it is exactly opposite to the Senator\u2019s. And it\u2019s because of my belief that if America is going to have the growth that he talks about and that I talk about and that we want, the thing to do is not to discourage individual enterprise, not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and minerals, but to encourage them. And so he would be doing exactly the wrong thing. One other thing. He suggests that there are a number of other items in this whole depletion field that could be taken into account. He also said a moment ago that we would get more money to finance his programs by revising the tax laws, including depletion. I should point out that as far as depletion allowances are concerned, the oil depletion allowance is one that provides eighty percent of all of those involved in depletion, so you\u2019re not going to get much from revenue insofar as depletion allowances are concerned, unless you move in the area that he indicated. But I oppose it. I oppose it for the reasons that I mentioned. I oppose it because I want us to have more oil exploration and not less."}

That means that we must continue to have a balanced budget here at home in every possible circumstance that we can; because the moment that we have loss of confidence in our own fiscal policies at home, it results in gold flowing out. Secondly, we have to increase our exports, as compared with our imports. And here we have a very strong program going forward in the Department of Commerce. This one must be stepped up. Beyond that, as far as the gold supply is concerned, and as far as the movement of gold is concerned, uh \u2013 we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom. Now America has been carrying a tremendous load in this respect. I think we have been right in carrying it. I have favored our programs abroad for economic assistance and for military assistance. But now we find that the countries of Europe for example, that we have aided, and Japan, that we\u2019ve aided in the Far East; these countries \u2013 some our former enemies, have now recovered completely. They have got to bear a greater share of this load of economic assistance abroad. That\u2019s why I am advocating, and will develop during the course of the next Administration \u2013 if, of course, I get the opportunity \u2013 a program in which we enlist more aid from these other countries on a concerted basis in the programs of economic development for Africa, Asia and Latin America. The United States cannot continue to carry the major share of this burden by itself. We can a big share of it, but we\u2019ve got to have more help from our friends abroad; and these three factors, I think, will be very helpful in reversing the gold flow which you spoke about."}

If his record is the opposite of that, that means that he doesn\u2019t want to go into it. Now on the question of gold. The difficulty, of course, is that we do have heavy obligations abroad, that we therefore have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of our dollars overseas to pay our troops, maintain our bases, and sustain other economies. In other words, if we\u2019re going to continue to maintain our position in the sixties, we have to maintain a sound monetary and fiscal policy. We have to have control over inflation, and we also have to have a favorable balance of trade. We have to be able to compete in the world market. We have to be able to sell abroad more than we consume uh \u2013 from abroad if we\u2019re going to be able to meet our obligations. In addition, many of the countries around the world still keep restrictions against our goads, going all the way back to the days when there was a dollar shortage.

I believe that we must be able to compete in the market \u2013 steel and in all the basic commodities abroad \u2013 we must be able to compete against them because we always did because of our technological lead. We have to be sure to maintain that. We have to persuade these other countries not to restrict our goods coming in, not to act as if there was a dollar gap; and third, we have to persuade them to assume some of the responsibilities that up till now we\u2019ve maintained, to assist underdeveloped countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia make an economic breakthrough on their own."}

Let\u2019s look at the situation with regard to economic growth as it really is. We find that the Soviet Union is a very primitive economy. Its growth rate is not what counts; it\u2019s whether it is catching up with us and it is not catching up with us. We\u2019re well ahead and we can stay ahead, provided we have confidence in America and don\u2019t run her down in order to build her up. We could look also at other items which Senator Kennedy has named, but I will only conclude by saying this: in this whole matter of prestige, in the final analysis, its whether you stand for what\u2019s right. And getting back to this matter that we discussed at the outset, the matter of Quemoy and Matsu. I can think of nothing that will be a greater blow to the prestige of the United States among the free nations in Asia than for us to take Senator Kennedy\u2019s advan- advice to go \u2013 go against what a majority of the members of the Senate, both Democrat and Republican, did \u2013 said in 1955, and to say in advance we will surrender an area to the Communists. In other words, if the United States is going to maintain its strength and its prestige, we must not only be strong militarily and economically, we must be firm diplomatically. Thi- Certainly we have been speaking, I know, of whether we should have retreat or defeat. Let\u2019s remember the way to win is not to retreat and not to surrender."}

NIXON","Party":"Republican","Factor 1":9,"Factor 2":88,"Factor 3":14,"Factor 4":-4,"Factor 5":-14,"Factor 6":4,"Text":"Mr. Howe, Senator Kennedy, my fellow Americans. Since this campaign began I have had a very rare privilege. I have traveled to forty-eight of the fifty states and in my travels I have learned what the people of the United States are thinking about. There is one issue that stands out above all the rest, one in which every American is concerned, regardless of what group he may be a member and regardless of where he may live. And that issue, very simply stated, is this: how can we keep the peace \u2013 keep it without surrender? How can we extend freedom \u2013 extend it without war? Now in determining how we deal with this issue, we must find the answer to a very important but simple question: who threatens the peace? Who threatens freedom in the world? There is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom \u2013 that that is presented by the international Communist movement. And therefore if we are to have peace, we must know how to deal with the Communists and their leaders. I know Mr. Khrushchev. I also have had the opportunity of knowing and meeting other Communist leaders in the world. I believe there are certain principles we must find in dealing with him and his colleagues \u2013 principles, if followed, that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom. First, we have to learn from the past, because we cannot afford to make the mistakes of the past. In the seven years before this Administration came into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain. And at the end of that seven years we were engaged in a war in Korea which cost of thirty thousand American lives. In the past seven years, in President Eisenhower\u2019s Administration, this situation has been reversed. We ended the Korean War; by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars; and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table. Now why were we successful, as our predecessors were not successful? I think there\u2019re several reasons. In the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the Communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world. One of the major errors they made was the one that led to the Korean War. In ruling out the defense of Korea, they invited aggression in that area. They thought they were going to have peace \u2013 it brought war. We learned from their mistakes. And so, in our seven years, we find that we have been firm in our diplomacy; we have never made concessions without getting concessions in return. We have always been willing to go the extra mile to negotiate for disarmament or in any other area. But we have never been willing to do anything that, in effect, surrendered freedom any place in the world. That is why President Eisenhower was correct in not apologizing or expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev at the Paris Conference, as Senator Kennedy suggested he could have done. That is why Senator wh- President Eisenhower was also correct in his policy in the Formosa Straits, where he declined, and refused to follow the recommendations \u2013 recommendations which Senator Kennedy voted for in 1955; again made in 1959; again repeated in his debates that you have heard \u2013 recommendations with regard to \u2013 again \u2013 slicing off a piece of free territory, and abandoning it, if \u2013 in effect, to the Communists. Why did the President feel this was wrong and why was the President right and his critics wrong? Because again this showed a lack of understanding of dictators, a lack of understanding particularly of Communists, because every time you make such a concession it does not lead to peace; it only encourages them to blackmail you. It encourages them to begin a war. And so I say that the record shows that we know how to keep the peace, to keep it without surrender. Let us move now to the future. It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical\u2026 leaders that the world has ever seen. That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area. First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have \u2013 if the should launch a surprise attack \u2013 we will be able to destroy their war-making capability. They must know, in other words, that it is national suicide if they begin anything. We need this kind of strength because we\u2019re the guardians of the peace. In addition to military strength, we need to see that the economy of this country continues to grow. It has grown in the past seven years. It can and will grow even more in the next four. And the reason that it must grow even more is because we have things to do at home and also because we\u2019re in a race for survival \u2013 a race in which it isn\u2019t enough to be ahead; it isn\u2019t enough simply to be complacent. We have to move ahead in order to stay ahead. And that is why, in this field, I have made recommendations which I am confident will move the American economy ahead \u2013 move it firmly and soundly so that there will never be a time when the Soviet Union will be able to challenge our superiority in this field. And so we need military strength, we need economic strength, we also need the right diplomatic policies. What are they? Again we turn to the past. Firmness but no belligerence, and by no belligerence I mean that we do not answer insult by insult. When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues. And that example that President Eisenhower has set we will continue to follow. But all this by itself is not enough. It is not enough for us simply to be the strongest nation militarily, the strongest economically, and also to have firm diplomacy. We must have a great goal. And that is: not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world, to extend it to all the world because that is America\u2019s destiny. To extend it to all the world because the Communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend Communism. And you cannot fight a victory for Communism or a strategy of victory for Communism with the strategy, simply of holding the line. And so I say that we believe that our policies of military strength, of economic strength, of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep it without surrender. We also believe that in the great field of ideals that we can lead America to the victory for freedom \u2013 victory in the newly developing countries, victory also in the captive countries \u2013 provided we have faith in ourselves and faith in our principles."}

KENNEDY","Party":"Democratic","Factor 1":19,"Factor 2":112,"Factor 3":3,"Factor 4":-20,"Factor 5":-1,"Factor 6":0,"Text":"Mr. Howe, Mr. Vice President. First uh \u2013 let me again try to correct the record on the matter of Quemoy and Matsu. I voted for the Formosa resolution in 1955. I have sustained it since then. I\u2019ve said that I agree with the Administration policy. Mr. Nixon earlier indicated that he would defend Quemoy and Matsu even if the attack on these islands, two miles off the coast of China, were not part of a general attack an Formosa and the Pescadores. I indicated that I would defend those islands if the attack were directed against Pescadores and Formosa, which is part of the Eisenhower policy. I\u2019ve supported that policy. In the last week, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have re-read the testimony of General Twining representing the Administration in 1959, and the Assistant Secretary of State before the Foreign Relations Committee in 1958, and I have accurately described the Administration policy, and I support it wholeheartedly. So that really isn\u2019t an issue in this campaign. It isn\u2019t an issue with Mr. Nixon, who now says that he also supports the Eisenhower policy. Nor is the question that all Americans want peace and security an issue in this campaign. The question is: are we moving in the direction of peace and security? Is our relative strength growing? Is, as Mr. Nixon says, our prestige at an all-time high, as he said a week ago, and that of the Communists at an all-time low? I don\u2019t believe it is. I don\u2019t believe that our relative strength is increasing. And I say that not as the Democratic standard-bearer, but as a citizen of the United States who is concerned about the United States. I look at Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States. In 1957 I was in Havana. I talked to the American Ambassador there. He said that he was the second most powerful man in Cuba. And yet even though Ambassador Smith and Ambassador Gardner, both Republican Ambassadors, both warned of Castro, the Marxist influences around Castro, the Communist influences around Castro, both of them have testified in the last six weeks, that in spite of their warnings to the American government, nothing was done. Our d- security depends upon Latin America. Can any American looking at the situation in Latin America feel contented with what\u2019s happening today, when a candidate for the presidency of Brazil feels it necessary to call \u2013 not on Washington during the campaign \u2013 but on Castro in Havana, in order to pick up the support of the Castro supporters in Brazil? At the American Conference \u2013 Inter-American Conference this summer, when we wanted them to join together in the denunciation of Castro and the Cuban Communists, we couldn\u2019t even get the Inter-American group to join together in denouncing Castro. It was rather a vague statement that they finally made. Do you know today that the Com- the Russians broadcast ten times as many programs in Spanish to Latin America as we do? Do you know we don\u2019t have a single program sponsored by our government to Cuba \u2013 to tell them our story, to tell them that we are their friends, that we want them to be free again? Africa is now the emerging area of the world. It contains twenty-five percent of all the members of the General Assembly. We didn\u2019t even have a Bureau of African Affairs until 1957. In the Africa south of the Sahara, which is the major new section, we have less students from all of Africa in that area studying under government auspices today than from the country of Thailand. If there\u2019s one thing Africa needs it\u2019s technical assistance. And yet last year we gave them less than five percent of all the technical assistance funds that we distributed around the world. We relied in the Middle East on the Baghdad Pact, and yet when the Iraqi Government was changed, the Baghdad Pact broke down. We relied on the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Middle East, which passed the Senate. There isn\u2019t one country in the Middle East that now endorses the Eisenhower Doctrine. We look to Europe uh \u2013 to Asia because the struggle is in the underdeveloped world. Which system, Communism or freedom, will triumph in the next five or ten years? That\u2019s what should concern us, not the history of ten, or fifteen, or twenty years ago. But are we doing enough in these areas? What are freedom\u2019s chances in those areas? By 1965 or 1970, will there be other Cubas in Latin America? Will Guinea and Ghana, which have now voted with the Communists frequently as newly independent countries of Africa \u2013 will there be others? Will the Congo go Communist? Will other countries? Are we doing enough in that area? And what about Asia? Is India going to win the economic struggle or is China going to win it? Who will dominate Asia in the next five or ten years? Communism? The Chinese? Or will freedom? The question which we have to decide as Americans \u2013 are we doing enough today? Is our strength and prestige rising? Do people want to be identified with us? Do they want to follow United States leadership? I don\u2019t think they do, enough. And that\u2019s what concerns me. In Africa \u2013 these countries that have newly joined the United Nations. On the question of admission of Red China, only two countries in all of Africa voted with us \u2013 Liberia and the Union of South Africa. The rest either abstained or voted against us. More countries in Asia voted against us on that question than voted with us. I believe that this struggle is going to go on, and it may be well decided in the next decade. I have seen Cuba go to the Communists. I have seen Communist influence and Castro influence rise in Latin America. I have seen us ignore Africa. There are six countries in Africa that are members of the United Nations. There isn\u2019t a single American diplomatic representative in any of those six. When Guinea became independent, the Soviet Ambassador showed up that very day. We didn\u2019t recognize them for two months; the American Ambassador didn\u2019t show up for nearly eight months. I believe that the world is changing fast. And I don\u2019t think this Administration has shown the foresight, has shown the knowledge, has been identified with the great fight which these people are waging to be free, to get a better standard of living, to live better. The average income in some of those countries is twenty-five dollars a year. The Communists say, \u201cCome with us; look what we\u2019ve done.\u201d And we\u2019ve been in \u2013 on the whole, uninterested. I think we\u2019re going to have to do better. Mr. Nixon talks about our being the strongest country in the world. I think we are today. But we were far stronger relative to the Communists five years ago, and what is of great concern is that the balance of power is in danger of moving with them. They made a breakthrough in missiles, and by nineteen sixty-one, two, and three, they will be outnumbering us in missiles. I\u2019m not as confident as he is that we will be the strongest military power by 1963. He talks about economic growth as a great indicator of freedom. I agree with him. What we do in this country, the kind of society that we build, that will tell whether freedom will be sustained around the world. And yet, in the last nine months of this year, we\u2019ve had a drop in our economic growth rather than a gain. We\u2019ve had the lowest rate of increase of economic growth in the last nine months of any major industrialized society in the world. I look up and see the Soviet flag on the moon. The fact is that the State Department polls on our prestige and influence around the world have shown such a sharp drop that up till now the State Department has been unwilling to release them. And yet they were polled by the U.S.I.A. The point of all this is, this is a struggle in which we\u2019re engaged. We want peace. We want freedom. We want security. We want to be stronger. We want freedom to gain. But I don\u2019t believe in these changing and revolutionary times this Administration has known that the world is changing \u2013 has identified itself with that change. I think the Communists have been moving with vigor \u2013 Laos, Africa, Cuba \u2013 all around the world today they\u2019re on the move. I think we have to revita1ize our society. I think we have to demonstrate to the people of the world that we\u2019re determined in this free country of ours to be first \u2013 not first if, and not first but, and not first when \u2013 but first. And when we are strong and when we are first, then freedom gains; then the prospects for peace increase; then the prospects for our society gain."}

I think that Senator Kennedy\u2019s policies and recommendations for the handling of the Castro regime are probably the most dangers- dangerously irresponsible recommendations that he\u2019s made during the course of this campaign. In effect, what Senator Kennedy recommends is that the United States government should give help to the exiles and to those within Cuba who oppose the Castro regime \u2013 provided they are anti-Batista. Now let\u2019s just see what this means. We have five treaties with Latin America, including the one setting up the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948, in which we have agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of any other American country \u2013 and they as well have agreed to do likewise. The charter of the United Nations \u2013 its Preamble, Article I and Article II \u2013 also provide that there shall be no intervention by one nation in the internal affairs of another. Now I don\u2019t know what Senator Kennedy suggests when he says that we should help those who oppose the Castro regime, both in Cuba and without. But I do know this: that if we were to follow that recommendation, that we would lose all of our friends in Latin America, we would probably be condemned in the United Nations, and we would not accomplish our objective. I know something else. It would be an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to come in, to come into Latin America and to engage us in what would be a civil war, and possibly even worse than that. This is the major recommendation that he\u2019s made. Now, what can we do? Well, we can do what we did with Guatemala. There was a Communist dictator that we inherited from the previous Administration. We quarantined Mr. Arbenz. The result was that the Guatemalan people themselves eventually rose up and they threw him out. We are quarantining Mr. Castro today. We\u2019re quarantining him diplomatically by bringing back our Ambassador; economically by cutting off trade, and Senator Kennedy\u2019s suggestion that the trade that we cut off is not significant is just one hundred percent wrong. We are cutting off the significant items that the Cuban regime needs in order to survive. By cutting off trade, by cutting off our diplomatic relations as we have, we will quarantine this regime so that the people of Cuba themselves will take care of Mr. Castro. But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want."}

Third, I would say this with regard to this report, with regard to Gallup Polls of prestige abroad and everything else that we\u2019ve been hearing about \u201cwhat about American prestige abroad\u201d: America\u2019s prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for America allow it to be. Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example \u2013 Senator Kennedy \u2013 stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight \u2013 we\u2019ve had twenty-eight successful shots, they\u2019ve had eight; when he states that we\u2019re second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I\u2019ve seen ours, and we\u2019re not; that we\u2019re second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we\u2019re way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige? Well, it can only have the effect certainly of reducing it. Well let me make one thing clear. Senator Kennedy has a responsibility to criticize those things that are wrong, but he has also a responsibility to be right in his criticism. Every one of these items that I have mentioned he\u2019s been wrong \u2013 dead wrong. And for that reason he has contributed to any lack of prestige. Finally, let me say this: as far as prestige is concerned, the first place it would show up would be in the United Nations. Now Senator Kennedy has referred to the vote on Communist China. Let\u2019s look at the vote on Hungary. There we got more votes for condemning Hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year. Let\u2019s look at the reaction eh \u2013 reaction to Khrushchev and Eisenhower at the last U.N. session. Did Khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted? Not at all. The President gained. America gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it\u2019s that that keeps the prestige of America up, not running down America the way Senator Kennedy has been running her down."}

I\u2019ve served this country for fourteen years in the Congress and before that in the service. I\u2019ve just as high a devotion, just as high an opinion. What I downgrade, Mr. Nixon, is the leadership the country is getting, not the country. Now I didn\u2019t make most of the statements that you said I made. The s- I believe the Soviet Union is first in outer space. We have \u2013 may have made more shots but the size of their rocket thrust and all the rest \u2013 you yourself said to Khrushchev, \u201cYou may be ahead of us in rocket thrust but we\u2019re ahead of you in color television\u201d in your famous discussion in the kitchen. I think that color television is not as important as rocket thrust. Secondly, I didn\u2019t say we had the worst slums in the world. I said we had too many slums. And that they are bad, and we ought to do something about them, and we ought to support housing legislation which this Administration has opposed. I didn\u2019t say we had the worst education in the world. What I said was that ten years ago, we were producing twice as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union and today they\u2019re producing twice as many as we are, and that this affects our security around the world. And fourth, I believe that the polls and other studies and votes in the United Nations and anyone reading the paper and any citizen of the United States must come to the conclusion that the United States no longer carries the same image of a vital society on the move with its brightest days ahead as it carried a decade or two decades ago. Part of that is because we\u2019ve stood still here at home, because we haven\u2019t met our problems in the United States, because we haven\u2019t had a moving economy. Part of that, as the Gallup Polls show, is because the Soviet Union made a breakthrough in outer space. Mr. George Allen, head of your Information Service, has said that that made the people of the world begin to wonder whether we were first in science. We\u2019re first in other areas of science but in space, which is the new science, we\u2019re not first."}

If we fail then, if we\u2019re unable to come to an agreement \u2013 and I hope we can come to an agreement because it does not merely involve now the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as atomic powers. Because new breakthroughs in atomic energy technology there\u2019s some indications that by the time the next president\u2019s term of office has come to an end, there may be ten, fifteen, or twenty countries with an atomic capacity, perhaps that many testing bombs with all the effect that it could have on the atmosphere and with all the chances that more and more countries will have an atomic capacity, with more and more chance of war. So one more effort should be made. I don\u2019t think that even if that effort fails that it will be necessary to carry on tests in the atmosphere which pollute the atmosphere. They can be carried out underground, they c- could be carried on in outer space. But I believe the effort should be made once more by who\u2019s ever elected president of the United States. If we fail, it\u2019s been a great serious failure for everyone \u2013 for the human race. I hope we can succeed. But then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then we\u2019ll have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the United States, and there may have to be testing underground. I think the Atomic Energy Committee is prepared for it. There may be testing in outer space. I hope it will not be necessary for any power to resume uh \u2013 testing in the atmosphere. It\u2019s possible to detect those kind of tests. The kind of tests which you can\u2019t detect are underground or in \u2013 in uh \u2013 perhaps in outer space. So that I\u2019m hopeful we can try once more. If we fail then we must meet our responsibilities to ourselves. But I\u2019m most concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapons. China may have it by 1963, Egypt. War has been the constant companion of mankind, so to have these weapons disseminated around the world, I believe means that we\u2019re going to move through a period of hazard in the next few years. We ought to make one last effort."}

I don\u2019t think we can wait until the next president is inaugurated and then uh \u2013 select a new team and then all the months of negotiating that will take place before we reach a decision, I think that immediately after this election we should set a timetable \u2013 the next president, working with the present President, President Eisenhower \u2013 a timetable to break the Soviet filibuster. There should be no tests in the atmosphere; that rules out any fall-out. But as far as underground tests for developing peaceful uses of atomic energy, we should not allow this Soviet filibuster to continue. I think it\u2019s time for them to fish or cut bait.

Uh \u2013 First of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference. This means at the secretary of state level and at the ambassadorial level. By adequate preparation I mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda, an agenda agreed upon with the approval of the heads of state involved. Now this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation. I don\u2019t believe we should go to a summit conference unless we have such an agenda, unless we have some reasonable insur- assurance from Mr. Khrushchev that he intends seriously to negotiate on those points. Now this may seem like a rigid, inflexible position. But let\u2019s look at the other side of the coin. If we build up the hopes of the world by having a summit conference that is not adequately prepared, and then, if Mr. Khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up \u2013 as he did this one \u2013 because he isn\u2019t going to get his way \u2013 we\u2019d set back the cause of peace. We do not help it. We can, in other words, negotiate many of these items of difference between us without going to the summit. I think we have to make a greater effort than we have been making at the secretary of state level, at the ambassadorial level, to work out the differences that we have. And so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit \u2013 a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it is. When I say \u201cphony spirit,\u201d I mean phony, not because the spirit is not good on our side, but because the Soviet Union simply doesn\u2019t intend to carry out what they say. Now, these are the conditions that I can lay out. I cannot be more precise than that, because until we see what Mr. Khrushchev does and what he says uh \u2013 we cannot indicate what our plans will be."}

KENNEDY","Party":"Democratic","Factor 1":0,"Factor 2":28,"Factor 3":6,"Factor 4":0,"Factor 5":-1,"Factor 6":1,"Text":"Well, I think the president of the United States last winter indicated that before he\u2019d go to the summit in May he did last fall, he indicated that there should be some agenda, that there should be some prior agreement. He hoped that there would be uh \u2013 b- be an agreement in part in disarmament. He also expressed the hope that there should be some understanding of the general situation in Berlin. The Soviet Union refused to agree to that, and we went to the summit and it was disastrous. I believe we should not go to the summit until there is some reason to believe that a meeting of minds can be obtained on either Berlin, outer space, or general disarmament \u2013 including nuclear testing. In addition, I believe the next president in January and February should go to work in building the strength of the United States. The Soviet Union does understand strength. We arm to parley, Winston Churchill said ten years ago. If we are strong, particularly as we face a crisis over Berlin \u2013 which we may in the spring, or in the winter \u2013 it\u2019s important that we maintain our determination here; that we indicate that we\u2019re building our strength; that we are determined to protect our position; that we\u2019re determined to protect our commitment. And then I believe we should indicate our desire to live at peace with the world. But until we\u2019re strong here, until we\u2019re moving here, I believe a summit could not be successful. I hope that before we do meet, there will be preliminary agreements on those four questions, or at least two of them, or even one of them, which would warrant such a meeting. I think if we had stuck by that position last winter, we would have been in a better position in May."}

He says he supports the President\u2019s position. He says that he voted for the resolution. Well just let me point this out; he voted for the resolution in 1955 which gave the president the power to use the forces of the United States to defend Formosa and the offshore islands. But he also voted then for an amendment \u2013 which was lost, fortunately \u2013 an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p- right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on Formosa. He repeated that error in 1959, in the speech that he made. He repeated it again in a television debate that we had. Now, my point is this: Senator Kennedy has got to be consistent here. Either he\u2019s for the President and he\u2019s against the position that those who opposed the President in fifty-five and fifty-nine \u2013 and the Senator\u2019s position itself, stated the other day in our debate \u2013 either he is for the President and against that position or we simply have a disagreement here that must continue to be debated. Now if the Senator in his answer to this question will say \u201cI now will depart, or retract my previous views; I think I was wrong in I 955; I think I was wrong in 1959; and I think I was wrong in our television debate to say that we should draw a line leaving out Quemoy and Matsu \u2013 draw a line in effect abandoning these islands to the Communists;\u201d then this will be right out of the campaign because there will be no issue between us. I support the President\u2019s position. I have always opposed drawing a line. I have opposed drawing a line because I know that the moment you draw a line, that is an encouragement for the Communists to attack \u2013 to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want. And so I would hope that Senator Kennedy in his answer today would clear it up. It isn\u2019t enough for him to say \u201cI support the President\u2019s position, that I voted for the resolution.\u201d Of course, he voted for the resolution \u2013 it was virtually unanimous. But the point is, what about his error in voting for the amendment, which was not adopted, and then persisting in it in fifty-nine, persisting in it in the debate. It\u2019s very simple for him to clear it up. He can say now that he no longer believes that a line should be drawn leaving these islands out of the perimeter of defense. If he says that, this issue will not be discussed in the campaign."}

I served it uh \u2013 in the war. I\u2019m devoted to it. If I lose this election, I will continue in the Senate to try to build a stronger country. But I run because I believe this year the United States has a great opportunity to make a move forward, to make a determination here at home and around the world, that it\u2019s going to reestablish itself as a vigorous society. My judgment is that the Republican party has stood still here in the United States, and it\u2019s also stood still around the world. Uh \u2013 We\u2019re using about fifty percent of our steel capacity today. We had a recession in fifty-eight. We had a recession in fifty-four. We\u2019re not moving ahead in education the way we should. We didn\u2019t make a judgment in fifty-seven and fifty-six and fifty-five and fifty-four that outer space would be important. If we stand still here, if we appoint people to ambassadorships and positions in Washington who have a status quo outlook, who don\u2019t recognize that this is a revolutionary time, then the United States does not maintain its influence. And if we fail, the cause of freedom fails. I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again, to get our economy moving ahead, to set before the American people its goals, its unfinished business. And then throughout the world appoint the best people we can get, ambassadors who can speak the language \u2013 no mere \u2013 not merely people who made a political contribution but who can speak the language. Bring students here; let them see what kind of a country we have. Mr. Nixon said that we should not regard them as pawns in the cold war; we should identify ourselves with them. If that were true, why didn\u2019t we identify ourselves with the people of Africa? Why didn\u2019t we bring students over here? Why did we suddenly offer Congo three hundred students last June when they had the tremendous revolt? That was more than we had offered to all of Africa before from the federal government. I believe that this party \u2013 Republican party \u2013 has stood still really for twenty-five years \u2013 its leadership has. It opposed all of the programs of President Roosevelt and others \u2013 the minimum wage and for housing and economic growth and development of our natural resources, the Tennessee Valley and all the rest. And I believe that if we can get a party which believes in movement, which believes in going ahead, then we can reestablish our position in the world \u2013 strong defense, strong in economic growth, justice for our people, co- guarantee of constitutional rights, so that people will believe that we practice what we preach, and then around the world, particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which existed in Latin America at the time of Franklin Roosevelt. He was a good neighbor in Latin America because he was a good neighbor in the United States; because they saw us as a society that was compassionate, that cared about people, that was moving this country ahead. I believe it my responsibility as the leader of the Democratic party in 1960 to try to warn the American people that in this crucial time we can no longer afford to stand still. We can no longer afford to be second best. I want people all over the world to look to the United States again, to feel that we\u2019re on the move, to feel that our high noon is in the future. I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States, and that they\u2019re going to put this country back to work again. I don\u2019t believe that there is anything this country cannot do. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any burden, or any responsibility, that any American would not assume to protect his country, to protect our security, to advance the cause of freedom. And I believe it incumbent upon us now to do that. Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that that generation of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny. I believe in 1960 and sixty-one and two and three we have a rendezvous with destiny. And I believe it incumbent upon us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom; and to do that, we must give this country leadership and we must get America moving again."}

NIXON","Party":"Republican","Factor 1":5,"Factor 2":50,"Factor 3":1,"Factor 4":1,"Factor 5":-2,"Factor 6":3,"Text":"Senator Kennedy has said tonight again what he has said several times in the course of this \u2013 these debates and in the campaign, that American is standing still. America is not standing still. It has not been standing still. And let\u2019s set the record straight right now by looking at the record, as Al Smith used to say. He talks about housing. We built more houses in the last seven years than in any Administration and thirty percent more than in the previous Administration. We talk about schools \u2013 three times as many classrooms built in the past Administration \u2013 and Eisenhower \u2013 than under the Truman Administration. Let\u2019s talk about civil rights. More progress in the past eight years than in the whole eighty years before. He talks about the progress in the field of slum clearance and the like. We find four times as many projects undertaken and completed in this Administration than in the previous one. Anybody that says America has been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn\u2019t been traveling in America. He\u2019s been in some other country. Let\u2019s get that straight right away. Now the second point we have to understand is this, however. America has not been standing still. But America cannot stand pat. We can\u2019t stand pat for the reason that we\u2019re in a race, as I\u2019ve indicated. We can\u2019t stand pat because it is essential with the conflict that we have around the world that we not just hold our own, that we not keep just freedom for ourselves. It is essential that we extend freedom, extend it to all the world. And this means more than what we\u2019ve been doing. It means keeping America even stronger militarily than she is. It means seeing that our economy moves forward even faster than it has. It means making more progress in civil rights than we have so that we can be a splendid example for all the world to see \u2013 a democracy in action at its best. Now, looking at the other parts of the world \u2013 South America \u2013 talking about our record and the previous one. We had a good neighbor policy, yes. It sounded fine. But let\u2019s look at it. There were eleven dictators when we came into power in 1953 in Latin America. There are only three left. Let\u2019s look at Africa. Twenty new countries in Africa during the course of this Administration. Not one of them selected a Communist government. All of them voted for freedom \u2013 a free type of government. Does this show that Communism has the bigger pull, or freedom has the bigger pull? Am I trying to indicate that we have no problems in Africa or Latin America or Asia? Of course not. What I am trying to indicate is that the tide of history\u2019s on our side, and that we can keep it on our side, because we\u2019re on the right side. We\u2019re on the side of freedom. We\u2019re on the side of justice against the forces of slavery, against the forces of injustice. But we aren\u2019t going to move America forward and we aren\u2019t going to be able to lead the world to win this struggle for freedom if we have a permanent inferiority complex about American achievements. Because we are first in the world in space, as I\u2019ve indicated; we are first in science; we are first in education, and we\u2019re going to move even further ahead with the kind of leadership that we can provide in these years ahead. One other point I would make: what could you do? Senator Kennedy and I are candidates for the presidency of the United States. And in the years to come it will be written that one or the other of us was elected and that he was or was not a great president. What will determine whether Senator Kennedy or I, if I am elected, was a great president? It will not be our ambition that will determine it, because greatness is not something that is written on a campaign poster. It will be determined to the extent that we represent the deepest ideals, the highest feelings and faith of the American people. In other words, the next president, as he leads America and the free world, can be only as great as the American people are great. And so I say in conclusion, keep America\u2019s faith strong. See that the young people of America, particularly, have faith in the ideals of freedom and faith in God, which distinguishes us from the atheistic materialists who oppose us."}

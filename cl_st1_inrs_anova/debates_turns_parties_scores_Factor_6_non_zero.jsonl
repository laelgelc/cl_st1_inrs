We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, said she\u2019s the single greatest student he\u2019s ever had. He\u2019s been a professor for a long time at a great school.

And I want to thank the Commission and the University of Utah for hosting this event. And Senator Harris, it\u2019s a privilege to be on the stage with you. Our nation has gone through a very challenging time this year. But I want the American people to know that from the very first day, President Donald Trump has put the health of America first. Before there were more than five cases in the United States, all people who had returned from China, President Donald Trump did what no other American president had ever done. And that was he suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now, Senator, Joe Biden opposed that decision. He said it was xenophobic and hysterical, but I can tell you, having led the White House Coronavirus Task Force, that that decision alone by President Trump bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War II. And I believe it\u2019s saved hundreds of thousands of American lives. Because with that time we were able to reinvent testing. More than 115 million tests have been done to date. We were able to see to the delivery of billions of supplies so our doctors and nurses had the resources and support they needed. And we began, really before the month of February it was hard to develop a vaccine and to develop medicines and therapeutics that\u2019ve been saving lives all along the way. And under President Trump\u2019s leadership, Operation Warp Speed, we believe, will have literally tens of millions of doses of a vaccine before the end of this year. The reality is, when you look at the Biden plan, it reads an awful lot like what President Trump and I and our task force have been doing every step of the way. And quite frankly, when I look at their plan that talks about advancing testing, creating new PPE, developing a vaccine, umm, it looks a little bit like plagiarism, which is something Joe Biden knows a little bit about. I think the American people know that this is a president who has put the health of America first and the American people, I believe with my heart, can be proud of the sacrifices they have made. It\u2019s saved countless American lives."}

Joe Biden believes you measure the health and the strength of America\u2019s economy based on the health, and the strength of the American worker and the American family. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who measures the strength of the economy based on how rich people are doing. Which is why he passed a tax bill benefitting the top 1% and the biggest corporations of America, leading to a $2 trillion deficit that the American people are gonna have to pay for. On day one, Joe Biden will repeal that tax bill. He\u2019ll get rid of it. And what he\u2019ll do with the money is invest it in the American people. And through a plan that is about investing in infrastructure, something that Donald Trump said he would do. I remember hearing about some infrastructure week, I don\u2019t think it ever happened. But Joe Biden will do that. He\u2019ll invest in infrastructure. It\u2019s about upgrading our roads and bridges, but also investing in clean energy and renewable energy. Joe is gonna invest that money in what we need to do around innovation. There was a time when our country believed in science and invested in research and development so that we were an innovation leader on the globe. Joe Biden will use that money to invest in education. So for example, for folks who want to go to a two year Community College, it will be free. If you come from a family that makes less than $125,000, you\u2019ll go to a public university for free. And across the board, we\u2019ll make sure that if you have student loan debt it\u2019s cut by $10,000. That\u2019s how Joe Biden thinks about the economy, which is it\u2019s about investing in the people of our country, as opposed to passing a tax bill, which had the benefit of letting American corporations go offshore to do their business."}

And Joe Biden wants to repeal all of the tariffs that President Trump put into effect to fight for American jobs and American workers. Joe Biden says democracy\u2019s on the ballot.

That is a fact. That is a fact. I will repeat that Joe Biden has been very clear that he thinks about growing jobs, which is why he will not increase taxes for anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. Joe Biden\u2019s economic plan \u2013 Moody\u2019s, which is a reputable Wall Street firm \u2013 has said will create 7 million more jobs than Donald Trump\u2019s. And part of those jobs, that will be created by Joe Biden, are going to be about clean energy and renewable energy. Because you see, Joe understands that the West Coast of our country is burning, including my home state of California. Joe sees what is happening on the Gulf states, which are being battered by storms. Joe has seen and talked with the farmers in Iowa, whose entire crops have been destroyed because of floods. And so Joe believes, again, in science. I\u2019ll tell you something, Susan, I served, when I first got to the Senate, on the committee that\u2019s responsible for the environment. Do you know this administration took the word science off the website? And then took the phrase climate change off the website? This\u2013 We have seen a pattern with this administration which is they don\u2019t believe in science. And Joe\u2019s plan is about saying we\u2019re going to deal with it, but we\u2019re also going to create jobs. Donald Trump, when asked about the wildfires in California and the question was, you know, the science is telling us this, you know what Donald Trump said? Science doesn\u2019t know. So, let\u2019s talk about who is prepared to lead our country over the course of the next four years on what is an existential threat to us as human beings. Joe is about saying we\u2019re going to invest that in renewable energy, we\u2019re going to be about the creation of millions of jobs, we will achieve net zero emissions by 2050, carbon neutral by 2035\u2013 Joe has a plan.

And with regard to banning fracking, I just recommend that people look at the record. You yourself said repeatedly that you would ban fracking. You were the first senate co-sponsor of the Green New Deal. And while Joe Biden denied the Green New Deal, Susan, thank you for pointing out, the Green New Deal is on their campaign website. And as USA TODAY said, it\u2019s essentially the same plan as you co-sponsored with AOC when she submitted it in the Senate. And you just heard the senator say that she\u2019s going to resubmit America to the Paris Climate Accord. Look, the American people have always cherished our environment. We will continue to cherish it. We\u2019ve made great progress reducing CO2 emissions through American innovation and the development of natural gas through fracking.

First of all, Joe Biden and I are both people of faith. And it\u2019s insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith, and in fact, Joe if elected will be only the second practicing Catholic, as President of the United States. On the issue of this nomination \u2013 Joe and I are very clear, as are the majority of the American people. We are 27 days before the decision about who will be the next president of the United States. And you know before, when this conversation has come up, you know it\u2019s been about election year or election time. We\u2019re literally in an election. Over 4 million people have voted. People are in the process of voting right now. And so Joe has been very clear, as the American people are: Let the American people fill that seat in the White House, and then we\u2019ll fill that seat on the United States Supreme Court. And to your point, Susan, the issues before us couldn\u2019t be more serious. There\u2019s the issue of choice, and I will always fight for a woman\u2019s right to make a decision about her own body. It should be her decision and not that of Donald Trump, and the Vice President, Michael Pence. But let\u2019s also look at what else is before the court. It\u2019s the Affordable Care Act. Like, literally in the midst of a public health pandemic \u2013 when over 210,000 people have died and 7 million people probably have what will be in the future considered a pre-existing condition because you contracted the virus \u2013 Donald Trump is in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I\u2019ve said it before and it bears repeating: This means that there will be no more protections, if they win, for people with pre-existing conditions. This means that over 20 million people will lose your coverage. It means that if you\u2019re under the age of 26, you can\u2019t stay on your parents coverage anymore. And here\u2019s the thing. The contrast couldn\u2019t be more clear. They\u2019re trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Joe Biden is saying let\u2019s expand coverage, let\u2019s give you a choice of a public option or private coverage, let\u2019s bring down premiums, let\u2019s lower Medicare eligibility to 60.

When you speak about the Supreme Court, though, I think the American people really deserve an answer, Senator Harris. Are you and Joe Biden gonna pack the court if Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed? I mean, there have been 29 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years, from George Washington to Barack Obama. Presidents have nominated in all 29 cases.

Abraham Lincoln was up for reelection, and it was 27 days before the election, and a seat became open on the United States Supreme Court. Abraham Lincoln\u2019s party was in charge, not only in the White House, but the Senate. But honest Abe said it\u2019s not the right thing to do.

And her life was taken, unjustifiably and tragically and violently. And it just, it brings me to, you know, the eight minutes and 46 seconds that America witnessed, during which an American man was tortured and killed under the knee of an armed, uniformed police officer. And people around our country, of every race, of every age, of every gender \u2013 perfect strangers to each other \u2013 marched shoulder to shoulder, arm and arm, fighting for us to finally achieve that ideal of equal justice under law.

We need reform of our policing in America and our criminal justice system, which is why Joe and I will immediately ban chokeholds and carotid holds. George Floyd would be alive today if we did that. We will require a national registry for police officers who break the law, we will \u2013 on the issue of criminal justice reform \u2013 get rid of private prisons and cash bail and we will decriminalize marijuana, and we will expunge the records of those who have been convicted of marijuana.

By rioters and looters. And Flora is still trying to put her life back together. And I must tell ya, this, this presumption that you hear consistently from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, that America is systemically racist. That as Joe Biden said, that he believes that law enforcement has an implicit bias against minorities, is a great insult to the men and women who serve in law enforcement. And I want everyone to know, who puts on the uniform of law enforcement every day, that President Trump and I stand with you. It is remarkable that when Senator Tim Scott tried to pass a police reform bill, brought together a group of Republicans and Democrats \u2013 Senator Harris, you got up and walked out of the room. And then you filibustered Senator Tim Scott\u2019s bill on the Senate floor that would have provided new accountability, new resources.

Because while Joe Biden and Kamala Harris rattle off a long litany, the establishment in Washington DC and the establishment Joe Biden\u2019s been a part of for 47 years. President Donald Trump has launched a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life. And I have every confidence that the same Americans that delivered that historic victory in 2016, they see this President\u2019s record, where we rebuild our military, we revived our economy through tax cuts and rolling back regulation, fighting for fair trade, unleashing American energy. We appointed conservatives to our federal courts at every level. And we stood with the men and women of law enforcement every single day, and I think, I think that movement of Americans has only grown stronger in the last four years. When you talk about accepting the outcome of the election, I must tell you, Senator, your party has spent the last three and a half years trying to overturn the results of the last election. It\u2019s amazing. When Joe Biden was vice president of the United States, the FBI actually spied on President Trump and my campaign. I mean there were documents released this week that the CIA actually made a referral to the FBI documenting that those allegations were coming from the Hillary Clinton campaign, and of course, we\u2019ve all seen the avalanche with the \u2014 what, what you put the country through, for the better part of three years, until it was found that there was no obstruction, no collusion, case closed. And then Senator Harris, you and your colleagues in the Congress tried to impeach the President of the United States, over a phone call. And now Hillary Clinton has actually said to Joe Biden that under, in her words, under no circumstances should he concede the election. So let me just say, I think we\u2019re gonna win this election. President Trump and I are fighting every day in courthouses to prevent Joe Biden and Kamala Harris from changing the rules and creating this universal mail-in voting, that\u2019ll create a massive opportunity for voter fraud. We have a free and fair election; we know we\u2019re going to have confidence in it. And I believe in all my heart that President Donald Trump\u2019s gonna be reelected for four more years."}

I would tell you that \u2013 don\u2019t assume that what you\u2019re seeing on your local news networks is synonymous with the American people. You know, I look at the relationship between Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the late justice who we just lost from the Supreme Court, and the late Justice Antonin Scalia. They were on polar opposites, on the Supreme Court of the United States \u2013 one very liberal, one very conservative. But what\u2019s been learned since her passing was the two of them and their families were the very closest of friends. Here in America, we can disagree, we can debate vigorously as Senator Harris and I have on this stage tonight. But when the debate is over, we come together as Americans. And that\u2019s what people do in big cities and small towns all across this country, so I just want to encourage you, Brecklynn, I want to tell you that we\u2019re going to work every day to have a government as good as our people, the American people, each and every day.

And secondly, we\u2019re in a situation here where we \u2014 the federal prison system was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration. And one of these things we should be doing is there should be no, no minimum mandatories in the law. That\u2019s why I\u2019m offering $20 billion to states to change their state laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts. No one should be going to jail because they have a drug problem. They should be going to rehabilitation, not to jail. We should fundamentally change the system and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do."}

The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we\u2019ll build together. Today is my granddaughter\u2019s second birthday, so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes. I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women\u2019s work. I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top. And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. I\u2019ve heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you\u2019re under. So let\u2019s have paid family leave, earned sick days. Let\u2019s be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college. How are we going to do it? We\u2019re going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes. Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it\u2019s good to be with you. We\u2019re going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better. I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th."}

Of course, we are 5 percent of the world\u2019s population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent. And we need to have smart, fair trade deals. We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions. And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again. In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we\u2019ve ever had. I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that\u2019s exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy. We just have a different view about what\u2019s best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes. I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives. I understand that. You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that\u2019s all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we\u2019ll be and that everything will work out from there. I don\u2019t buy that. I have a different experience. My father was a small-businessman. He worked really hard. He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going. And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we\u2019ll grow. That\u2019s the kind of economy I want us to see again."}

You learn a lot from financial disclosure. And you should go down and take a look at that. The other thing, I\u2019m extremely underleveraged. The report that said $650\u2014which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that\u2019s really not a lot of money. It\u2019s not a lot of money relative to what I had. The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was\u2014actually, it wasn\u2019t even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion.

It\u2019s because it\u2019s about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money. When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country\u2019s a mess, you know, it\u2019s one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything\u2019s in great shape, our airports. Our airports are like from a third world country.

So the worst of all things has happened. We owe $20 trillion, and we\u2019re a mess. We haven\u2019t even started. And we\u2019ve spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw. Whether it\u2019s 6 or 5, but it looks like it\u2019s 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice. And it\u2019s really a shame. And it\u2019s politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. We\u2019re a debtor nation. We\u2019re a serious debtor nation.

We\u2019ve just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte. And we\u2019ve got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police.

But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform. So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. And we\u2019ve got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together. So we have to do two things, as I said. We have to restore trust. We have to work with the police. We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them. And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we\u2019re seeing today."}

There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective. Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective. It did not do what it needed to do. Now, I believe in community policing. And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991. Property crime is down 40 percent. We just don\u2019t want to see it creep back up. We\u2019ve had 25 years of very good cooperation. But there were some problems, some unintended consequences. Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses. And it\u2019s just a fact that if you\u2019re a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated. So we\u2019ve got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. We cannot just say law and order. We have to say\u2014we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little. We need to have more second chance programs. I\u2019m glad that we\u2019re ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system. You shouldn\u2019t have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans. So there are some positive ways we can work on this. And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us. Right now\u2014and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby\u2014right now, we\u2019ve got too many military-style weapons on the streets. In a lot of places, our police are outgunned. We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm. And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who\u2019s on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country. If you\u2019re too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way."}

But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers. I\u2019ve met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. They admit it\u2019s an issue. They\u2019ve got a lot of concerns. Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.

Five hundred murders is a lot of murders. It\u2019s hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good? But we went from 2,200 to 500. And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg.

But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states. The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia. There\u2019s no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this.

I was just endorsed by ICE. I was just recently endorsed\u201416,500 Border Patrol agents. So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I\u2019ll take the admirals and I\u2019ll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge. OK? Because look at the mess that we\u2019re in. Look at the mess that we\u2019re in. As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we\u2019re not. I don\u2019t think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. She\u2019s saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don\u2019t\u2014maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK? You don\u2019t know who broke in to DNC. But what did we learn with DNC? We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Look what happened to her. But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of. That\u2019s what we learned. Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don\u2019t know, because the truth is, under President Obama we\u2019ve lost control of things that we used to have control over. We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they\u2019re beating us at our own game. ISIS. So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is\u2014it is a huge problem. I have a son. He\u2019s 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it\u2019s unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it\u2019s hardly doable.

And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I\u2019ve ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal. Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea. And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places. And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn\u2019t you do that? Why didn\u2019t you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobody\u2019s ever seen that before.

It is so great to be back at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. This is a very special place. Sixty-five years ago, a young, courageous woman, Barbara Johns, led a walkout of her high school, Moton High School. She made history by protesting school segregation. She believed our nation was stronger together. And that walkout led to the Brown v. Board of Education decision that moved us down the path toward equality. I am so proud to be running with another strong, history-making woman, Hillary Clinton, to be president of the United States. I\u2019m proud because her vision of stronger together, building an economy that works for all, not just those at the top, being safe in the world not only with a strong military, but also strong alliances to battle terrorism and climate change, and also to build a community of respect, just like Barbara Johns tried to do 65 years ago. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so proud to be her running mate. Hillary told me why she asked me to be her running mate. She said the test of a Clinton administration will not be the signing of a bill or the passage of a bill. It\u2019ll be whether we can make somebody\u2019s life better, whether we can make a classroom better learning environment for schoolkids or teachers, whether we can make a safer \u2014 it\u2019s going to be about results. And she said to me, you\u2019ve been a missionary and a civil rights lawyer. You\u2019ve been a city councilman and mayor. You\u2019ve been a lieutenant governor and governor and now a U.S. senator. I think you will help me figure out how to govern this nation so that we always keep in mind that the success of the administration is the difference we make in people\u2019s lives. And that\u2019s what I bring to the ticket, that experience having served at all levels of government. But my primary role is to be Hillary Clinton\u2019s right-hand person and strong supporter as she puts together the most historic administration possible. And I relish that role. I\u2019m so proud of her. I\u2019ll just say this: We trust Hillary Clinton, my wife and I, and we trust her with the most important thing in our life. We have a son deployed overseas in the Marine Corps right now. We trust Hillary Clinton as president and commander-in-chief, but the thought of Donald Trump as commander-in-chief scares us to death."}

And have they held onto that passion throughout their life, regardless of whether they were in office or not, succeeding or failing? Hillary Clinton has that passion. From a time as a kid in a Methodist youth group in the suburbs of Chicago, she has been focused on serving others with a special focus on empowering families and kids. As a civil rights lawyer in the South, with the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, first lady of Arkansas and this country, senator, secretary of state, it\u2019s always been about putting others first. And that\u2019s a sharp contrast with Donald Trump. Donald Trump always puts himself first. He built a business career, in the words of one of his own campaign staffers, \u201coff the backs of the little guy.\u201d And as a candidate, he started his campaign with a speech where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals, and he has pursued the discredited and really outrageous lie that President Obama wasn\u2019t born in the United States. It is so painful to suggest that we go back to think about these days where an African-American could not be a citizen of the United States.

I mean, I\u2019m very proud of the fact that \u2014 I come from a state that works. The state of Indiana has balanced budgets. We cut taxes, we\u2019ve made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank. That\u2019s a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia. He actually \u2014 he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion. He left his state about $2 billion in the hole. In the state of Indiana, we\u2019ve cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor. But I think he\u2019s a very fitting running mate for Hillary Clinton, because in the wake of a season where American families are struggling in this economy under the weight of higher taxes and Obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same. It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that. You tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful. But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan. But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare. They want to expand it into a single-payer program. And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start. Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy. We can get America moving again. Put on top of that the kind of trade deals that\u2019ll put the American worker first, and you\u2019ve got a prescription for real growth. And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, that\u2019s when you can deal with the national debt. When we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth with Donald Trump\u2019s plan will do, then we\u2019re going to have the resources to meet our nation\u2019s needs at home and abroad, and we\u2019re going to have the ability to bring down the national debt."}

Do you want a \u201cyou\u2019re hired\u201d president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d president in Donald Trump? I think that\u2019s not such a hard choice. Hillary and I have a plan that\u2019s on the table that\u2019s a \u201cyou\u2019re hired\u201d plan. Five components. First thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow. Second thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year. Third, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you can\u2019t work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work. Fourth, we promote small business growth, just as we\u2019ve done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses. Hillary and I each grew up in small-business families. My dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight. And, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top who\u2019ve benefited as we\u2019ve come out of recession to pay more. The Trump plan is a different plan. It\u2019s a \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d plan. And there\u2019s two key elements to it. First, Donald Trump said wages are too high. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage. Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15. And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana. The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump. The problem with this, Elaine, is that\u2019s exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession \u2014 the deepest recession since the 1930s. Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs. The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs. And Donald Trump \u2014 why would he do this? Because his tax plan basically helps him.

I think we put a lot on police shoulders. And this is something I got a lot of scar tissue and experience on. I was a city councilman and mayor in Richmond. And when I came in, we had one of the highest homicide rates in the United States. We fought very, very hard over the course of my time in local office with our police department, and we reduced our homicide rate nearly in half. And then when I was governor of Virginia, we worked hard, too. And we did something we had really wanted to do. For the first time ever, we cracked the top 10, 10 safest states, because we worked together. Here\u2019s what I learned as a mayor and a governor. The way you make communities safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing. You build the bonds between the community and the police force, build bonds of understanding, and then when people feel comfortable in their communities, that gap between the police and the communities they serve narrows. And when that gap narrows, it\u2019s safer for the communities and it\u2019s safer for the police. That model still works across our country, but there are some other models that don\u2019t work, an overly aggressive, more militarized model. Donald Trump recently said we need to do more stop-and-frisk around the country. That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community. So here\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. We\u2019ll focus on community policing. We will focus on \u2014 and Hillary Clinton has rolled out a really comprehensive mental health reform package that she worked on with law enforcement professionals, and we will also fight the scourge of gun violence in the United States. I\u2019m a gun-owner. I\u2019m a strong Second Amendment supporter. But I\u2019ve got a lot of scar tissue, because when I was governor of Virginia, there was a horrible shooting at Virginia Tech, and we learned that through that painful situation that gaps in the background record check system should have been closed and it could have prevented that crime, and so we\u2019re going to work to do things like close background record checks. And if we do, we won\u2019t have the tragedies that we did. One of those killed at Virginia Tech was a guy named Liviu Librescu. He was a 70-plus-year-old Romanian Holocaust survivor. He had survived the Holocaust. Then he survived the Soviet Union takeover of his country. But then he was a visiting professor at Virginia Tech, and he couldn\u2019t survive the scourge of gun violence. We can support the Second Amendment and do things like background record checks and make us safer, and that will make police safer, too."}

And the small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States to the point where all the United States of America \u2014 the greatest nation on Earth \u2014 just withdraws from talks about a cease-fire while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria while he marshals the forces and begins \u2014 look, we have got to begin to lean into this with strong, broad-shouldered American leadership.

We\u2019ve got to work with the Congress, and Donald Trump will, to rebuild our military and project American strength in the world.

And secondly, I just have to tell you that the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength. And if Russia chooses to be involved and continue, I should say, to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo. There\u2019s a broad range of other things that we ought to do, as well.

So, on the foundation. I am glad to talk about the foundation. The Clinton Foundation is one of the highest- rated charities in the world. It provides AIDS drugs to about 11.5 million people. It helps Americans deal with opioid overdoses. It gets higher rankings for its charity than the American Red Cross does. The Clinton Foundation does an awful lot of good work. Hillary Clinton as secretary of state took no action to benefit the foundation. The State Department did an investigation, and they concluded that everything Hillary Clinton did as secretary of state was completely in the interest of the United States. So the foundation does good work. And Hillary Clinton as secretary of state acted in the interests of the United States. But let\u2019s compare this now with the Trump organization and the Trump Foundation. The Trump organization is an octopus-like organization with tentacles all over the world whose conflict of interests could only be known if Donald Trump would release his tax returns. He\u2019s refused to do it. His sons have said that the organization has a lot of business dealings in Russia. And remember, the Trump organization is not a non-profit. It\u2019s putting money into Donald Trump\u2019s pockets and into the pockets of his children, whereas the Clinton Foundation is a non-profit and no Clinton family member draws any salary."}

It\u2019s an easy one. I\u2019m really fortunate. I grew up in a wonderful household with great Irish Catholic parents. My mom and dad are sitting right here. I was educated by Jesuits at Rockhurst High School in Kansas City. My 40th reunion is in 10 days. And I worked with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras, now nearly 35 years ago, and they were the heroes of my life. I try to practice my religion in a very devout way and follow the teachings of my church in my own personal life. But I don\u2019t believe in this nation, a First Amendment nation, where we don\u2019t raise any religion over the other, and we allow people to worship as they please, that the doctrines of any one religion should be mandated for everyone. For me, the hardest struggle in my faith life was the Catholic Church is against the death penalty and so am I. But I was governor of a state, and the state law said that there was a death penalty for crimes if the jury determined them to be heinous. And so I had to grapple with that. When I was running for governor, I was attacked pretty strongly because of my position on the death penalty. But I looked the voters of Virginia in the eye and said, look, this is my religion. I\u2019m not going to change my religious practice to get one vote, but I know how to take an oath and uphold the law. And if you elect me, I will uphold the law. And I was elected, and I did. It was very, very difficult to allow executions to go forward, but in circumstances where I didn\u2019t feel like there was a case for clemency, I told Virginia voters I would uphold the law, and I did. That was a real struggle. But I think it is really, really important that those of us who have deep faith lives don\u2019t feel like we could just substitute our own views for everybody else in society, regardless of their views."}

And I\u2019m going to fix it, because I agree with you. Premiums have gotten too high. Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I\u2019ve laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down. But here\u2019s what I don\u2019t want people to forget when we\u2019re talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn\u2019t just that 20 million people got insurance who didn\u2019t have it before. But that in and of itself was a good thing. I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families. But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employers got big benefits. Number one, insurance companies can\u2019t deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems. Number three, women can\u2019t be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act. Number four, if you\u2019re under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn\u2019t happen before. So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act. But we\u2019ve got to get costs down. We\u2019ve got to provide some additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance. But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange. And then we would have to start all over again. Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage. That\u2019s the highest we\u2019ve ever been in our country."}

It\u2019s only getting worse. In \u201917, it implodes by itself. Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money. We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt. Obamacare will never work. It\u2019s very bad, very bad health insurance. Far too expensive. And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. It\u2019s going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly. We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored. We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want\u2014and President Obama and whoever was working on it\u2014they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies. We want competition. You will have the finest health care plan there is. She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada. And if you haven\u2019t noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow. It\u2019s catastrophic in certain ways. But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything. Hillary Clinton has been after this for years.

Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they\u2019re trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia. I know\u2014I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia. I don\u2019t deal there. I have no businesses there. I have no loans from Russia. I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office. One of the primary things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet. But I have no loans with Russia. You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have. Now, the taxes are a very simple thing. As soon as I have\u2014first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. Many of her friends took bigger deductions. Warren Buffett took a massive deduction. Soros, who\u2019s a friend of hers, took a massive deduction. Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her\u2014took massive deductions. I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. But\u2014but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I\u2019ll release my returns. I\u2019ll be very proud to. They\u2019re actually quite great."}

She\u2019s a United States\u2014she was a United States senator. She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code. Well, why didn\u2019t she change it? Why didn\u2019t you change it when you were a senator? The reason you didn\u2019t is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do. And I do. You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change. But you wouldn\u2019t change it, because all of these people give you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump. But\u2014and I say that about a lot of things. You know, I\u2019ve heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years. \u201cI wish you would have done this.\u201d But she\u2019s been there for 30 years she\u2019s been doing this stuff. She never changed. And she never will change. She never will change. We\u2019re getting rid of carried interest provisions. I\u2019m lowering taxes actually, because I think it\u2019s so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving\u2014massive corporations and little ones, little ones can\u2019t form. We\u2019re getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes. But we\u2019re bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent. We\u2019re cutting taxes for the middle class. And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class. And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks. You can look at me. She\u2019s raising your taxes really high. And what that\u2019s going to do is a disaster for the country. But she is raising your taxes and I\u2019m lowering your taxes. That in itself is a big difference. We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. There\u2019s no growth. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it\u2019s like a national catastrophe. We\u2019re down at 1 percent. And that\u2019s, like, no growth. And we\u2019re going lower, in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world. And I\u2019m bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think it\u2019s so important\u2014one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybody\u2019s taxes massively."}

I\u2019m sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality. And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn\u2019t paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he\u2019s going to do. But I\u2019ll tell you what he\u2019s going to do. His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they\u2019ve ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two. Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift. And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families. Now, here\u2019s what I want to do. I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year\u2014and that\u2019s the vast majority of Americans as you know\u2014will have their taxes raised, because I think we\u2019ve got to go where the money is. And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code. And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes. I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes. I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars. It\u2019s called the Buffett rule. Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who\u2019s gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million. We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you. I want to invest in hard-working families. And I think it\u2019s been unfortunate, but it\u2019s happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top. And we need to reverse that. People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong."}

Hillary Clinton\u2014and it\u2019s extremely complex\u2014Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people. But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary\u2019s leaving. Very interesting why she\u2019s leaving carried interest. But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes. I absolutely used it.

Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system. After 9\/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it. Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done. When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women\u2019s rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons. Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years. I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.

And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime. Russia hasn\u2019t paid any attention to ISIS. They\u2019re interested in keeping Assad in power. So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones. We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them. And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground. But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia. Russia has decided that it\u2019s all in, in Syria. And they\u2019ve also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it\u2019s not me. I\u2019ve stood up to Russia. I\u2019ve taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president. I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that\u2019s fine. And I did as secretary of state. That\u2019s how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons. It\u2019s how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now. But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable."}

Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world. Not in this country. It stripped us of manufacturing jobs. We lost our jobs. We lost our money. We lost our plants. It is a disaster. And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she\u2019s for it. She called it the gold standard.

And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I\u2019ve been in public service. I\u2019m proud of that. You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system. I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about. I have worked with Latinos\u2014one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote. So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that every American feels like he or she has a place in our country. And I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn\u2019t have a place in Donald Trump\u2019s America. They write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix. She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. He\u2019s 10 years old now. This is the only country he\u2019s ever known. And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected? You know, children listen to what is being said. To go back to the very, very first question. And there\u2019s a lot of fear\u2014in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect. Bullying is up.

So I believe that this election has become in part so\u2014so conflict-oriented, so intense because there\u2019s a lot at stake. This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election. We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake. It\u2019s one of the most consequential elections that we\u2019ve had. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president. And that\u2019s why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I\u2019ve spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families.

I don\u2019t want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country. We have 11 million undocumented people. They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people. He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation. Now, here\u2019s what that means. It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented. And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country. I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation. I think it\u2019s an idea that would rip our country apart. I have been for border security for years. I voted for border security in the United States Senate. And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security. But I want to put our resources where I think they\u2019re most needed: Getting rid of any violent person. Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them. When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president. Didn\u2019t even raise it. He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we\u2019re not paying for that wall. So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with a path to citizenship."}

New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses. I want us to do more to help small business. That\u2019s where two-thirds of the new jobs are going to come from. I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not\u2014who work full-time should not still be in poverty. And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do. I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college. That\u2019s why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future. I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted. And we\u2019re going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is. Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top. So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share. We\u2019re going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country. That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs. By contrast, Donald\u2019s plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs. Why? Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids. So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities. The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession."}

We have, during his regime, during President Obama\u2019s regime, we\u2019ve doubled our national debt. We\u2019re up to $20 trillion. So my plan\u2014we\u2019re going to renegotiate trade deals. We\u2019re going to have a lot of free trade. We\u2019re going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now. But we have horrible deals. Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever. Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy. You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them. You go upstate New York. Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places. We\u2019re bringing our jobs back. I am going to renegotiate NAFTA. And if I can\u2019t make a great deal\u2014then we\u2019re going to terminate NAFTA and we\u2019re going to create new deals. We\u2019re going to have trade, but we\u2019re going\u2014we\u2019re going to terminate it, we\u2019re going to make a great trade deal. And if we can\u2019t, we\u2019re going to do it\u2014we\u2019re going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster. We are going to cut taxes massively. We\u2019re going to cut business taxes massively. They\u2019re going to start hiring people. We\u2019re going to bring the $2.5 trillion\u2026"}

I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less. I also will not add a penny to the debt. I have costed out what I\u2019m going to do. He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt. Well, he mentioned the debt. We know how to get control of the debt. When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt. When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression. He has cut the deficit by two-thirds. So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people. So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead. That\u2019s the kind of approach that will work."}

But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force. I don\u2019t think that is in our interest, and I don\u2019t think that would be smart to do. In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself. The goal here is to take back Mosul. It\u2019s going to be a hard fight. I\u2019ve got no illusions about that. And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters. I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real\u2014a really successful military operation. But we know we\u2019ve got lots of work to do. Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue. So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS. That\u2019s why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don\u2019t let terrorists buy weapons. If you\u2019re too dangerous to fly, you\u2019re too dangerous to buy a gun. And I\u2019m going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track."}

I\u2019m well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general. This would not be done just on the first day. This would take a lot of negotiation. And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground. We\u2019ve had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated. So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS. But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees. He\u2019s made these claims repeatedly. I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in. But I am not going to slam the door on women and children. That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting. And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting. That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks. In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born. So let\u2019s be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it. And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we\u2019ve got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home."}

And before he rushes and says, \u201cYou know, before you and President Obama were there,\u201d I think it\u2019s important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades. You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world. He was criticizing President Reagan. This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, \u201cYou know, I alone can fix it,\u201d as he said on the convention stage. But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I\u2019m proposing. I do not add a penny to the national debt. I take that very seriously, because I do think it\u2019s one of the issues we\u2019ve got to come to grips with. So when I talk about how we\u2019re going to pay for education, how we\u2019re going to invest in infrastructure, how we\u2019re going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I\u2019ve made it very clear we are going where the money is. We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share. And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth. In fact, I think just the opposite. We\u2019ll have what economists call middle-out growth. We\u2019ve got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America. That\u2019s where growth will come from. That\u2019s why I want to invest in you. I want to invest in your family. And I think that\u2019s the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer.

But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt. That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare. And I\u2019ll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal. The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund.

I want to thank Governor Romney and the University of Denver for your hospitality. There are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me. And so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people. You know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Millions of jobs were lost, the auto industry was on the brink of collapse. The financial system had frozen up. And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, we\u2019ve begun to fight our way back. Over the last 30 months, we\u2019ve seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created. The auto industry has come roaring back. And housing has begun to rise. But we all know that we\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do. And so the question here tonight is not where we\u2019ve been, but where we\u2019re going. Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that we\u2019ll be better off. I\u2019ve got a different view. I think we\u2019ve got to invest in education and training. I think it\u2019s important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that we\u2019re helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States, that we take some of the money that we\u2019re saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments. Now, it ultimately is going to be up to the voters \u2014 to you \u2014 which path we should take. Are we going to double on top-down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best?

I\u2019m sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine, here \u2014 here with me. So I\u2026 Congratulations. This is obviously a very tender topic. I\u2019ve had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country. I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm and she said, \u201cI\u2019ve been out of work since May. Can you help me?\u201d Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, \u201cAnn, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs. He\u2019s lost his most recent job and we\u2019ve now just lost our home. Can you help us?\u201d And the answer is, yes, we can help, but it\u2019s going to take a different path. Not the one we\u2019ve been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m going to do. My plan has five basic parts. One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent. That creates about 4 million jobs. Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America. Crack down on China, if and when they cheat. Number three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world. We\u2019re far away from that now. Number four, get to us a balanced budget. Number five, champion small business. It\u2019s small business that creates the jobs in America, and over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30-year low. Now, I\u2019m concerned that the path that we\u2019re on has just been unsuccessful. The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more \u2014 if you will, trickle-down government \u2014 would work. That\u2019s not the right answer for America. I\u2019ll restore the vitality that gets America working again. Thank you."}

First, we\u2019ve got to improve our education system and we\u2019ve made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools. We\u2019ve got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers. So now I want to hire another 100,000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now. And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people. When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent. But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States. On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we\u2019ve got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than they\u2019ve been in years. But I also believe that we\u2019ve got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments. So all of this is possible. Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code? And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments? And this is where there\u2019s a difference, because Governor Romney\u2019s central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut \u2014 on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts \u2014 that\u2019s another trillion dollars \u2014 and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn\u2019t asked for. That\u2019s $8 trillion. How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign."}

I\u2019d like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece. First of all, I don\u2019t have a $5 trillion tax cut. I don\u2019t have a tax cut of a scale that you\u2019re talking about. My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But I\u2019m not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people. High-income people are doing just fine in this economy. They\u2019ll do fine whether you\u2019re president or I am. The people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans. Under the president\u2019s policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. They\u2019re just being crushed. Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. This is a \u2014 this is a tax in and of itself. I\u2019ll call it the economy tax. It\u2019s been crushing. At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president. Electric rates are up. Food prices are up. Health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family. Middle-income families are being crushed. And so the question is how to get them going again. And I\u2019ve described it. It\u2019s energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business. Those are the \u2014 the cornerstones of my plan. But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I\u2019ll just note. First, education. I agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy. But our training programs right now, we\u2019ve got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. We\u2019ve got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them. The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down. And I do, both for corporations and for individuals. But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth. The third area, energy. Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up. But not due to his policies. In spite of his policies. Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half. If I\u2019m president, I\u2019ll double them, and also get the \u2014 the oil from offshore and Alaska. And I\u2019ll bring that pipeline in from Canada. And, by the way, I like coal. I\u2019m going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like it\u2019s getting crushed by your policies. I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs. And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, I\u2019m not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the \u2014 the revenues going to the government. My \u2014 my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit. But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans. And I \u2014 and to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans. So any \u2014 any language to the contrary is simply not accurate. LEHRER: Mr. President?"}

Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families. And that\u2019s exactly what I did. We cut taxes for middle-class families by about $3,600. And the reason is, because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well. And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car. They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through. They can buy a computer for their kid who\u2019s going off to college, which means they\u2019re spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers. Now, Governor Romney\u2019s proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem is that he\u2019s been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasn\u2019t been able to identify them. But I\u2019m going to make an important point here, Jim."}

And now, five weeks before the election, he\u2019s saying that his big, bold idea is, \u201cNever mind.\u201d And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s math. It\u2019s arithmetic. Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth. So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times. And what I want to do is continue the tax rates \u2014 the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families. But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot. And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we\u2019re also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy. And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business. Under \u2014 under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they\u2019re the job creators, they\u2019d be burdened. But under Governor Romney\u2019s definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business. Now, I know Donald Trump doesn\u2019t like to think of himself as small anything, but \u2014 but that\u2019s how you define small businesses if you\u2019re getting business income. And that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow. And I think that would be a mistake."}

And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis. And despite that, what we\u2019ve said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn\u2019t slip into a Great Depression, but what we\u2019ve also said is, let\u2019s make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow. So 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but weren\u2019t working very well, 18 government \u2014 18 government programs for education that were well-intentioned, not weren\u2019t helping kids learn, we went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars, $50 billion of waste taken out of the system. And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget. That\u2019s the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower. Now, we all know that we\u2019ve got to do more. And so I\u2019ve put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan. It\u2019s on a website. You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise. And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit. Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission. Well, that\u2019s how the commission \u2014 bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts. And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have. Let \u2014 let me just finish their point, because you\u2019re looking for contrast. You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue? And he said no. Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education. It means that Governor Romney\u2026 \u2026 talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities."}

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA","Moderators":"JIM LEHRER","Speaker":"OBAMA","Party":"Democratic","Factor 1":30,"Factor 2":0,"Factor 3":0,"Factor 4":-3,"Factor 5":7,"Factor 6":4,"Text":"If \u2014 if we\u2019re serious, we\u2019ve got to take a balanced, responsible approach. And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes. Let\u2019s talk about corporate taxes. Now, I\u2019ve identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually help the economy. The oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare. Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don\u2019t get. Now, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money, when they\u2019re making money every time you go to the pump? Why wouldn\u2019t we want to eliminate that? Why wouldn\u2019t we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets? My attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it. When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue neutral way, close loopholes, deductions \u2014 he hasn\u2019t identified which ones they are \u2014 but that thereby bring down the corporate rate. Well, I want to do the same thing, but I\u2019ve actually identified how we can do that. And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas. Right now, you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas. I think most Americans would say that doesn\u2019t make sense. And all that raises revenue. And so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college. It means that the teacher that I met in Las Vegas, a wonderful young lady, who describes to me \u2014 she\u2019s got 42 kids in her class. The first two weeks she\u2019s got them, some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned. They\u2019re using text books that are 10 years old. That is not a recipe for growth. That\u2019s not how America was built. And so budgets reflect choices. Ultimately, we\u2019re going to have to make some decisions. And if we\u2019re asking for no revenue, then that means that we\u2019ve got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff. And the magnitude of the tax cuts that you\u2019re talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow. As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we\u2019re talking about potentially a 30 \u2014 a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time. Now, you know, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is, you know, numbers on a sheet of paper, but if we\u2019re talking about a family who\u2019s got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid, that\u2019s a big problem. And governors are creative. There\u2019s no doubt about it. But they\u2019re not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid. What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help."}

Social Security is structurally sound. It\u2019s going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker \u2014 Democratic Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill. But it is \u2014 the basic structure is sound. But \u2014 but I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare, and then talk about Medicare, because that\u2019s the big driver of our deficits right now. You know, my grandmother \u2014 some of you know \u2014 helped to raise me. My grandparents did. My grandfather died a while back. My grandmother died three days before I was elected president. And she was fiercely independent. She worked her way up, only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank. And she ended up living alone by choice. And the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare. She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go. And that\u2019s the perspective I bring when I think about what\u2019s called entitlements. You know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks. These are folks who\u2019ve worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this. So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term? And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if we\u2019re going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, let\u2019s look where some of the money\u2019s going. $716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we weren\u2019t overpaying providers. And using that money, we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600, and we were also able to make a \u2014 make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the \u2014 throughout the system. So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs. When it comes to Social Security, as I said, you don\u2019t need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future."}

First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts. I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together. What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote. As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary \u2014 elected a Republican senator to stop Obamacare, you pushed it through anyway. So entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer and drove it through. What we did in a legislature 87 percent Democrat, we worked together; 200 legislators in my legislature, only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished. What were some differences? We didn\u2019t raise taxes. You\u2019ve raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare. We didn\u2019t cut Medicare. Of course, we don\u2019t have Medicare, but we didn\u2019t cut Medicare by $716 billion. We didn\u2019t put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they\u2019re going to receive. We didn\u2019t also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put \u2014 put people in a position where they\u2019re going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted. Right now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year. And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage. So for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance, this is why the American people don\u2019t want Medicare \u2014 don\u2019t want Obamacare. It\u2019s why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had \u2014 had the plan. They put a plan out. They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan. It was swept aside. I think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis. And we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties."}

But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan. Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan. That\u2019s already offered in the private marketplace. You don\u2019t have to have the government mandate that for that to occur. But let\u2019s come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it\u2019s more affordable for families. And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have. In my opinion, the government is not effective in \u2014 in bringing down the cost of almost anything. As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be. Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe. This is the private market. These are small \u2014 these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs. I used to consult to businesses \u2014 excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers. I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people. In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don\u2019t need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have. We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that\u2019s happening. Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others. But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have. That\u2019s the wrong way to go. The private market and individual responsibility always work best."}

That\u2019s its most basic function. And as commander-in-chief, that is something that I\u2019ve worked on and thought about every single day that I\u2019ve been in the Oval Office. But I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed. Look, the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions. But as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together. So, in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said, let\u2019s help to finance the Transcontinental Railroad, let\u2019s start the National Academy of Sciences, let\u2019s start land grant colleges, because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans, because if all Americans are getting opportunity, we\u2019re all going to be better off. That doesn\u2019t restrict people\u2019s freedom. That enhances it. And so what I\u2019ve tried to do as president is to apply those same principles. And when it comes to education what I\u2019ve said is we\u2019ve got to reform schools that are not working. We use something called Race to the Top. Wasn\u2019t a top-down approach, Governor. What we\u2019ve said is to states, we\u2019ll give you more money if you initiate reforms. And as a consequence, you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference. But what I\u2019ve also said is let\u2019s hire another 100,000 math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed. And hard-pressed states right now can\u2019t all do that. In fact we\u2019ve seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesn\u2019t think we need more teachers. I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help. It can\u2019t do it all, but it can make a difference. And as a consequence we\u2019ll have a better trained workforce and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where we\u2019ve got a skilled workforce."}

Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own. The role of government - Look behind us. The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents. First, life and liberty. We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none. I do not believe in cutting our military. I believe in maintaining the strength of America\u2019s military. Second, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country. That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose. I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can\u2019t care for themselves are cared by \u2014 by one another. We\u2019re a nation that believes that we\u2019re all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled. We care for them. And we \u2014 we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens. But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals. And what we\u2019re seeing right now is, in my view, a \u2014 a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams. And it\u2019s not working. And the proof of that is 23 million people out of work. The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty. The proof of that is we\u2019ve gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps. The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can\u2019t find work."}

That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support. Let me just say one final example. When it comes to making college affordable, whether it\u2019s two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed. So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system. And we said, \u201cWhy not cut out the middleman?\u201d And as a consequence, what we\u2019ve been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans. And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference. Governor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that, you know, \u201cyou should borrow money from your parents to go to college,\u201d you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver, just don\u2019t have that option.

The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective? How do we get schools to be more competitive? Let\u2019s grade them.

That\u2019s how we cut taxes for middle- class families and small businesses. That\u2019s how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasn\u2019t advancing that cause.

And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she\u2019s gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn\u2019t lay off workers during a recession. The auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride, that they\u2019re helping to build America. And so the question now is how do we build on those strengths.

I\u2019m concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years. I \u2014 I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals. It\u2019s bigger than our respective parties. It\u2019s an election about the course of America. What kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children. And there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening, and over the course of this month we\u2019re going to have two more presidential debates and a vice presidential debate. We\u2019re talk about those two paths. But they lead in very different directions. And it\u2019s not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of where they go. You can look at the record. There\u2019s no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected you\u2019ll continue to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up. I\u2019ll get incomes up again. You\u2019ll see chronic unemployment. We\u2019ve had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent. If I\u2019m president I will create \u2014 help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes. If the president\u2019s reelected, Obamacare will be fully installed. In my view that\u2019s going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past. Many will lose it. You\u2019re going to see health premiums go up by some $2,500 per family. If I\u2019m elected we won\u2019t have Obama. We\u2019ll put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and we\u2019ll focus on getting the cost of health care down. If the president were to be reelected you\u2019re going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare. You\u2019ll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare Advantage. You\u2019ll have hospital and providers that\u2019ll no longer accept Medicare patients. I\u2019ll restore that $716 billion to Medicare. And finally, military. The president\u2019s reelected you\u2019ll see dramatic cuts to our military. The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating. I will not cut our commitment to our military.

Now they have enough for five. They\u2019re racing toward a nuclear weapon. They\u2019re four years closer toward a nuclear weapons capability. We\u2019ve had four different sanctions, the U.N. on Iran, three from the Bush administration, one here.

In Congress, I\u2019ve been fighting for these sanctions since 2009. The administration was blocking us every step of the way.

When this administration says that all options are on the table, they send out senior administration officials that send all these mixed signals. And so, in order to solve this peacefully \u2014 which is everybody\u2019s goal \u2014 you have to have the ayatollahs change their minds. Look at where they are.

Absolutely. But we\u2019re going in the wrong direction. Look at where we are. The economy is barely limping along. It\u2019s growing a 1.3 percent. That\u2019s slower than it grew last year and last year was slower than the year before. Job growth in September was slower than it was in August, and August was slower than it was in July. We\u2019re heading in the wrong direction; 23 million Americans are struggling for work today; 15 percent of Americans are living in poverty today. This is not what a real recovery looks like. We need real reforms for real recovery and that\u2019s exactly what Mitt Romney and I are proposing. It\u2019s a five-point plan. Get America energy independent in North America by the end of the decade. Help people who are hurting get the skills they need to get the jobs they want. Get this deficit and debt under control to prevent a debt crisis. Make trade work for America so we can make more things in America and sell them overseas, and champion small businesses. Don\u2019t raise taxes on small businesses because they\u2019re our job creators. He talks about Detroit. Mitt Romney\u2019s a car guy. They keep misquoting him, but let me tell you about the Mitt Romney I know. This is a guy who I was talking to a family in Northborough, Massachusetts the other day, Sheryl and Mark Nixon. Their kids were hit in a car crash, four of them. Two of them, Rob and Reed, were paralyzed. The Romneys didn\u2019t know them. They went to the same church; they never met before. Mitt asked if he could come over on Christmas. He brought his boys, his wife, and gifts. Later on, he said, \u201cI know you\u2019re struggling, Mark. Don\u2019t worry about their college. I\u2019ll pay for it.\u201d When Mark told me this story, because, you know what, Mitt Romney doesn\u2019t tell these stories. The Nixons told this story. When he told me this story, he said it wasn\u2019t the help, the cash help. It\u2019s that he gave his time, and he has consistently. This is a man who gave 30 percent of his income to charity, more than the two of us combined. Mitt Romney\u2019s a good man. He cares about 100 percent of Americans in this country. And with respect to that quote, I think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words don\u2019t come out of your mouth the right way."}

Medicare and Social Security are going bankrupt. These are indisputable facts. Look, when I look at these programs, we\u2019ve all had tragedies in our lives. I think about what they\u2019ve done for my own family. My mom and I had my grandmother move in with us who was facing Alzheimer\u2019s. Medicare was there for here, just like it\u2019s there for my mom right now who is a Florida senior. After my dad died, my mom and I got Social Security survivors benefits, helped me pay for college, it helped her go back to college in her 50s where she started a small business because of the new skills she got. She paid all of her taxes on the promise that these programs would be there for her. We will honor this promise. And the best way to do it is reform it for my generation. You see, if you reform these programs for my generation, people 54 and below, you can guarantee they don\u2019t change for people in or near retirement, which is precisely what Mitt Romney and I are proposing. Look what \u2014 look what Obamacare does. Obamacare takes $716 billion from Medicare to spend on Obamacare. Even their own chief actuary at Medicare backs this up. He says you can\u2019t spend the same dollar twice. You can\u2019t claim that this money goes to Medicare and Obamacare. And then they put this new Obamacare board in charge of cutting Medicare each and every year in ways that will lead to denied care for current seniors. This board, by the way, it\u2019s 15 people, the president\u2019s supposed to appoint them next year. And not one of them even has to have medical training. And Social Security? If we don\u2019t shore up Social Security, when we run out of the IOUs, when the program goes bankrupt, a 25 percent across-the-board benefit cut kicks in on current seniors in the middle of their retirement. We\u2019re going to stop that from happening. They haven\u2019t put a credible solution on the table. He\u2019ll tell you about vouchers. He\u2019ll say all these things to try and scare people. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re saying: give younger people, when they become Medicare eligible, guaranteed coverage options that you can\u2019t be denied, including traditional Medicare. Choose your plan, and then Medicare subsidizes your premiums, not as much for the wealthy people, more coverage for middle-income people, and total out-of-pocket coverage for the poor and the sick. Choice and competition. We would rather have 50 million future seniors determine how their Medicare is delivered to them instead of 15 bureaucrats deciding what, if, when, where they get it."}

And the president and I are not going to rest until that playing field is leveled, they, in fact, have a clear shot, and they have peace of mind, until they can turn to their kid and say with a degree of confidence, \u201cHoney, it\u2019s going to be OK. It\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d That\u2019s what this is all about. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan?"}

President Obama, he had his chance. He made his choices. His economic agenda, more spending, more borrowing, higher taxes, a government takeover of health care. It\u2019s not working. It\u2019s failed to create the jobs we need. Twenty-three million Americans are struggling for work today. Fifteen percent of Americans are in poverty. This is not what a real recovery looks like. You deserve better. Mitt Romney and I want to earn your support. We\u2019re offering real reforms for a real recovery for every American. Mitt Romney \u2014 his experience, his ideas, his solutions \u2014 is uniquely qualified to get this job done. At a time when we have a jobs crisis in America, wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have a job-creator in the White House? The choice is clear - a stagnant economy that promotes more government dependency or a dynamic, growing economy that promotes opportunity and jobs. Mitt Romney and I will not duck the tough issues, and we will not blame others for the next four years. We will take responsibility. And we will not try to replace our founding principles. We will reapply our founding principles. The choice is clear, and the choice rests with you. And we ask you for your vote. Thank you."}

Thank you to Hofstra University and to Candy Crowley for organizing and leading this \u2014 this event. Thank you, Mr. President, also for being part of this \u2014 this debate. Your question \u2014 your question is one that\u2019s being asked by college kids all over this country. I was in Pennsylvania with someone who had just graduated \u2014 this was in Philadelphia \u2014 and she said, \u201cI\u2019ve got my degree. I can\u2019t find a job. I\u2019ve got three part- time jobs. They\u2019re just barely enough to pay for my food and pay for an apartment. I can\u2019t begin to pay back my student loans.\u201d So what we have to do is two things. We have to make sure that we make it easier for kids to afford college. And also make sure that when they get out of college, there\u2019s a job. When I was governor of Massachusetts, to get a high school degree, you had to pass an exam. If you graduated in the top quarter of your airlines, we gave you a John and Abigail Adams scholarship, four years tuition free in the college of your choice in Massachusetts, it\u2019s a public institution. I want to make sure we keep our Pell grant program growing. We\u2019re also going to have our loan program, so that people are able to afford school. But the key thing is to make sure you can get a job when you get out of school. And what\u2019s happened over the last four years has been very, very hard for America\u2019s young people. I want you to be able to get a job. I know what it takes to get this economy going. With half of college kids graduating this year without a college \u2014 excuse me, without a job. And without a college level job, that\u2019s just unacceptable. And likewise you\u2019ve got more and more debt on your back. So more debt and less jobs. I\u2019m going to change that. I know what it takes to create good jobs again. I know what it takes to make sure that you have the kind of opportunity you deserve. And kids across this country are going to recognize, we\u2019re bringing back an economy. It\u2019s not going to be like the last four years. The middle-class has been crushed over the last four years, and jobs have been too scarce. I know what it takes to bring them back, and I\u2019m going to do that, and make sure that when you graduate \u2014 when do you graduate?"}

And the fact that you\u2019re making an investment in higher education is critical. Not just to you, but to the entire nation. Now, the most important thing we can do is to make sure that we are creating jobs in this country. But not just jobs, good paying jobs. Ones that can support a family. And what I want to do, is build on the five million jobs that we\u2019ve created over the last 30 months in the private sector alone. And there are a bunch of things we can do to make sure your future is bright. Number one, I want to build manufacturing jobs in this country again. Now when Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt. I said we\u2019re going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry and it\u2019s come surging back. I want to do that in industries, not just in Detroit, but all across the country and that means we change our tax code so we\u2019re giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the United States and creating jobs here. It also means we\u2019re helping them and small businesses to export all around the world to new markets. Number two, we\u2019ve got to make sure that we have the best education system in the world. And the fact that you\u2019re going to college is great, but I want everybody to get a great education and we\u2019ve worked hard to make sure that student loans are available for folks like you, but I also want to make sure that community colleges are offering slots for workers to get retrained for the jobs that are out there right now and the jobs of the future. Number three, we\u2019ve got to control our own energy. Now, not only oil and natural gas, which we\u2019ve been investing in; but also, we\u2019ve got to make sure we\u2019re building the energy source of the future, not just thinking about next year, but ten years from now, 20 years from now. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve invested in solar and wind and biofuels, energy efficient cars. We\u2019ve got to reduce our deficit, but we\u2019ve got to do it in a balanced way. Asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more along with cuts so that we can invest in education like yours. And let\u2019s take the money that we\u2019ve been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild America, roads, bridges schools. We do those things, not only is your future going to be bright but America\u2019s future is going to bright as well."}

He said when I took office, the price of gasoline was $1.80, $1.86. Why is that? Because the economy was on the verge of collapse, because we were about to go through the worst recession since the Great Depression, as a consequence of some of the same policies that Governor Romney\u2019s now promoting. So, it\u2019s conceivable that Governor Romney could bring down gas prices because with his policies, we might be back in that same mess. What I want to do is to create an economy that is strong, and at the same time produce energy. And with respect to this pipeline that Governor Romney keeps on talking about, we\u2019ve \u2014 we\u2019ve built enough pipeline to wrap around the entire earth once. So, I\u2019m all for pipelines. I\u2019m all for oil production. What I\u2019m not for is us ignoring the other half of the equation. So, for example, on wind energy, when Governor Romney says \u201cthese are imaginary jobs.\u201d When you\u2019ve got thousands of people right now in Iowa, right now in Colorado, who are working, creating wind power with good-paying manufacturing jobs, and the Republican senator in that \u2014 in Iowa is all for it, providing tax breaks (ph) to help this work and Governor Romney says I\u2019m opposed.

And that is, I want to give middle-class families and folks who are striving to get into the middle-class some relief. Because they have been hit hard over the last decade. Over the last 15, over the last 20 years. So four years ago I stood on a stage just like this one. Actually it was a town hall, and I said I would cut taxes for middle- class families, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done, by $3,600.00. I said I would cut taxes for small businesses, who are the drivers and engines of growth. And we\u2019ve cut them 18 times. And I want to continue those tax cuts for middle-class families, and for small business. But what I\u2019ve also said is, if we\u2019re serious about reducing the deficit, if this is genuinely a moral obligation to the next generation, then in addition to some tough spending cuts, we\u2019ve also got to make sure that the wealthy do a little bit more. So what I\u2019ve said is, your first $250,000.00 worth of income, no change. And that means 98 percent of American families, 97 percent of small businesses, they will not see a tax increase. I\u2019m ready to sign that bill right now. The only reason it\u2019s not happening is because Governor Romney\u2019s allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent. But what I\u2019ve also says is for above $250,000, we can go back to the tax rates we had when Bill Clinton was president. We created 23 million new jobs. That\u2019s part of what took us from deficits to surplus. It will be good for our economy and it will be good for job creation. Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy. He was on 60 Minutes just two weeks ago and he was asked - Is it fair for somebody like you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody making $50,000 year? And he said, \u201cYes, I think that\u2019s fair.\u201d Not only that, he said, \u201cI think that\u2019s what grows the economy.\u201d Well, I fundamentally disagree with that. I think what grows the economy is when you get that tax credit that we put in place for your kids going to college. I think that grows the economy. I think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country. That grows our economy. So we just have a different theory. And when Governor Romney stands here, after a year of campaigning, when during a Republican primary he stood on stage and said \u201cI\u2019m going to give tax cuts\u201d \u2014 he didn\u2019t say tax rate cuts, he said \u201ctax cuts to everybody,\u201d including the top 1 percent, you should believe him because that\u2019s been his history. And that\u2019s exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that\u2019s striving for everybody."}

And, you know, I was raised by a single mom who had to put herself through school while looking after two kids. And she worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we got everything we needed. My grandmother, she started off as a secretary in a bank. She never got a college education, even though she was smart as a whip. And she worked her way up to become a vice president of a local bank, but she hit the glass ceiling. She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career. She didn\u2019t complain. That\u2019s not what you did in that generation. And this is one of the reasons why one of the first \u2014 the first bill I signed was something called the Lily Ledbetter bill. And it\u2019s named after this amazing woman who had been doing the same job as a man for years, found out that she was getting paid less, and the Supreme Court said that she couldn\u2019t bring suit because she should have found about it earlier, whereas she had no way of finding out about it. So we fixed that. And that\u2019s an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family. This is not just a women\u2019s issue, this is a family issue, this is a middle-class issue, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to fight for it. It also means that we\u2019ve got to make sure that young people like yourself are able to afford a college education. Earlier, Governor Romney talked about he wants to make Pell Grants and other education accessible for young people. Well, the truth of the matter is, is that that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve expanded Pell Grants for millions of people, including millions of young women, all across the country. We did it by taking $60 billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, and we said, let\u2019s just cut out the middleman. Let\u2019s give the money directly to students. And as a consequence, we\u2019ve seen millions of young people be able to afford college, and that\u2019s going to make sure that young women are going to be able to compete in that marketplace. But we\u2019ve got to enforce the laws, which is what we are doing, and we\u2019ve also got to make sure that in every walk of life we do not tolerate discrimination. That\u2019s been one of the hallmarks of my administration. I\u2019m going to continue to push on this issue for the next four years."}

And important topic, and one which I learned a great deal about, particularly as I was serving as governor of my state, because I had the chance to pull together a cabinet and all the applicants seemed to be men. And I \u2014 and I went to my staff, and I said, \u201cHow come all the people for these jobs are \u2014 are all men.\u201d They said, \u201cWell, these are the people that have the qualifications.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, gosh, can\u2019t we \u2014 can\u2019t we find some \u2014 some women that are also qualified?\u201d And \u2014 and so we \u2014 we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet. I went to a number of women\u2019s groups and said, \u201cCan you help us find folks,\u201d and they brought us whole binders full of women. I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America. Now one of the reasons I was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort. But number two, because I recognized that if you\u2019re going to have women in the workforce that sometimes you need to be more flexible. My chief of staff, for instance, had two kids that were still in school. She said, I can\u2019t be here until 7 or 8 o\u2019clock at night. I need to be able to get home at 5 o\u2019clock so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school. So we said fine. Let\u2019s have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you. We\u2019re going to have to have employers in the new economy, in the economy I\u2019m going to bring to play, that are going to be so anxious to get good workers they\u2019re going to be anxious to hire women. In the \u2014 in the last women have lost 580,000 jobs. That\u2019s the net of what\u2019s happened in the last four years. We\u2019re still down 580,000 jobs. I mentioned 31\/2 million women, more now in poverty than four years ago. What we can do to help young women and women of all ages is to have a strong economy, so strong that employers that are looking to find good employees and bringing them into their workforce and adapting to a flexible work schedule that gives women opportunities that they would otherwise not be able to afford. This is what I have done. It\u2019s what I look forward to doing and I know what it takes to make an economy work, and I know what a working economy looks like. And an economy with 7.8 percent unemployment is not a real strong economy. An economy that has 23 million people looking for work is not a strong economy. An economy with 50 percent of kids graduating from college that can\u2019t finds a job, or a college level job, that\u2019s not what we have to have. CROWLEY: Governor? I\u2019m going to help women in America get good work by getting a stronger economy and by supporting women in the workforce."}

President Bush and I are \u2014 are different people and these are different times and that\u2019s why my five point plan is so different than what he would have done. I mean for instance, we can now, by virtue of new technology actually get all the energy we need in North America without having to go to the \u2014 the Arabs or the Venezuelans or anyone else. That wasn\u2019t true in his time, that\u2019s why my policy starts with a very robust policy to get all that energy in North America \u2014 become energy secure. Number two, trade \u2014 I\u2019ll crack down on China, President Bush didn\u2019t. I\u2019m also going to dramatically expand trade in Latin America. It\u2019s been growing about 12 percent per year over a long period of time. I want to add more free trade agreements so we\u2019ll have more trade. Number three, I\u2019m going to get us to a balanced budget. President Bush didn\u2019t. President Obama was right, he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years. He was right, but then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four years. And his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large. So that\u2019s the next area I\u2019m different than President Bush. And then let\u2019s take the last one, championing small business. Our party has been focused too long. I came through small business. I understand how hard it is to start a small business. That\u2019s why everything I\u2019ll do is designed to help small businesses grow and add jobs. I want to keep their taxes down on small business. I want regulators to see their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it. And the thing I find the most troubling about Obama Care, well it\u2019s a long list, but one of the things I find most troubling is that when you go out and talk to small businesses and ask them what they think about it, they tell you it keeps them from hiring more people. My priority is jobs. I know how to make that happen. And President Bush has a very different path for a very different time. My path is designed in getting small businesses to grow and hire people."}

I said we\u2019d refocus attention on those who actually attacked us on 9\/11, and we have gone after Al Qaeda\u2019s leadership like never before and Osama bin Laden is dead. I said that we would put in place health care reform to make sure that insurance companies can\u2019t jerk you around and if you don\u2019t have health insurance, that you\u2019d have a chance to get affordable insurance, and I have. I committed that I would rein in the excesses of Wall Street, and we passed the toughest Wall Street reforms since the 1930s. We\u2019ve created five million jobs, and gone from 800 jobs a month being lost, and we are making progress. We saved an auto industry that was on the brink of collapse. Now, does that mean you\u2019re not struggling? Absolutely not. A lot of us are. And that\u2019s why the plan that I\u2019ve put forward for manufacturing and education, and reducing our deficit in a sensible way, using the savings from ending wars, to rebuild America and putting people back to work. Making sure that we are controlling our own energy, but not only the energy of today, but also the energy of the future.

I think you know that these last four years haven\u2019t been so good as the president just described and that you don\u2019t feel like your confident that the next four years are going to be much better either. I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what you\u2019re going to get. You\u2019re going to get a repeat of the last four years. We just can\u2019t afford four more years like the last four years. He said that by now we\u2019d have unemployment at 5.4 percent. The difference between where it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million Americans without work. I wasn\u2019t the one that said 5.4 percent. This was the president\u2019s plan. Didn\u2019t get there. He said he would have by now put forward a plan to reform Medicare and Social Security, because he pointed out they\u2019re on the road to bankruptcy. He would reform them. He\u2019d get that done. He hasn\u2019t even made a proposal on either one. He said in his first year he\u2019d put out an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges. Didn\u2019t even file it. This is a president who has not been able to do what he said he\u2019d do. He said that he\u2019d cut in half the deficit. He hasn\u2019t done that either. In fact, he doubled it. He said that by now middle-income families would have a reduction in their health insurance premiums by $2,500 a year. It\u2019s gone up by $2,500 a year. And if Obamacare is passed, or implemented \u2014 it\u2019s already been passed \u2014 if it\u2019s implemented fully, it\u2019ll be another $2,500 on top. The middle class is getting crushed under the policies of a president who has not understood what it takes to get the economy working again. He keeps saying, \u201cLook, I\u2019ve created 5 million jobs.\u201d That\u2019s after losing 5 million jobs. The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country. The unemployment, the number of people who are still looking for work, is still 23 million Americans. There are more people in poverty, one out of six people in poverty. How about food stamps? When he took office, 32 million people were on food stamps. Today, 47 million people are on food stamps. How about the growth of the economy? It\u2019s growing more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before. The president wants to do well. I understand. But the policies he\u2019s put in place from Obamacare to Dodd-Frank to his tax policies to his regulatory policies, these policies combined have not let this economy take off and grow like it could have. You might say, \u201cWell, you got an example of one that worked better?\u201d Yeah, in the Reagan recession where unemployment hit 10.8 percent, between that period \u2014 the end of that recession and the equivalent of time to today, Ronald Reagan\u2019s recovery created twice as many jobs as this president\u2019s recovery. Five million jobs doesn\u2019t even keep up with our population growth. And the only reason the unemployment rate seems a little lower today is because of all the people that have dropped out of the workforce. The president has tried, but his policies haven\u2019t worked. He\u2019s great as a \u2014 as a \u2014 as a speaker and describing his plans and his vision. That\u2019s wonderful, except we have a record to look at. And that record shows he just hasn\u2019t been able to cut the deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare and Social Security to preserve them, to get us the rising incomes we need. Median income is down $4,300 a family and 23 million Americans out of work. That\u2019s what this election is about. It\u2019s about who can get the middle class in this country a bright and prosperous future and assure our kids the kind of hope and optimism they deserve."}

And let me step back and tell you what I would like to do with our immigration policy broadly and include an answer to your question. But first of all, this is a nation of immigrants. We welcome people coming to this country as immigrants. My dad was born in Mexico of American parents; Ann\u2019s dad was born in Wales and is a first-generation American. We welcome legal immigrants into this country. I want our legal system to work better. I want it to be streamlined. I want it to be clearer. I don\u2019t think you have to \u2014 shouldn\u2019t have to hire a lawyer to figure out how to get into this country legally. I also think that we should give visas to people \u2014 green cards, rather, to people who graduate with skills that we need. People around the world with accredited degrees in science and math get a green card stapled to their diploma, come to the U.S. of A. We should make sure our legal system works. Number two, we\u2019re going to have to stop illegal immigration. There are 4 million people who are waiting in line to get here legally. Those who\u2019ve come here illegally take their place. So I will not grant amnesty to those who have come here illegally. What I will do is I\u2019ll put in place an employment verification system and make sure that employers that hire people who have come here illegally are sanctioned for doing so. I won\u2019t put in place magnets for people coming here illegally. So for instance, I would not give driver\u2019s licenses to those that have come here illegally as the president would. The kids of those that came here illegally, those kids, I think, should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United States and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident. Now when the president ran for office, he said that he\u2019d put in place, in his first year, a piece of legislation \u2014 he\u2019d file a bill in his first year that would reform our \u2014 our immigration system, protect legal immigration, stop illegal immigration. He didn\u2019t do it. He had a Democrat House, a Democrat Senate, super majority in both Houses. Why did he fail to even promote legislation that would have provided an answer for those that want to come legally and for those that are here illegally today? What\u2019s a question I think the \u2014 the president will have a chance to answer right now."}

Was \u2014 Lorranna \u2014 Lorraine \u2014 we are a nation of immigrants. I mean we\u2019re just a few miles away from Ellis Island. We all understand what this country has become because talent from all around the world wants to come here. People are willing to take risks. People who want to build on their dreams and make sure their kids have an even bigger dreams than they have. But we\u2019re also a nation of laws. So what I\u2019ve said is we need to fix a broken immigration system and I\u2019ve done everything that I can on my own and sought cooperation from Congress to make sure that we fix the system. The first thing we did was to streamline the legal immigration system, to reduce the backlog, make it easier, simpler and cheaper for people who are waiting in line, obeying the law to make sure that they can come here and contribute to our country and that\u2019s good for our economic growth. They\u2019ll start new businesses. They\u2019ll make things happen to create jobs here in the United States. Number two, we do have to deal with our border so we put more border patrol on the \u2014 any time in history and the flow of undocumented works across the border is actually lower than it\u2019s been in 40 years. What I\u2019ve also said is if we\u2019re going to go after folks who are here illegally, we should do it smartly and go after folks who are criminals, gang bangers, people who are hurting the community, not after students, not after folks who are here just because they\u2019re trying to figure out how to feed their families. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. And what I\u2019ve also said is for young people who come here, brought here often times by their parents. Had gone to school here, pledged allegiance to the flag. Think of this as their country. Understand themselves as Americans in every way except having papers. And we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done administratively. Now, Governor Romney just said, you know he wants to help those young people too, but during the Republican primary, he said, \u201cI will veto the DREAM Act\u201d, that would allow these young people to have access.\u201d His main strategy during the Republican primary was to say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to encourage self-deportation.\u201d Making life so miserable on folks that they\u2019ll leave. He called the Arizona law a model for the nation. Part of the Arizona law said that law enforcement officers could stop folks because they suspected maybe they looked like they might be undocumented workers and check their papers. You know what? If my daughter or yours looks to somebody like they\u2019re not a citizen, I don\u2019t want \u2014 I don\u2019t want to empower somebody like that. So, we can fix this system in a comprehensive way. And when Governor Romney says, the challenge is, \u201cWell Obama didn\u2019t try.\u201d That\u2019s not true. I have sat down with Democrats and Republicans at the beginning of my term. And I said, let\u2019s fix this system. Including Senators previously who had supported it on the Republican side. But it\u2019s very hard for Republican\u2019s in Congress to support comprehensive immigration reform, if their standard bearer has said that, this is not something I\u2019m interested in supporting."}

We\u2019ve got a long tradition of hunting and sportsmen and people who want to make sure they can protect themselves. But there have been too many instances during the course of my presidency, where I\u2019ve had to comfort families who have lost somebody. Most recently out in Aurora. You know, just a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably about a month, I saw a mother, who I had met at the bedside of her son, who had been shot in that theater. And her son had been shot through the head. And we spent some time, and we said a prayer and, remarkably, about two months later, this young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable, good as new. But there were a lot of families who didn\u2019t have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands didn\u2019t survive. So my belief is that, (A), we have to enforce the laws we\u2019ve already got, make sure that we\u2019re keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill. We\u2019ve done a much better job in terms of background checks, but we\u2019ve got more to do when it comes to enforcement. But I also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters don\u2019t belong on our streets. And so what I\u2019m trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally. Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced. But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence. Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there\u2019s an awful lot of violence and they\u2019re not using AK-47s. They\u2019re using cheap hand guns. And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that our schools are working; that if there\u2019s violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control. And so what I want is a \u2014 is a comprehensive strategy. Part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. But part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur."}

We, of course, don\u2019t want to have automatic weapons, and that\u2019s already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons. What I believe is we have to do, as the president mentioned towards the end of his remarks there, which is to make enormous efforts to enforce the gun laws that we have, and to change the culture of violence that we have. And you ask how \u2014 how are we going to do that? And there are a number of things. He mentioned good schools. I totally agree. We were able to drive our schools to be number one in the nation in my state. And I believe if we do a better job in education, we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll give people the \u2014 the hope and opportunity they deserve and perhaps less violence from that. But let me mention another thing. And that is parents. We need moms and dads, helping to raise kids. Wherever possible the \u2014 the benefit of having two parents in the home, and that\u2019s not always possible. A lot of great single moms, single dads. But gosh to tell our kids that before they have babies, they ought to think about getting married to someone, that\u2019s a great idea. Because if there\u2019s a two parent family, the prospect of living in poverty goes down dramatically. The opportunities that the child will \u2014 will be able to achieve increase dramatically. So we can make changes in the way our culture works to help bring people away from violence and give them opportunity, and bring them in the American system. The \u2014 the greatest failure we\u2019ve had with regards to \u2014 to gun violence in some respects is what \u2014 what is known as Fast and Furious. Which was a program under this administration, and how it worked exactly I think we don\u2019t know precisely, where thousands of automatic, and AK-47 type weapons were \u2014 were given to people that ultimately gave them to \u2014 to drug lords. They used those weapons against \u2014 against their own citizens and killed Americans with them. And this was a \u2014 this was a program of the government. For what purpose it was put in place, I can\u2019t imagine. But it\u2019s one of the great tragedies related to violence in our society which has occurred during this administration. Which I think the American people would like to understand fully, it\u2019s been investigated to a degree, but \u2014 but the administration has carried out executive privilege to prevent all of the information from coming out. I\u2019d like to understand who it was that did this, what the idea was behind it, why it led to the violence, thousands of guns going to Mexican drug lords. OBAMA: Candy?"}

But I think that one area we agree on is the important of parents and the importance of schools, because I do believe that if our young people have opportunity, then they are less likely to engage in these kinds of violent acts. We\u2019re not going to eliminate everybody who is mentally disturbed and we have got to make sure they don\u2019t get weapons. But we can make a difference in terms ensuring that every young person in America, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, have a chance to succeed. And, Candy, we haven\u2019t had a chance to talk about education much, but I think it is very important to understand that the reforms we\u2019ve put in place, working with 46 governors around the country, are seeing schools that are some of the ones that are the toughest for kids starting to succeed. We\u2019re starting to see gains in math and science. When it comes to community colleges, we are setting up programs, including with Nassau Community College, to retrain workers, including young people who may have dropped out of school but now are getting another chance, training them for the jobs that exist right now. And in fact, employers are looking for skilled workers. And so we\u2019re matching them up. Giving them access to higher education.

In the course of that, I think the president\u2019s campaign has tried to characterize me as \u2014 as someone who\u2019s very different than who I am. I care about 100 percent of the American people. I want 100 percent of the American people to have a bright and prosperous future. I care about our kids.

And I believe we\u2019re all children of the same God. I believe we have a responsibility to care for one another. I \u2014 I served as a missionary for my church. I served as a pastor in my congregation for about 10 years. I\u2019ve sat across the table from people who were out of work and worked with them to try and find new work or to help them through tough times. I went to the Olympics when they were in trouble to try and get them on track.

I was able also to get our schools ranked number one in the nation, so 100 percent of our kids would have a bright opportunity for a future. I understand that I can get this country on track again. We don\u2019t have to settle for what we\u2019re going through. We don\u2019t have to settle for gasoline at four bucks. We don\u2019t have to settle for unemployment at a chronically high level. We don\u2019t have to settle for 47 million people on food stamps. We don\u2019t have to settle for 50 percent of kids coming out of college not able to get work.

Folks on Social Security who\u2019ve worked all their lives. Veterans who\u2019ve sacrificed for this country.

And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done over the last four years. We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on those who actually killed us on 9\/11. And as a consequence, Al Qaeda\u2019s core leadership has been decimated. In addition, we\u2019re now able to transition out of Afghanistan in a responsible way, making sure that Afghans take responsibility for their own security. And that allows us also to rebuild alliances and make friends around the world to combat future threats. Now with respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last debate, when we received that phone call, I immediately made sure that, number one, that we did everything we could to secure those Americans who were still in harm\u2019s way; number two, that we would investigate exactly what happened, and number three, most importantly, that we would go after those who killed Americans and we would bring them to justice.

Keep in mind that I and Americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to, without putting troops on the ground at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in Iraq, liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years. Got rid of a despot who had killed Americans and as a consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of Libyans after the events in Benghazi marching and saying America is our friend. We stand with them. Now that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of. And, you know, Governor Romney, I\u2019m glad that you agree that we have been successful in going after Al Qaida, but I have to tell you that, you know, your strategy previously has been one that has been all over the map and is not designed to keep Americans safe or to build on the opportunities that exist in the Middle East."}

But the key that we\u2019re going to have to pursue is a \u2014 is a pathway to get the Muslim world to be able to reject extremism on its own. We don\u2019t want another Iraq, we don\u2019t want another Afghanistan. That\u2019s not the right course for us. The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the \u2014 the people who are leaders of these various anti-American groups and these \u2014 these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world. And how do we do that? A group of Arab scholars came together, organized by the U.N., to look at how we can help the \u2014 the world reject these \u2014 these terrorists. And the answer they came up with was this: One, more economic development. We should key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investment, and that of our friends, we should coordinate it to make sure that we \u2014 we push back and give them more economic development. Number two, better education. Number three, gender equality. Number four, the rule of law. We have to help these nations create civil societies. But what\u2019s been happening over the last couple of years is, as we\u2019ve watched this tumult in the Middle East, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see Al Qaida rushing in, you see other jihadist groups rushing in. And \u2014 and they\u2019re throughout many nations in the Middle East. It\u2019s wonderful that Libya seems to be making some progress, despite this terrible tragedy. But next door, of course, we have Egypt. Libya\u2019s 6 million population; Egypt, 80 million population. We want \u2014 we want to make sure that we\u2019re seeing progress throughout the Middle East. With Mali now having North Mali taken over by Al Qaida; with Syria having Assad continuing to \u2014 to kill, to murder his own people, this is a region in tumult.

First of all, 30,000 people being killed by their government is a humanitarian disaster. Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly right now. Syria is Iran\u2019s only ally in the Arab world. It\u2019s their route to the sea. It\u2019s the route for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally, Israel. And so seeing Syria remove Assad is a very high priority for us. Number two, seeing a \u2014 a replacement government being responsible people is critical for us. And finally, we don\u2019t want to have military involvement there. We don\u2019t want to get drawn into a military conflict. And so the right course for us, is working through our partners and with our own resources, to identify responsible parties within Syria, organize them, bring them together in a \u2014 in a form of \u2014 if not government, a form of \u2014 of \u2014 of council that can take the lead in Syria. And then make sure they have the arms necessary to defend themselves. We do need to make sure that they don\u2019t have arms that get into the \u2014 the wrong hands. Those arms could be used to hurt us down the road. We need to make sure as well that we coordinate this effort with our allies, and particularly with \u2014 with Israel. But the Saudi\u2019s and the Qatari, and \u2014 and the Turks are all very concerned about this. They\u2019re willing to work with us. We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria, making sure that the \u2014 the insurgent there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed, are people who will be the responsible parties. Recognize \u2014 I believe that Assad must go. I believe he will go. But I believe \u2014 we want to make sure that we have the relationships of friendship with the people that take his place, steps that in the years to come we see Syria as a \u2014 as a friend, and Syria as a responsible party in the Middle East. This \u2014 this is a critical opportunity for America. And what I\u2019m afraid of is we\u2019ve watched over the past year or so, first the president saying, well we\u2019ll let the U.N. deal with it. And Assad \u2014 excuse me, Kofi Annan came in and said we\u2019re going to try to have a ceasefire. That didn\u2019t work. Then it went to the Russians and said, let\u2019s see if you can do something. We should be playing the leadership role there, not on the ground with military."}

This is a time \u2014 this should have been a time for American leadership.

As you hear from intelligence sources even today, the \u2014 the insurgents are highly disparate. They haven\u2019t come together. They haven\u2019t formed a unity group, a council of some kind.

The notion that we would have tanks run over those young people who were in Tahrir Square, that is not the kind of American leadership that John F. Kennedy talked about 50 years ago. But what I\u2019ve also said is that now that you have a democratically elected government in Egypt, that they have to make sure that they take responsibility for protecting religious minorities. And we have put significant pressure on them to make sure they\u2019re doing that; to recognize the rights of women, which is critical throughout the region. These countries can\u2019t develop if young women are not given the kind of education that they need. They have to abide by their treaty with Israel. That is a red line for us, because not only is Israel\u2019s security at stake, but our security is at stake if that unravels. They have to make sure that they\u2019re cooperating with us when it comes to counterterrorism. And we will help them with respect to developing their own economy, because ultimately what\u2019s going to make the Egyptian revolution successful for the people of Egypt, but also for the world, is if those young people who gathered there are seeing opportunities. Their aspirations are similar to young people\u2019s here. They want jobs, they want to be able to make sure their kids are going to a good school. They want to make sure that they have a roof over their heads and that they have the prospects of a better life in the future. And so one of the things that we\u2019ve been doing is, is, for example, organizing entrepreneurship conferences with these Egyptians to give them a sense of how they can start rebuilding their economy in a way that\u2019s noncorrupt, that\u2019s transparent. But what is also important for us to understand is, is that for America to be successful in this region there\u2019s some things that we\u2019re going to have to do here at home as well. You know, one of the challenges over the last decade is we\u2019ve done experiments in nation building in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and we\u2019ve neglected, for example, developing our own economy, our own energy sectors, our own education system. And it\u2019s very hard for us to project leadership around the world when we\u2019re not doing what we need to do\u2026"}

And those principles include human rights, human dignity, free enterprise, freedom of expression, elections. Because when there are elections, people tend to vote for peace. They don\u2019t vote for war. So we want to promote those principles around the world. We recognize that there are places of conflict in the world. We want to end those conflicts to the extent humanly possible. But in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong. America must lead. And for that to happen, we have to strengthen our economy here at home. You can\u2019t have 23 million people struggling to get a job. You can\u2019t have an economy that over the last three years keeps slowing down its growth rate. You can\u2019t have kids coming out of college, half of them can\u2019t find a job today, or a job that\u2019s commensurate with their college degree. We have to get our economy going. And our military, we\u2019ve got to strengthen our military long-term. We don\u2019t know what the world is going to throw at us down the road. We \u2014 we make decisions today in the military that \u2014 that will confront challenges we can\u2019t imagine. In the 2000 debates, there was no mention of terrorism, for instance. And a year later, 9\/11 happened. So, we have to make decisions based upon uncertainty, and that means a strong military. I will not cut our military budget. We have to also stand by our allies. I \u2014 I think the tension that existed between Israel and the United States was very unfortunate. I think also that pulling our missile defense program out of Poland in the way we did was also unfortunate in terms of, if you will, disrupting the relationship in some ways that existed between us. And then, of course, with regards to standing for our principles, when \u2014 when the students took to the streets in Tehran and the people there protested, the Green Revolution occurred, for the president to be silent I thought was an enormous mistake. We have to stand for our principles, stand for our allies, stand for a strong military and stand for a stronger economy."}

And the world needs a strong America, and it is stronger now than when I came into office. Because we ended the war in Iraq, we were able to refocus our attention on not only the terrorist threat, but also beginning a transition process in Afghanistan. It also allowed us to refocus on alliances and relationships that had been neglected for a decade. And Governor Romney, our alliances have never been stronger, in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel, where we have unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation, including dealing with the Iranian threat. But what we also have been able to do is position ourselves so we can start rebuilding America, and that\u2019s what my plan does. Making sure that we\u2019re bringing manufacturing back to our shores so that we\u2019re creating jobs here, as we\u2019ve done with the auto industry, not rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas. Making sure that we\u2019ve got the best education system in the world, including retraining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow. Doing everything we can to control our own energy. We\u2019ve cut our oil imports to the lowest level in two decades because we\u2019ve developed oil and natural gas. But we also have to develop clean energy technologies that will allow us to cut our exports in half by 2020. That\u2019s the kind of leadership that we need to show. And we\u2019ve got to make sure that we reduce our deficit. Unfortunately, Governor Romney\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t do it. We\u2019ve got to do it in a responsible way by cutting out spending we don\u2019t need, but also asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more. That way we can invest in the research and technology that\u2019s always kept us at the cutting edge. Now, Governor Romney has taken a different approach throughout this campaign. Both at home and abroad, he has proposed wrong and reckless policies. He\u2019s praised George Bush as a good economic steward and Dick Cheney as somebody who\u2019s \u2014 who shows great wisdom and judgment.

We\u2019re 9 million jobs short of that. I will get America working again and see rising take-home pay again, and I\u2019ll do it with five simple steps. Number one, we are going to have North American energy independence. We\u2019re going to do it by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear and our renewables. Number two, we\u2019re going to increase our trade. Trade grows about 12 percent year. It doubles about every \u2014 every five or so years. We can do better than that, particularly in Latin America. The opportunities for us in Latin America we have just not taken advantage of fully. As a matter of fact, Latin America\u2019s economy is almost as big as the economy of China. We\u2019re all focused on China. Latin America is a huge opportunity for us \u2014 time zone, language opportunities. Number three, we\u2019re going to have to have training programs that work for our workers and schools that finally put the parents and the teachers and the kids first, and the teachers\u2019 unions going to have to go behind. And then we\u2019re going to have to get to a balanced budget. We can\u2019t expect entrepreneurs and businesses large and small to take their life savings or their company\u2019s money and invest in America if they think we\u2019re headed to the road to Greece. And that\u2019s where we\u2019re going right now unless we finally get off this spending and borrowing binge. And I\u2019ll get us on track to a balanced budget. And finally, number five, we\u2019ve got to champion small business. Small business is where jobs come from. Two-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses. New business formation is down to the lowest level in 30 years under this administration. I want to bring it back and get back good jobs and rising take-home pay."}

First of all, Governor Romney talks about small businesses. But, Governor, when you were in Massachusetts, small businesses development ranked about 48th, I think out of 50 states in Massachusetts, because the policies that you are promoting actually don\u2019t help small businesses. And the way you define small businesses includes folks at the very top. And they include you and me. That\u2019s not the kind of small business promotion we need. But let\u2019s take an example that we know is going to make a difference in the 21st century and that\u2019s our education policy. We didn\u2019t have a lot of chance to talk about this in the last debate. You know, under my leadership, what we\u2019ve done is reformed education, working with governors, 46 states. We\u2019ve seen progress and gains in schools that were having a terrible time. And they\u2019re starting to finally make progress. And what I now want to do is to hire more teachers, especially in math and science, because we know that we\u2019ve fallen behind when it comes to math and science. And those teachers can make a difference. Now, Governor Romney, when you were asked by teachers whether or not this would help the economy grow, you said this isn\u2019t going to help the economy grow. When you were asked about reduced class sizes, you said class sizes don\u2019t make a difference. But I tell you, if you talk to teachers, they will tell you it does make a difference. And if we\u2019ve got math teachers who are able to provide the kind of support that they need for our kids, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to determine whether or not the new businesses are created here. Companies are going to locate here depending on whether we\u2019ve got the most highly skilled workforce. And the kinds of budget proposals that you\u2019ve put forward, when we don\u2019t ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for education, that\u2019s undermining our long-term competitiveness.

In fact, this week we\u2019ll be carrying out the largest military exercise with Israel in history, this very week. But to the issue of Iran, as long as I\u2019m president of the United States Iran will not get a nuclear weapon. I made that clear when I came into office. We then organized the strongest coalition and the strongest sanctions against Iran in history, and it is crippling their economy. Their currency has dropped 80 percent. Their oil production has plunged to the lowest level since they were fighting a war with Iraq 20 years ago. So their economy is in a shambles. And the reason we did this is because a nuclear Iran is a threat to our national security, and it is a threat to Israel\u2019s national security. We cannot afford to have a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world. Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism. And for them to be able to provide nuclear technology to non-state actors, that\u2019s unacceptable. And they have said that they want to see Israel wiped off the map. So the work that we\u2019ve done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice. They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a United States president, me, who said we\u2019re not going to take any options off the table. The disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that, during the course of this campaign, he\u2019s often talked as if we should take premature military action. I think that would be a mistake, because when I\u2019ve sent young men and women into harm\u2019s way, I always understand that that is the last resort, not the first resort."}

If we\u2019re going to talk about trips that we\u2019ve taken \u2014 when I was a candidate for office, first trip I took was to visit our troops. And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn\u2019t take donors. I didn\u2019t attend fundraisers. I went to Yad Beshef (ph), the Holocaust museum there, to remind myself the nature of evil and why our bond with Israel will be unbreakable. And then I went down to the border towns of Storok (ph), which had experienced missiles raining dowm from Hamas. And I saw families there who showed me there where missiles had come down near their children\u2019s bedrooms. And I was reminded of what that would mean if those were my kids. Which is why as president, we funded an Iron Dome program to stop those missiles. So that\u2019s how I\u2019ve used my travels, when I travel to Israel and when I travel to the region. And the \u2014 the central question at this point is going to be: Who is going to be credible to all parties involved?

I mean, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear program. But just a few years ago you said that\u2019s something you\u2019d never do. In the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in Afghanistan, now you\u2019re for it, although it depends. In the same way that you say you would have ended the war in Iraq, but recently gave a speech saying that we should have 20,000 more folks in there. The same way that you said that it was mission creep to go after Gadhafi. When it comes to going after Osama bin Laden, you said, well, any president would make that call. But when you were a candidate in 2008, as I was, and I said if I got bin Laden in our sights I would take that shot, you said we shouldn\u2019t move heaven and earth to get one man. And you said we should ask Pakistan for permission. And if we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him. And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him. You know, after we killed bin Laden I was at ground zero for a memorial and talked to a young women who was four years old when 9\/11 happened. And the last conversation she had with her father was him calling from the twin towers, saying \u201cPeyton (ph), I love you and I will always watch over you.\u201d And for the next decade, she was haunted by that conversation. And she said to me, \u201cYou know, by finally getting bin Laden, that brought some closure to me.\u201d And when we do things like that \u2014 when we bring those who have harmed us to justice, that sends a message to the world and it tells Peyton (ph) that we did not forget her father. And I make that point because that\u2019s the kind of clarity of leadership, and those decisions are not always popular. Those decisions generally \u2014 generally are not poll-tested. And even some in my own party, including my current vice president, had the same critique as you did. But what the American people understand is that I look at what we need to get done to keep the American people safe and to move our interests forward, and I make those decisions."}

We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on Afghanistan, and we did deliver a surge of troops. That was facilitated in part because we had ended the war in Iraq. And we are now in a position where we have met many of the objectives that got us there in the first place. Part of what had happened is we\u2019d forgotten why we had gone. We went because there were people who were responsible for 3,000 American deaths. And so we decimated Al Qaida\u2019s core leadership in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan. We then started to build up Afghan forces. And we\u2019re now in a position where we can transition out, because there\u2019s no reason why Americans should die when Afghans are perfectly capable of defending their own country. Now, that transition has to take place in a responsible fashion. We\u2019ve been there a long time, and we\u2019ve got to make sure that we and our coalition partners are pulling out responsibly and giving Afghans the capabilities that they need. But what I think the American people recognize is after a decade of war it\u2019s time to do some nation building here at home. And what we can now do is free up some resources, to, for example, put Americans back to work, especially our veterans, rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our schools, making sure that, you know, our veterans are getting the care that they need when it comes to post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, making sure that the certifications that they need for good jobs of the future are in place. You know, I was having lunch with some \u2014 a veteran in Minnesota who had been a medic dealing with the most extreme circumstances. When he came home and he wanted to become a nurse, he had to start from scratch. And what we\u2019ve said is let\u2019s change those certifications. The first lady has done great work with an organization called Joining Forces putting our veterans back to work. And as a consequence, veterans\u2019 unemployment is actually now lower than general population. It was higher when I came into office. So those are the kinds of things that we can now do because we\u2019re making that transition in Afghanistan."}

So across the board, we are engaging them in building capacity in these countries. And we have stood on the side of democracy. One thing I think Americans should be proud of, when Tunisians began to protest, this nation \u2014 me, my administration \u2014 stood with them earlier than just about any country. In Egypt we stood on the side of democracy. In Libya we stood on the side of the people. And as a consequence, there\u2019s no doubt that attitudes about Americans have changed. But there are always going to be elements in these countries that potentially threaten the United States. And we want to shrink those groups and those networks and we can do that. But we\u2019re always also going to have to maintain vigilance when it comes to terrorist activities. The truth, though, is that Al Qaeda is much weaker than it was when I came into office.

We have to remain vigilant, as I just said. But with respect to China, China is both an adversary, but also a potential partner in the international community if it\u2019s following the rules. So my attitude coming into office was that we are going to insist that China plays by the same rules as everybody else. I know Americans had seen jobs being shipped overseas; businesses and workers not getting a level playing field when it came to trade. And that\u2019s the reason why I set up a trade task force to go after cheaters when it came to international trade. That\u2019s the reason why we have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the other \u2014 the previous administration had done in two terms. And we\u2019ve won just about every case that we\u2019ve filed, that has been decided. In fact, just recently steelworkers in Ohio and throughout the Midwest \u2014 Pennsylvania \u2014 are in a position now to sell steel to China because we won that case. We had a tire case in which they were flooding us with cheap domestic tires \u2014 or \u2014 or cheap Chinese tires. And we put a stop to it and as a consequence saved jobs throughout America. I have to say that Governor Romney criticized me for being too tough in that tire case; said this wouldn\u2019t be good for American workers and that it would be protectionist. But I tell you, those workers don\u2019t feel that way. They feel as if they had finally an administration who was going to take this issue seriously. Over the long term, in order for us to compete with China, we\u2019ve also got to make sure, though, that we\u2019re taking \u2014 taking care of business here at home. If we don\u2019t have the best education system in the world, if we don\u2019t continue to put money into research and technology that will allow us to create great businesses here in the United States, that\u2019s how we lose the competition. And, unfortunately, Governor Romney\u2019s budget and his proposals would not allow us to make those investments."}

And, you know, that\u2019s \u2014 you\u2019re right. I mean that\u2019s how our free market works. But I\u2019ve made a different bet on American workers. If we had taken your advice Governor Romney about our auto industry, we\u2019d be buying cars from China instead of selling cars to China. If we take your advice with respect to how we change our tax codes so that companies that earn profits overseas don\u2019t pay U.S. taxes compared to companies here that are paying taxes. Now that\u2019s estimated to create 800,000 jobs, the problem is they won\u2019t be here, they\u2019ll be in places like China. And if we\u2019re not making investments in education and basic research, which is not something that the private sector is doing at a sufficient pace right now and has never done, then we will lose the (inaudible) in things like clean energy technology. Now with respect to what we\u2019ve done with China already, U.S. exports have doubled since I came into office, to China and actually currencies are at their most advantageous point for U.S. exporters since 1993. We absolutely have to make more progress and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to keep on pressing. And when it comes to our military and Chinese security, part of the reason that we were able to pivot to the Asia-Pacific region after having ended the war in Iraq and transitioning out of Afghanistan, is precisely because this is going to be a massive growth area in the future. And we believe China can be a partner, but we\u2019re also sending a very clear signal that America is a Pacific power; that we are going to have a presence there. We are working with countries in the region to make sure, for example, that ships can pass through; that commerce continues. And we\u2019re organizing trade relations with countries other than China so that China starts feeling more pressure about meeting basic international standards.

The president\u2019s path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay. I want to make sure our take-home pay turns around and starts to grow. The president\u2019s path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay. I want to make sure take-home pay turns around and starts to grow.

America\u2019s going to come back, and for that to happen, we\u2019re going to have to have a president who can work across the aisle. I was in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat. I learned how to get along on the other side of the aisle. We\u2019ve got to do that in Washington. Washington is broken.

We need strong leadership. I\u2019d like to be that leader with your support. I\u2019ll work with you. I\u2019ll lead you in an open and honest way, and I ask for your vote. I\u2019d like to be the next president of the United States to support and help this great nation and to make sure that we all together remain America as the hope of the earth. Thank you so much."}

I can\u2019t think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country. You know, we are at a defining moment in our history. Our nation is involved in two wars, and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And although we\u2019ve heard a lot about Wall Street, those of you on Main Street I think have been struggling for a while, and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy. And you\u2019re wondering, how\u2019s it going to affect me? How\u2019s it going to affect my job? How\u2019s it going to affect my house? How\u2019s it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college? So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely. And I\u2019ve put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort. Number one, we\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019ve got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money. Number two, we\u2019ve got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market \u2014 and when the market returns. Number three, we\u2019ve got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes. And, number four, we\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country. Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down. It hasn\u2019t worked. And I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for president, and that\u2019s what I hope we\u2019re going to be talking about tonight."}

And, Jim, I \u2014 I\u2019ve been not feeling too great about a lot of things lately. So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges. But I\u2019m feeling a little better tonight, and I\u2019ll tell you why. Because as we\u2019re here tonight in this debate, we are seeing, for the first time in a long time, Republicans and Democrats together, sitting down, trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that we\u2019re in. And have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis. And we\u2019re not talking about failure of institutions on Wall Street. We\u2019re talking about failures on Main Street, and people who will lose their jobs, and their credits, and their homes, if we don\u2019t fix the greatest fiscal crisis, probably in \u2014 certainly in our time, and I\u2019ve been around a little while. But the point is \u2014 the point is, we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package. This package has transparency in it. It has to have accountability and oversight. It has to have options for loans to failing businesses, rather than the government taking over those loans. We have to \u2014 it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it. And, yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives. And they weren\u2019t part of the negotiations, and I understand that. And it was the House Republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem. But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight. This isn\u2019t the beginning of the end of this crisis. This is the end of the beginning, if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable. And we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do. And we\u2019ve got to create jobs. And one of the areas, of course, is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil."}

The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place? Two years ago, I warned that, because of the subprime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time. Last year, I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it. So \u2014 so the question, I think, that we\u2019ve got to ask ourselves is, yes, we\u2019ve got to solve this problem short term. And we are going to have to intervene; there\u2019s no doubt about that. But we\u2019re also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations? We did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems. And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad."}

President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters. One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever. And he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy. Somehow we\u2019ve lost that accountability. I\u2019ve been heavily criticized because I called for the resignation of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We\u2019ve got to start also holding people accountable, and we\u2019ve got to reward people who succeed. But somehow in Washington today \u2014 and I\u2019m afraid on Wall Street \u2014 greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption \u2014 or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded. As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration. And I promise you that that will happen."}

And he\u2019s also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn\u2019t the case with me. But let\u2019s be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year\u2019s budget. Senator McCain is proposing \u2014 and this is a fundamental difference between us \u2014 $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion. Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important. And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out. So my attitude is, we\u2019ve got to grow the economy from the bottom up. What I\u2019ve called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent. And that means that the ordinary American out there who\u2019s collecting a paycheck every day, they\u2019ve got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them. And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the \u2014 the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to \u2014 wants to follow."}

Right now, in the United States of America, business pays the second-highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent. Ireland pays 11 percent. Now, if you\u2019re a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where it\u2019s 11 percent tax versus 35 percent, you\u2019re going to be able to create jobs, increase your business, make more investment, et cetera. I want to cut that business tax. I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in \u2014 in the United States of America and create jobs. But, again, I want to return. It\u2019s a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending. I can tell you, it\u2019s rife. It\u2019s throughout. The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000 \u2014 2,000 \u2014 look at them, my friends. Look at them. You\u2019ll be appalled. And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects. So the point is, I want people to have tax cuts. I want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care. I want to double the dividend from $3,500 to $7,000 for every dependent child in America. I know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody, and a lot of people might be interested in Senator Obama\u2019s definition of \u201crich.\u201d"}

And if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dime\u2019s worth of tax increase. Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and he\u2019s absolutely right. Here\u2019s the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world. And what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more. It\u2019s not like you want to close the loopholes. You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes. And that\u2019s a problem. Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5,000 health credit. Now, what he doesn\u2019t tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits. So you may end up getting a $5,000 tax credit. Here\u2019s the only problem: Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that you\u2019re getting from your employer. And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, you\u2019ve got to go out on the open market and try to buy it. It is not a good deal for the American people. But it\u2019s an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off we\u2019re going to be."}

We don\u2019t yet know what our tax revenues are going to be. The economy is slowing down, so it\u2019s hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year. But there\u2019s no doubt that we\u2019re not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done. There are some things that I think have to be done. We have to have energy independence, so I\u2019ve put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years\u2019 time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on Middle Eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy, solar, wind, biodiesel, making sure that we\u2019re developing the fuel-efficient cars of the future right here in the United States, in Ohio and Michigan, instead of Japan and South Korea. We have to fix our health care system, which is putting an enormous burden on families. Just \u2014 a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families. They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care. I\u2019m meeting folks all over the country. We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off. The third thing we have to do is we\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re competing in education. We\u2019ve got to invest in science and technology. China had a space launch and a space walk. We\u2019ve got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science. And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America. And I also think that we\u2019re going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities. Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them. So there are some \u2014 some things that we\u2019ve got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy. We can\u2019t shortchange those things. We\u2019ve got to eliminate programs that don\u2019t work, and we\u2019ve got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less."}

It\u2019s hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left. The point \u2014 the point is \u2014 the point is, we need to examine every agency of government. First of all, by the way, I\u2019d eliminate ethanol subsidies. I oppose ethanol subsidies. I think that we have to return \u2014 particularly in defense spending, which is the largest part of our appropriations \u2014 we have to do away with cost-plus contracts. We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control. We tried to build a little ship called the Littoral Combat Ship that was supposed to cost $140 million, ended up costing $400 million, and we still haven\u2019t done it. So we need to have fixed-cost contracts. We need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control. I know how to do that. I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong. And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this because I\u2019ve been involved these issues for many, many years. But I think that we have to examine every agency of government and find out those that are doing their job and keep them and find out those that aren\u2019t and eliminate them and we\u2019ll have to scrub every agency of government."}

Now six years ago, I stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world, and whether our intelligence was sound, but also because we hadn\u2019t finished the job in Afghanistan. We hadn\u2019t caught bin Laden. We hadn\u2019t put al Qaeda to rest, and as a consequence, I thought that it was going to be a distraction. Now Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment. And I wish I had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right, but that\u2019s not the case. We\u2019ve spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion. We have lost over 4,000 lives. We have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001. We took our eye off the ball. And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government. So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and I will not, as president, in order to keep the American people safe. But we have to use our military wisely. And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq."}

Now, I think that\u2019s the right strategy; I think that\u2019s the right policy. And, John, I \u2014 you\u2019re absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say. But, you know, coming from you, who, you know, in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and, you know, sung songs about bombing Iran, I don\u2019t know, you know, how credible that is.

And we\u2019ve got a choice. We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions. And the problem, John, with the strategy that\u2019s been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled Musharraf, we alienated the Pakistani population, because we were anti-democratic. We had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, \u201cWell, you know, he may be a dictator, but he\u2019s our dictator.\u201d And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan. We spent $10 billion. And in the meantime, they weren\u2019t going after Al Qaida, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan.

Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state. But let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing Iran and all that, let me tell you my record. Back in 1983, when I was a brand-new United States congressman, the one \u2014 the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon. And I saw that, and I saw the situation, and I stood up, and I voted against that, because I was afraid that they couldn\u2019t make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference. Tragically, I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks. And then we had Somalia \u2014 then we had the first Gulf War. I supported \u2014 I supported that. I supported us going into Bosnia, when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in Bosnia. That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe. I supported what we did in Kosovo. I supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there. And I have a record \u2014 and Somalia, I opposed that we should turn \u2014 turn the force in Somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of. So I have a record. I have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harm\u2019s way. And I\u2019ll tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, \u201cSenator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son\u2019s name on it.\u201d He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad, Matthew Stanley, before Christmas last year. This was last August, a year ago. And I said, \u201cI will \u2014 I will wear his bracelet with honor.\u201d And this was August, a year ago. And then she said, \u201cBut, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything \u2014 promise me one thing, that you\u2019ll do everything in your power to make sure that my son\u2019s death was not in vain.\u201d That means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re-enlisted in Baghdad, just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed. And they all say to me that we don\u2019t want defeat. I know what that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like when an army is defeated. A war that I was in, where we had an Army, that it wasn\u2019t through any fault of their own, but they were defeated. And I know how hard it is for that \u2014 for an Army and a military to recover from that. And it did and we will win this one and we won\u2019t come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail."}

Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust. Let\u2019s just make that very clear. What I have proposed for a long time, and I\u2019ve had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, let\u2019s be clear and let\u2019s have some straight talk. The Russians are preventing significant action in the United Nations Security Council. I have proposed a league of democracies, a group of people \u2013 a group of countries that share common interests, common values, common ideals, they also control a lot of the world\u2019s economic power. We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect. The Iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues. So I am convinced that together, we can, with the French, with the British, with the Germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect Iranian behavior. But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight. And it is a threat not only in this region but around the world. What I\u2019d also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans, there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran. There is the Republican Guard in Iran, which Senator Kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror. Senator Obama said that would be provocative. So this is a serious threat. This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons."}

But after 9\/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9\/11, and find out what happened, and fix it. And we were \u2014 we were opposed by the administration, another area where I differed with this administration.

I think it\u2019s neither the best or worst of Washington, but it\u2019s evidence of the fact that the economic policies of the last eight years have been the worst economic policies we\u2019ve ever had. As a consequence, you\u2019ve seen what\u2019s happened on Wall Street. If you need any more proof positive of how bad the economic theories have been, this excessive deregulation, the failure to oversee what was going on, letting Wall Street run wild, I don\u2019t think you needed any more evidence than what you see now. So the Congress has been put \u2014 Democrats and Republicans have been put in a very difficult spot. But Barack Obama laid out four basic criteria for any kind of rescue plan here. He, first of all, said there has to be oversight. We\u2019re not going to write any check to anybody unless there\u2019s oversight for the \u2014 of the secretary of Treasury. He secondly said you have to focus on homeowners and folks on Main Street. Thirdly, he said that you have to treat the taxpayers like investors in this case. And, lastly, what you have to do is make sure that CEOs don\u2019t benefit from this, because this could end up, in the long run, people making money off of this rescue plan. And so, as a consequence of that, it brings us back to maybe the fundamental disagreement between Governor Palin and me and Senator McCain and Barack Obama, and that is that the \u2014 we\u2019re going to fundamentally change the focus of the economic policy. We\u2019re going to focus on the middle class, because it\u2019s \u2014 when the middle class is growing, the economy grows and everybody does well, not just focus on the wealthy and corporate America."}

You know, I think a good barometer here, as we try to figure out has this been a good time or a bad time in America\u2019s economy, is go to a kid\u2019s soccer game on Saturday, and turn to any parent there on the sideline and ask them, \u201cHow are you feeling about the economy?\u201d And I\u2019ll bet you, you\u2019re going to hear some fear in that parent\u2019s voice, fear regarding the few investments that some of us have in the stock market. Did we just take a major hit with those investments? Fear about, how are we going to afford to send our kids to college? A fear, as small-business owners, perhaps, how we\u2019re going to borrow any money to increase inventory or hire more people. The barometer there, I think, is going to be resounding that our economy is hurting and the federal government has not provided the sound oversight that we need and that we deserve, and we need reform to that end. Now, John McCain thankfully has been one representing reform. Two years ago, remember, it was John McCain who pushed so hard with the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reform measures. He sounded that warning bell. People in the Senate with him, his colleagues, didn\u2019t want to listen to him and wouldn\u2019t go towards that reform that was needed then. I think that the alarm has been heard, though, and there will be that greater oversight, again thanks to John McCain\u2019s bipartisan efforts that he was so instrumental in bringing folks together over this past week, even suspending his own campaign to make sure he was putting excessive politics aside and putting the country first."}

And while Barack Obama was talking about reinstating those regulations, John on 20 different occasions in the previous year and a half called for more deregulation. As a matter of fact, John recently wrote an article in a major magazine saying that he wants to do for the health care industry deregulate it and let the free market move like he did for the banking industry. So deregulation was the promise. And guess what? Those people who say don\u2019t go into debt, they can barely pay to fill up their gas tank.

We can speak in agreement here that darn right we need tax relief for Americans so that jobs can be created here. Now, Barack Obama and Senator Biden also voted for the largest tax increases in U.S. history. Barack had 94 opportunities to side on the people\u2019s side and reduce taxes and 94 times he voted to increase taxes or not support a tax reduction, 94 times. Now, that\u2019s not what we need to create jobs and really bolster and heat up our economy. We do need the private sector to be able to keep more of what we earn and produce. Government is going to have to learn to be more efficient and live with less if that\u2019s what it takes to reign in the government growth that we\u2019ve seen today. But we do need tax relief and Barack Obama even supported increasing taxes as late as last year for those families making only $42,000 a year. That\u2019s a lot of middle income average American families to increase taxes on them. I think that is the way to kill jobs and to continue to harm our economy."}

With regard to the role of vice president, I had a long talk, as I\u2019m sure the governor did with her principal, in my case with Barack. And let me tell you what Barack asked me to do. I have a history of getting things done in the United States Senate. John McCain would acknowledge that. My record shows that on controversial issues. I would be the point person for the legislative initiatives in the United States Congress for our administration. I would also, when asked if I wanted a portfolio, my response was, no. But Barack Obama indicated to me he wanted me with him to help him govern. So every major decision he\u2019ll be making, I\u2019ll be sitting in the room to give him my best advice. He\u2019s president, not me, I\u2019ll give my best advice. And one of the things he said early on when he was choosing, he said he picked someone who had an independent judgment and wouldn\u2019t be afraid to tell him if he disagreed. That is sort of my reputation, as you know. So I look forward to working with Barack and playing a very constructive role in his presidency, bringing about the kind of change this country needs."}

About times and Todd and our marriage in our past where we didn\u2019t have health insurance and we know what other Americans are going through as they sit around the kitchen table and try to figure out, how are they going to pay out-of-pocket for health care? We\u2019ve been there also so that connection was important. But even more important is that worldview that I share with John McCain. That worldview that says that America is a nation of exceptionalism. And we are to be that shining city on a hill, as President Reagan so beautifully said, that we are a beacon of hope and that we are unapologetic here. We are not perfect as a nation. But together, we represent a perfect ideal, and that is democracy and tolerance and freedom and equal rights.

I want to first, obviously, thank Belmont University, Tom, thank you, and to all of you who are participating tonight and those of you who sent e-mail questions in. I think everybody knows now we are in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And a lot of you I think are worried about your jobs, your pensions, your retirement accounts, your ability to send your child or your grandchild to college. And I believe this is a final verdict on the failed economic policies of the last eight years, strongly promoted by President Bush and supported by Senator McCain, that essentially said that we should strip away regulations, consumer protections, let the market run wild, and prosperity would rain down on all of us. It hasn\u2019t worked out that way. And so now we\u2019ve got to take some decisive action. Now, step one was a rescue package that was passed last week. We\u2019ve got to make sure that works properly. And that means strong oversight, making sure that investors, taxpayers are getting their money back and treated as investors. It means that we are cracking down on CEOs and making sure that they\u2019re not getting bonuses or golden parachutes as a consequence of this package. And, in fact, we just found out that AIG, a company that got a bailout, just a week after they got help went on a $400,000 junket. And I\u2019ll tell you what, the Treasury should demand that money back and those executives should be fired. But that\u2019s only step one. The middle-class need a rescue package. And that means tax cuts for the middle-class. It means help for homeowners so that they can stay in their homes. It means that we are helping state and local governments set up road projects and bridge projects that keep people in their jobs. And then long-term we\u2019ve got to fix our health care system, we\u2019ve got to fix our energy system that is putting such an enormous burden on families. You need somebody working for you and you\u2019ve got to have somebody in Washington who is thinking about the middle class and not just those who can afford to hire lobbyists."}

Prosperity is not just going to trickle down. We\u2019ve got to help the middle class. And we\u2019ve \u2014 you know, Senator McCain and I have some fundamental disagreements on the economy, starting with Senator McCain\u2019s statement earlier that he thought the fundamentals of the economy were sound. Part of the problem here is that for many of you, wages and incomes have flat-lined. For many of you, it is getting harder and harder to save, harder and harder to retire. And that\u2019s why, for example, on tax policy, what I want to do is provide a middle class tax cut to 95 percent of working Americans, those who are working two jobs, people who are not spending enough time with their kids, because they are struggling to make ends meet. Senator McCain is right that we\u2019ve got to stabilize housing prices. But underlying that is loss of jobs and loss of income.

If less money is coming in, you end up making cuts. Maybe you don\u2019t go out to dinner as much. Maybe you put off buying a new car. That\u2019s not what happens in Washington. And you\u2019re right. There is a lot of blame to go around. But I think it\u2019s important just to remember a little bit of history. When George Bush came into office, we had surpluses. And now we have half-a-trillion-dollar deficit annually. When George Bush came into office, our debt \u2014 national debt was around $5 trillion. It\u2019s now over $10 trillion. We\u2019ve almost doubled it. And so while it\u2019s true that nobody\u2019s completely innocent here, we have had over the last eight years the biggest increases in deficit spending and national debt in our history. And Senator McCain voted for four out of five of those George Bush budgets. So here\u2019s what I would do. I\u2019m going to spend some money on the key issues that we\u2019ve got to work on. You know, you may have seen your health care premiums go up. We\u2019ve got to reform health care to help you and your budget. We are going to have to deal with energy because we can\u2019t keep on borrowing from the Chinese and sending money to Saudi Arabia. We are mortgaging our children\u2019s future. We\u2019ve got to have a different energy plan. We\u2019ve got to invest in college affordability. So we\u2019re going to have to make some investments, but we\u2019ve also got to make spending cuts. And what I\u2019ve proposed, you\u2019ll hear Senator McCain say, well, he\u2019s proposing a whole bunch of new spending, but actually I\u2019m cutting more than I\u2019m spending so that it will be a net spending cut. The key is whether or not we\u2019ve got priorities that are working for you as opposed to those who have been dictating the policy in Washington lately, and that\u2019s mostly lobbyists and special interests. We\u2019ve got to put an end to that."}

I have a clear record of bipartisanship. The situation today cries out for bipartisanship. Senator Obama has never taken on his leaders of his party on a single issue. And we need to reform. And so let\u2019s look at our records as well as our rhetoric. That\u2019s really part of your mistrust here. And now I suggest that maybe you go to some of these organizations that are the watchdogs of what we do, like the Citizens Against Government Waste or the National Taxpayers Union or these other organizations that watch us all the time. I don\u2019t expect you to watch every vote. And you know what you\u2019ll find? This is the most liberal big-spending record in the United States Senate. I have fought against excessive spending and outrages. I have fought to reduce the earmarks and eliminate them. Do you know that Senator Obama has voted for \u2014 is proposing $860 billion of new spending now? New spending. Do you know that he voted for every increase in spending that I saw come across the floor of the United States Senate while we were working to eliminate these pork barrel earmarks? He voted for nearly a billion dollars in pork barrel earmark projects, including, by the way, $3 million for an overhead projector at a planetarium in Chicago, Illinois. My friends, do we need to spend that kind of money? I think you have to look at my record and you have to look at his. Then you have to look at our proposals for our economy, not $860 billion in new spending, but for the kinds of reforms that keep people in their jobs, get middle-income Americans working again, and getting our economy moving again. You\u2019re going to be examining our proposals tonight and in the future, and energy independence is a way to do that, is one of them.

We\u2019ve got to show that we\u2019ve got good habits, because if we\u2019re running up trillion dollar debts that we\u2019re passing on to the next generation, then a lot of people are going to think, \u201cWell, you know what? There\u2019s easy money out there.\u201d It means \u2014 and I have to, again, repeat this. It means looking (ph) at the spending side, but also at the revenue side. I mean, Senator McCain has been talking tough about earmarks, and that\u2019s good, but earmarks account for about $18 billion of our budget. Now, when Senator McCain is proposing tax cuts that would give the average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts, that\u2019s not sharing a burden. And so part of the problem, I think, for a lot of people who are listening here tonight is they don\u2019t feel as if they are sharing the burden with other folks. I mean, you know, it\u2019s tough to ask a teacher who\u2019s making $30,000 or $35,000 a year to tighten her belt when people who are making much more than her are living pretty high on the hog. And that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s important for the president to set a tone that says all of us are going to contribute, all of us are going to make sacrifices, and it means that, yes, we may have to cut some spending, although I disagree with Senator McCain about an across-the- board freeze. That\u2019s an example of an unfair burden sharing. That\u2019s using a hatchet to cut the federal budget. I want to use a scalpel so that people who need help are getting help and those of us, like myself and Senator McCain, who don\u2019t need help, aren\u2019t getting it. That\u2019s how we make sure that everybody is willing to make a few sacrifices."}

We\u2019re going to have a lot of work to do, so I can\u2019t guarantee that we\u2019re going to do it in the next two years, but I\u2019d like to do in the my first term as president. But I think it\u2019s important to understand, we\u2019re not going to solve Social Security and Medicare unless we understand the rest of our tax policies. And you know, Senator McCain, I think the \u201cStraight Talk Express\u201d lost a wheel on that one. So let\u2019s be clear about my tax plan and Senator McCain\u2019s, because we\u2019re not going to be able to deal with entitlements unless we understand the revenues coming in. I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of Americans, 95 percent. If you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year, you will not see a single dime of your taxes go up. If you make $200,000 a year or less, your taxes will go down. Now, Senator McCain talks about small businesses. Only a few percent of small businesses make more than $250,000 a year. So the vast majority of small businesses would get a tax cut under my plan. And we provide a 50 percent tax credit so that they can buy health insurance for their workers, because there are an awful lot of small businesses that I meet across America that want to do right by their workers but they just can\u2019t afford it. Some small business owners, a lot of them, can\u2019t even afford health insurance for themselves. Now, in contrast, Senator McCain wants to give a $300 billion tax cut, $200 billion of it to the largest corporations and a hundred thousand of it \u2014 a hundred billion of it going to people like CEOs on Wall Street. He wants to give average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts. That is not fair. And it doesn\u2019t work. Now, if we get our tax policies right so that they\u2019re good for the middle class, if we reverse the policies of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place and that Senator McCain supported, then we are going to be in a position to deal with Social Security and deal with Medicare, because we will have a health care plan that actually works for you, reduces spending and costs over the long term, and Social Security that is stable and solvent for all Americans and not just some."}

I saw it done with our \u2014 our wonderful Ronald Reagan, a conservative from California, and the liberal Democrat Tip O\u2019Neill from Massachusetts. That\u2019s what we need more of, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done in Washington. Senator Obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue. I\u2019ve taken them on. I\u2019m not too popular sometimes with my own party, much less his. So Medicare, it\u2019s going to be a little tougher. It\u2019s going to be a little tougher because we\u2019re talking about very complex and difficult issues. My friends, what we have to do with Medicare is have a commission, have the smartest people in America come together, come up with recommendations, and then, like the base-closing commission idea we had, then we should have Congress vote up or down. Let\u2019s not let them fool with it anymore. There\u2019s too much special interests and too many lobbyists working there.

Senator Obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts. That\u2019s his record. When he ran for the United States Senate from Illinois, he said he would have a middle-income tax cut. You know he came to the Senate and never once proposed legislation to do that? So let\u2019s look at our record. I\u2019ve fought higher taxes. I have fought excess spending. I have fought to reform government. Let\u2019s look at our records, my friends, and then listen to my vision for the future of America. And we\u2019ll get our economy going again. And our best days are ahead of us."}

We can bridge the gap between imported oil, which is a national security issue, as well as any other, and it will reduce the price of a barrel of oil, because when people know there\u2019s a greater supply, then the cost of that will go down. That\u2019s fundamental economics. We\u2019ve got to drill offshore, my friends, and we\u2019ve got to do it now, and we can do it.

You really identified one of the really major challenges that America faces. Co-payments go up, costs go up, skyrocketing costs, which make people less and less able to afford health insurance in America. And we need to do all of the things that are necessary to make it more efficient. Let\u2019s put health records online, that will reduce medical errors, as they call them. Let\u2019s have community health centers. Let\u2019s have walk-in clinics. Let\u2019s do a lot of things to impose efficiencies. But what is at stake here in this health care issue is the fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama. As you notice, he starts talking about government. He starts saying, government will do this and government will do that, and then government will, and he\u2019ll impose mandates. If you\u2019re a small business person and you don\u2019t insure your employees, Senator Obama will fine you. Will fine you. That\u2019s remarkable. If you\u2019re a parent and you\u2019re struggling to get health insurance for your children, Senator Obama will fine you. I want to give every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit. They can take it anywhere, across state lines. Why not? Don\u2019t we go across state lines when we purchase other things in America? Of course it\u2019s OK to go across state lines because in Arizona they may offer a better plan that suits you best than it does here in Tennessee. And if you do the math, those people who have employer-based health benefits, if you put the tax on it and you have what\u2019s left over and you add $5,000 that you\u2019re going to get as a refundable tax credit, do the math, 95 percent of the American people will have increased funds to go out and buy the insurance of their choice and to shop around and to get \u2014 all of those people will be covered except for those who have these gold-plated Cadillac kinds of policies. You know, like hair transplants, I might need one of those myself. But the point is that we have got to give people choice in America and not mandate things on them and give them the ability. Every parent I know would acquire health insurance for their children if they could. Obviously small business people want to give their employees health insurance. Of course they all want to do that. We\u2019ve got to give them the wherewithal to do it. We can do it by giving them, as a start, a $5,000 refundable tax credit to go around and get the health insurance policy of their choice."}

So when genocide is happening, when ethnic cleansing is happening somewhere around the world and we stand idly by, that diminishes us. And so I do believe that we have to consider it as part of our interests, our national interests, in intervening where possible. But understand that there\u2019s a lot of cruelty around the world. We\u2019re not going to be able to be everywhere all the time. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for us to be able to work in concert with our allies. Let\u2019s take the example of Darfur just for a moment. Right now there\u2019s a peacekeeping force that has been set up and we have African Union troops in Darfur to stop a genocide that has killed hundreds of thousands of people. We could be providing logistical support, setting up a no-fly zone at relatively little cost to us, but we can only do it if we can help mobilize the international community and lead.

I think the realities are that both Russia and China would probably pose significant obstacles.

It\u2019s a threat to the stability of the entire Middle East. If Iran acquires nuclear weapons, all the other countries will acquire them, too. The tensions will be ratcheted up. What would you do if you were the Israelis and the president of a country says that they are \u2014 they are determined to wipe you off the map, calls your country a stinking corpse? Now, Senator Obama without precondition wants to sit down and negotiate with them, without preconditions. That\u2019s what he stated, again, a matter of record. I want to make sure that the Iranians are put enough \u2014 that we put enough pressure on the Iranians by joining with our allies, imposing significant, tough sanctions to modify their behavior. And I think we can do that. I think, joining with our allies and friends in a league of democracies, that we can effectively abridge their behavior, and hopefully they would abandon this quest that they are on for nuclear weapons. But, at the end of the day, my friend, I have to tell you again, and you know what it\u2019s like to serve, and you know what it\u2019s like to sacrifice, but we can never allow a second Holocaust to take place."}

We cannot allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon. It would be a game-changer in the region. Not only would it threaten Israel, our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world, but it would also create a possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists. And so it\u2019s unacceptable. And I will do everything that\u2019s required to prevent it. And we will never take military options off the table. And it is important that we don\u2019t provide veto power to the United Nations or anyone else in acting in our interests. It is important, though, for us to use all the tools at our disposal to prevent the scenario where we\u2019ve got to make those kinds of choices. And that\u2019s why I have consistently said that, if we can work more effectively with other countries diplomatically to tighten sanctions on Iran, if we can reduce our energy consumption through alternative energy, so that Iran has less money, if we can impose the kinds of sanctions that, say, for example, Iran right now imports gasoline, even though it\u2019s an oil-producer, because its oil infrastructure has broken down, if we can prevent them from importing the gasoline that they need and the refined petroleum products, that starts changing their cost-benefit analysis. That starts putting the squeeze on them. Now, it is true, though, that I believe that we should have direct talks \u2014 not just with our friends, but also with our enemies \u2014 to deliver a tough, direct message to Iran that, if you don\u2019t change your behavior, then there will be dire consequences. If you do change your behavior, then it is possible for you to re-join the community of nations. Now, it may not work. But one of the things we\u2019ve learned is, is that when we take that approach, whether it\u2019s in North Korea or in Iran, then we have a better chance at better outcomes. When President Bush decided we\u2019re not going to talk to Iran, we\u2019re not going to talk to North Korea, you know what happened? Iran went from zero centrifuges to develop nuclear weapons to 4,000. North Korea quadrupled its nuclear capability. We\u2019ve got to try to have talks, understanding that we\u2019re not taking military options off the table."}

It\u2019s the challenges that you don\u2019t that end up consuming most of your time. But here\u2019s what I do know. I know that I wouldn\u2019t be standing here if it weren\u2019t for the fact that this country gave me opportunity. I came from very modest means. I had a single mom and my grandparents raised me and it was because of the help of scholarships and my grandmother scrimping on things that she might have wanted to purchase and my mom, at one point, getting food stamps in order for us to put food on the table. Despite all that, I was able to go to the best schools on earth and I was able to succeed in a way that I could not have succeeded anywhere else in this country. The same is true for Michelle and I\u2019m sure the same is true for a lot of you. And the question in this election is - are we going to pass on that same American dream to the next generation? Over the last eight years, we\u2019ve seen that dream diminish. Wages and incomes have gone down. People have lost their health care or are going bankrupt because they get sick. We\u2019ve got young people who have got the grades and the will and the drive to go to college, but they just don\u2019t have the money. And we can\u2019t expect that if we do the same things that we\u2019ve been doing over the last eight years, that somehow we are going to have a different outcome. We need fundamental change. That\u2019s what\u2019s at stake in this election.

I think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And the financial rescue plan that Senator McCain and I supported is an important first step. And I pushed for some core principles - making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they\u2019re putting money up. Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process. And I think that it\u2019s going to take some time to work itself out. But what we haven\u2019t yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class. Because the fundamentals of the economy were weak even before this latest crisis. So I\u2019ve proposed four specific things that I think can help. Number one, let\u2019s focus on jobs. I want to end the tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and provide a tax credit for every company that\u2019s creating a job right here in America. Number two, let\u2019s help families right away by providing them a tax cut \u2014 a middle-class tax cut for people making less than $200,000, and let\u2019s allow them to access their IRA accounts without penalty if they\u2019re experiencing a crisis. Now Senator McCain and I agree with your idea that we\u2019ve got to help homeowners. That\u2019s why we included in the financial package a proposal to get homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate their mortgages. I disagree with Senator McCain in how to do it, because the way Senator McCain has designed his plan, it could be a giveaway to banks if we\u2019re buying full price for mortgages that now are worth a lot less. And we don\u2019t want to waste taxpayer money. And we\u2019ve got to get the financial package working much quicker than it has been working. Last point I want to make, though. We\u2019ve got some long-term challenges in this economy that have to be dealt with. We\u2019ve got to fix our energy policy that\u2019s giving our wealth away. We\u2019ve got to fix our health care system and we\u2019ve got to invest in our education system for every young person to be able to learn."}

And we both want to cut taxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes for. Now, Senator McCain, the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in America. Exxon Mobil, and other oil companies, for example, would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks. What I\u2019ve said is I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of working Americans, 95 percent. If you make more \u2014 if you make less than a quarter million dollars a year, then you will not see your income tax go up, your capital gains tax go up, your payroll tax. Not one dime. And 95 percent of working families, 95 percent of you out there, will get a tax cut. In fact, independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than Senator McCain does. Now, the conversation I had with Joe the plumber, what I essentially said to him was, \u201cFive years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then.\u201d And what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who doesn\u2019t yet have money, I want to give them a tax break now. And that requires us to make some important choices. The last point I\u2019ll make about small businesses. Not only do 98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000, but I also want to give them additional tax breaks, because they are the drivers of the economy. They produce the most jobs."}

So let me get to that. What I want to emphasize, though, is that I have been a strong proponent of pay-as- you-go. Every dollar that I\u2019ve proposed, I\u2019ve proposed an additional cut so that it matches. And some of the cuts, just to give you an example, we spend $15 billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies. It doesn\u2019t \u2014 under the Medicare plan \u2014 it doesn\u2019t help seniors get any better. It\u2019s not improving our health care system. It\u2019s just a giveaway. We need to eliminate a whole host of programs that don\u2019t work. And I want to go through the federal budget line by line, page by page, programs that don\u2019t work, we should cut. Programs that we need, we should make them work better. Now, what is true is that Senator McCain and I have a difference in terms of the need to invest in America and the American people. I mentioned health care earlier. If we make investments now so that people have coverage, that we are preventing diseases, that will save on Medicare and Medicaid in the future. If we invest in a serious energy policy, that will save in the amount of money we\u2019re borrowing from China to send to Saudi Arabia. If we invest now in our young people and their ability to go to college, that will allow them to drive this economy into the 21st century. But what is absolutely true is that, once we get through this economic crisis and some of the specific proposals to get us out of this slump, that we\u2019re not going to be able to go back to our profligate ways. And we\u2019re going to have to embrace a culture and an ethic of responsibility, all of us, corporations, the federal government, and individuals out there who may be living beyond their means."}

And I want to make sure that we are focused on those programs that work. Now, Senator McCain talks a lot about earmarks. That\u2019s one of the centerpieces of his campaign. Earmarks account for 0.5 percent of the total federal budget. There\u2019s no doubt that the system needs reform and there are a lot of screwy things that we end up spending money on, and they need to be eliminated. But it\u2019s not going to solve the problem. Now, the last thing I think we have to focus on is a little bit of history, just so that we understand what we\u2019re doing going forward. When President Bush came into office, we had a budget surplus and the national debt was a little over $5 trillion. It has doubled over the last eight years. And we are now looking at a deficit of well over half a trillion dollars. So one of the things that I think we have to recognize is pursuing the same kinds of policies that we pursued over the last eight years is not going to bring down the deficit. And, frankly, Senator McCain voted for four out of five of President Bush\u2019s budgets. We\u2019ve got to take this in a new direction, that\u2019s what I propose as president."}

Even FOX News disputes it, and that doesn\u2019t happen very often when it comes to accusations about me. So the fact of the matter is that if I occasionally have mistaken your policies for George Bush\u2019s policies, it\u2019s because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush.

What the American people can\u2019t afford, though, is four more years of failed economic policies. And what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about what\u2019s most pressing to them: the economic crisis. Senator McCain\u2019s own campaign said publicly last week that, if we keep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to change the subject.

In fact, Mr. Ayers has become the centerpiece of Senator McCain\u2019s campaign over the last two or three weeks. This has been their primary focus. So let\u2019s get the record straight. Bill Ayers is a professor of education in Chicago. Forty years ago, when I was 8 years old, he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group. I have roundly condemned those acts. Ten years ago he served and I served on a school reform board that was funded by one of Ronald Reagan\u2019s former ambassadors and close friends, Mr. Annenberg. Other members on that board were the presidents of the University of Illinois, the president of Northwestern University, who happens to be a Republican, the president of The Chicago Tribune, a Republican- leaning newspaper. Mr. Ayers is not involved in my campaign. He has never been involved in this campaign. And he will not advise me in the White House. So that\u2019s Mr. Ayers. Now, with respect to ACORN, ACORN is a community organization. Apparently what they\u2019ve done is they were paying people to go out and register folks, and apparently some of the people who were out there didn\u2019t really register people, they just filled out a bunch of names. It had nothing to do with us. We were not involved. The only involvement I\u2019ve had with ACORN was I represented them alongside the U.S. Justice Department in making Illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at DMVs. Now, the reason I think that it\u2019s important to just get these facts out is because the allegation that Senator McCain has continually made is that somehow my associations are troubling. Let me tell you who I associate with. On economic policy, I associate with Warren Buffett and former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker. If I\u2019m interested in figuring out my foreign policy, I associate myself with my running mate, Joe Biden or with Dick Lugar, the Republican ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, or General Jim Jones, the former supreme allied commander of NATO. Those are the people, Democrats and Republicans, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House. And I think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, Senator McCain, says more about your campaign than it says about me."}

It\u2019s not just that he has some of the best foreign policy credentials of anybody. And Democrats and Republicans alike, I think, acknowledge his expertise there. But it\u2019s also that his entire life he has never forgotten where he came from, coming from Scranton, fighting on behalf of working families, remembering what it\u2019s like to see his father lose his job and go through a downward spiral economically. And, as a consequence, his consistent pattern throughout his career is to fight for the little guy. That\u2019s what he\u2019s done when it comes to economic policies that will help working families get a leg up. That\u2019s what he\u2019s done when it comes to, for example, passing the landmark 1994 crime bill, the Violence Against Women\u2019s Act. Joe has always made sure that he is fighting on behalf of working families, and I think he shares my core values and my sense of where the country needs to go. Because after eight years of failed policies, he and I both agree that what we\u2019re going to have to do is to reprioritize, make sure that we\u2019re investing in the American people, give tax cuts not to the wealthiest corporations, but give them to small businesses and give them to individuals who are struggling right now, make sure that we finally get serious about energy independence, something that has been languishing in Washington for 30 years, and make sure that our kids get a great education and can afford to go to college. So, on the key issues that are of importance to American families, Joe Biden\u2019s always been on the right side, and I think he will make an outstanding president if, heaven forbid, something happened to me."}

Right now, because of previous agreements, some made by President Clinton, the goods and products that we send to Colombia, which is our largest agricultural importer of our products, is \u2014 there\u2019s a billion dollars that we \u2014 our businesses have paid so far in order to get our goods in there. Because of previous agreements, their goods and products come into our country for free. So Senator Obama, who has never traveled south of our border, opposes the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. The same country that\u2019s helping us try to stop the flow of drugs into our country that\u2019s killing young Americans. And also the country that just freed three Americans that will help us create jobs in America because they will be a market for our goods and products without having to pay \u2014 without us having to pay the billions of dollars \u2014 the billion dollars and more that we\u2019ve already paid. Free trade with Colombia is something that\u2019s a no-brainer. But maybe you ought to travel down there and visit them and maybe you could understand it a lot better."}

If it sounds incredible that I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant, that\u2019s because it\u2019s not true. The \u2014 here are the facts. There was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade. The fact is that there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it. And the Illinois Medical Society, the organization of doctors in Illinois, voted against it. Their Hippocratic Oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books. With respect to partial-birth abortion, I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there\u2019s an exception for the mother\u2019s health and life, and this did not contain that exception. And I attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional. And that was rejected, and that\u2019s why I voted present, because I\u2019m willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception. The last point I want to make on the issue of abortion. This is an issue that \u2014 look, it divides us. And in some ways, it may be difficult to \u2014 to reconcile the two views. But there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, \u201cWe should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby.\u201d Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for the first time this year, and I think that\u2019s where we can find some common ground, because nobody\u2019s pro-abortion. I think it\u2019s always a tragic situation. We should try to reduce these circumstances."}

So we\u2019ve got to get our education system right. Now, typically, what\u2019s happened is that there\u2019s been a debate between more money or reform, and I think we need both. In some cases, we are going to have to invest. Early childhood education, which closes the achievement gap, so that every child is prepared for school, every dollar we invest in that, we end up getting huge benefits with improved reading scores, reduced dropout rates, reduced delinquency rates. I think it\u2019s going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in math and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability. And I think it\u2019s important for us to make college affordable. Right now, I meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if they\u2019re going to college, they are taking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt, and it\u2019s very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that they\u2019re going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve proposed a $4,000 tuition credit, every student, every year, in exchange for some form of community service, whether it\u2019s military service, whether it\u2019s Peace Corps, whether it\u2019s working in a community. If we do those things, then I believe that we can create a better school system. But there\u2019s one last ingredient that I just want to mention, and that\u2019s parents. We can\u2019t do it just in the schools. Parents are going to have to show more responsibility. They\u2019ve got to turn off the TV set, put away the video games, and, finally, start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need."}

There\u2019s no doubt that we have achieved equal access to schools in America after a long and difficult and terrible struggle. But what is the advantage in a low income area of sending a child to a failed school and that being your only choice? So choice and competition amongst schools is one of the key elements that\u2019s already been proven in places in like New Orleans and New York City and other places, where we have charter schools, where we take good teachers and we reward them and promote them. And we find bad teachers another line of work. And we have to be able to give parents the same choice, frankly, that Senator Obama and Mrs. Obama had and Cindy and I had to send our kids to the school \u2014 their kids to the school of their choice. Charter schools aren\u2019t the only answer, but they\u2019re providing competition. They are providing the kind of competitions that have upgraded both schools \u2014 types of schools. Now, throwing money at the problem is not the answer. You will find that some of the worst school systems in America get the most money per student. So I believe that we need to reward these good teachers. We need to encourage programs such as Teach for America and Troops to Teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which \u2014 or have the certification that some are required in some states. Look, we must improve education in this country. As far as college education is concerned, we need to make those student loans available. We need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet. We need to have full student loan program for in-state tuition. And we certainly need to adjust the certain loan eligibility to inflation."}

But I do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do. Now we tried to do this under President Bush. He put forward No Child Left Behind. Unfortunately, they left the money behind for No Child Left Behind. And local school districts end up having more of a burden, a bunch of unfunded mandates, the same kind of thing that happened with special education where we did the right thing by saying every school should provide education to kids with special needs, but we never followed through on the promise of funding, and that left local school districts very cash-strapped. So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support. Senator McCain and I actually agree on two things that he just mentioned. Charter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions. I think it\u2019s important to foster competition inside the public schools. And we also agree on the need for making sure that if we have bad teachers that they are swiftly \u2014 after given an opportunity to prove themselves, if they can\u2019t hack it, then we need to move on because our kids have to have their best future. Where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers \u2014 give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system. And I also have to disagree on Senator McCain\u2019s record when it comes to college accessibility and affordability. Recently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didn\u2019t seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was, well, you know, we can\u2019t give money to every interest group that comes along. I don\u2019t think America\u2019s youth are interest groups, I think they\u2019re our future. And this is an example of where we are going to have to prioritize. We can\u2019t say we\u2019re going to do things and then not explain in concrete terms how we\u2019re going to pay for it. And if we\u2019re going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it. It\u2019s not going to happen on its own."}

I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware, Senator Obama, of the program in the Washington, D.C., school system where vouchers are provided and there\u2019s a certain number, I think it\u2019s a thousand and some and some 9,000 parents asked to be eligible for that. Because they wanted to have the same choice that you and I and Cindy and your wife have had. And that is because they wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children. And we all know the state of the Washington, D.C., school system. That was vouchers. That was vouchers, Senator Obama. And I\u2019m frankly surprised you didn\u2019t pay more attention to that example. Now as far as the No Child Left Behind is concerned, it was a great first beginning in my view. It had its flaws, it had its problems, the first time we had looked at the issue of education in America from a nationwide perspective. And we need to fix a lot of the problems. We need to sit down and reauthorize it. But, again, spending more money isn\u2019t always the answer. I think the Head Start program is a great program. A lot of people, including me, said, look, it\u2019s not doing what it should do. By the third grade many times children who were in the Head Start program aren\u2019t any better off than the others. Let\u2019s reform it. Let\u2019s reform it and fund it. That was, of course, out-of-bounds by the Democrats. We need to reform these programs. We need to have transparency. We need to have rewards. It\u2019s a system that cries out for accountability and transparency and the adequate funding. And I just said to you earlier, town hall meeting after town hall meeting, parents come with kids, children \u2014 precious children who have autism. Sarah Palin knows about that better than most. And we\u2019ll find and we\u2019ll spend the money, research, to find the cause of autism. And we\u2019ll care for these young children. And all Americans will open their wallets and their hearts to do so. But to have a situation, as you mentioned in our earlier comments, that the most expensive education in the world is in the United States of America also means that it cries out for reform, as well. And I will support those reforms, and I will fund the ones that are reformed. But I\u2019m not going to continue to throw money at a problem. And I\u2019ve got to tell you that vouchers, where they are requested and where they are agreed to, are a good and workable system. And it\u2019s been proven."}

Children across our country don\u2019t have health care. We\u2019re the richest country on the face of the planet, the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it. I have a plan to cover all Americans. We\u2019re going to make it affordable and accessible.

We shut the loophole which has American workers actually subsidizing the loss of their own job. They just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days - $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from China. I\u2019m going to stand up and fight for the American worker. And I am going to do it in a way that\u2019s fiscally sound. I show how I pay for the health care, how we pay for the education.

Being lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country. This president has taken a $5. 6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see. Health-care costs for the average American have gone up 64 percent; tuitions have gone up 35 percent; gasoline prices up 30 percent; Medicare premiums went up 17 percent a few days ago; prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year. But guess what, America? The wages of Americans have gone down. The jobs that are being created in Arizona right now are paying about $13,700 less than the jobs that we\u2019re losing. And the president just walks on by this problem. The fact is that he\u2019s cut job-training money. $1 billion was cut. They only added a little bit back this year because it\u2019s an election year. They\u2019ve cut the Pell Grants and the Perkins loans to help kids be able to go to college. They\u2019ve cut the training money. They\u2019ve wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed.

There\u2019s a \u2014 no, look, there\u2019s a systemic problem. Health-care costs are on the rise because the consumers are not involved in the decision-making process. Most health-care costs are covered by third parties. And therefore, the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care. And there\u2019s no market forces involved with health care. It\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts. These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax-free savings. Businesses can contribute, employees can contribute on a contractual basis. But this is a way to make sure people are actually involved with the decision-making process on health care. Secondly, I do believe the lawsuits \u2014 I don\u2019t believe, I know \u2014 that the lawsuits are causing health-care costs to rise in America. That\u2019s why I\u2019m such a strong believer in medical liability reform. In the last debate, my opponent said those lawsuits only caused the cost to go up by 1 percent. Well, he didn\u2019t include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the federal government some $28 billion a year and costs our society between $60 billion and $100 billion a year. Thirdly, one of the reasons why there\u2019s still high cost in medicine is because this is \u2014 they don\u2019t use any information technology. It\u2019s like if you looked at the \u2014 it\u2019s the equivalent of the buggy and horse days, compared to other industries here in America. And so, we\u2019ve got to introduce high technology into health care. We\u2019re beginning to do it. We\u2019re changing the language. We want there to be electronic medical records to cut down on error, as well as reduce cost. People tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, it\u2019ll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system. And finally, moving generic drugs to the market quicker. And so, those are four ways to help control the costs in health care."}

Anyway, let me quote the Lewin report. The Lewin report is a group of folks who are not politically affiliated. They analyzed the senator\u2019s plan. It cost $1.2 trillion. The Lewin report accurately noted that there are going to be 20 million people, over 20 million people added to government-controlled health care. It would be the largest increase in government health care ever. If you raise the Medicaid to 300 percent, it provides an incentive for small businesses not to provide private insurance to their employees. Why should they insure somebody when the government\u2019s going to insure it for them? It\u2019s estimated that 8 million people will go from private insurance to government insurance. We have a fundamental difference of opinion. I think government- run health will lead to poor-quality health, will lead to rationing, will lead to less choice. Once a health-care program ends up in a line item in the federal government budget, it leads to more controls. And just look at other countries that have tried to have federally controlled health care. They have poor-quality health care.

We\u2019ll honor our commitment to our seniors. But for our children and our grandchildren, we need to have a different strategy. And recognizing that, I called together a group of our fellow citizens to study the issue. It was a committee chaired by the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a Democrat. And they came up with a variety of ideas for people to look at. I believe that younger workers ought to be allowed to take some of their own money and put it in a personal savings account, because I understand that they need to get better rates of return than the rates of return being given in the current Social Security trust. And the compounding rate of interest effect will make it more likely that the Social Security system is solvent for our children and our grandchildren. I will work with Republicans and Democrats.

It\u2019s against the law in the United States to hire people illegally, and we ought to be enforcing that law properly. And thirdly, we need an earned-legalization program for people who have been here for a long time, stayed out of trouble, got a job, paid their taxes, and their kids are American. We got to start moving them toward full citizenship, out of the shadows. SCHIEFFER: Do you want to respond, Mr. President?"}

It\u2019s long overdue time to raise the minimum wage. And, America, this is one of those issues that separates the president and myself. We have fought to try to raise the minimum wage in the last years. But the Republican leadership of the House and Senate won\u2019t even let us have a vote on it. We\u2019re not allowed to vote on it. They don\u2019t want to raise the minimum wage. The minimum wage is the lowest minimum wage value it has been in our nation in 50 years. If we raise the minimum wage, which I will do over several years to $7 an hour, 9. 2 million women who are trying to raise their families would earn another $3,800 a year. The president has denied 9. 2 million women $3,800 a year, but he doesn\u2019t hesitate to fight for $136,000 to a millionaire. One percent of America got $89 billion last year in a tax cut, but people working hard, playing by the rules, trying to take care of their kids, family values, that we\u2019re supposed to value so much in America \u2014 I\u2019m tired of politicians who talk about family values and don\u2019t value families. What we need to do is raise the minimum wage. We also need to hold on to equal pay. Women work for 76 cents on the dollar for the same work that men do. That\u2019s not right in America. And we had an initiative that we were working on to raise women\u2019s pay. They\u2019ve cut it off. They\u2019ve stopped it. They don\u2019t enforce these kinds of things. Now, I think that it\u2019s a matter of fundamental right that if we raise the minimum wage, 15 million Americans would be positively affected. We\u2019d put money into the hands of people who work hard, who obey the rules, who play for the American dream. And if we did that, we\u2019d have more consumption ability in America, which is what we need right now in order to kick our economy into gear. I will fight tooth and nail to pass the minimum wage."}

Listen, the No Child Left Behind Act is really a jobs act when you think about it. The No Child Left Behind Act says, \u201cWe\u2019ll raise standards. We\u2019ll increase federal spending. But in return for extra spending, we now want people to measure \u2014 states and local jurisdictions to measure to show us whether or not a child can read or write or add and subtract. \u201c You cannot solve a problem unless you diagnose the problem. And we weren\u2019t diagnosing problems. And therefore just kids were being shuffled through the school. And guess who would get shuffled through? Children whose parents wouldn\u2019t speak English as a first language just move through. Many inner-city kids just move through. We\u2019ve stopped that practice now by measuring early. And when we find a problem, we spend extra money to correct it. I remember a lady in Houston, Texas, told me, \u201cReading is the new civil right,\u201d and she\u2019s right. In order to make sure people have jobs for the 21st century, we\u2019ve got to get it right in the education system, and we\u2019re beginning to close a minority achievement gap now. You see, we\u2019ll never be able to compete in the 21st century unless we have an education system that doesn\u2019t quit on children, an education system that raises standards, an education that makes sure there\u2019s excellence in every classroom."}

And I believe that the right of choice is a constitutional right. So I don\u2019t intend to see it undone. Clearly, the president wants to leave in ambivalence or intends to undo it. But let me go a step further. We have a long distance yet to travel in terms of fairness in America. I don\u2019t know how you can govern in this country when you look at New York City and you see that 50 percent of the black males there are unemployed, when you see 40 percent of Hispanic children \u2014 of black children in some cities \u2014 dropping out of high school. And yet the president who talks about No Child Left Behind refused to fully fund \u2014 by $28 billion \u2014 that particular program so you can make a difference in the lives of those young people. Now right here in Arizona, that difference would have been $131 million to the state of Arizona to help its kids be able to have better education and to lift the property tax burden from its citizens. The president reneged on his promise to fund No Child Left Behind. He\u2019ll tell you he\u2019s raised the money, and he has. But he didn\u2019t put in what he promised, and that makes a difference in the lives of our children."}

I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don\u2019t get in the hands of people that shouldn\u2019t have them. But the best way to protect our citizens from guns is to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns. And that\u2019s why early in my administration I called the attorney general and the U. S. attorneys and said: Put together a task force all around the country to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns. And the prosecutions are up by about 68 percent \u2014 I believe \u2014 is the number. Neighborhoods are safer when we crack down on people who commit crimes with guns.

But I\u2019ll tell you this. I\u2019m also a former law enforcement officer. I ran one of the largest district attorney\u2019s offices in America, one of the ten largest. I put people behind bars for the rest of their life. I\u2019ve broken up organized crime. I know something about prosecuting. And most of the law enforcement agencies in America wanted that assault weapons ban. They don\u2019t want to go into a drug bust and be facing an AK-47. I was hunting in Iowa last year with a sheriff from one of the counties there, and he pointed to a house in back of us, and said, \u201cSee the house over? We just did a drug bust a week earlier, and the guy we arrested had an AK-47 lying on the bed right beside him. \u201c Because of the president\u2019s decision today, law enforcement officers will walk into a place that will be more dangerous. Terrorists can now come into America and go to a gun show and, without even a background check, buy an assault weapon today. And that\u2019s what Osama bin Laden\u2019s handbook said, because we captured it in Afghanistan. It encouraged them to do it. So I believe America\u2019s less safe.

And I regret to say that this administration has even blocked steps that could help us move further along. I\u2019ll give you an example. I served on the Small Business Committee for a long time. I was chairman of it once. Now I\u2019m the senior Democrat on it. We used to \u2014 you know, we have a goal there for minority set-aside programs, to try to encourage ownership in the country. They don\u2019t reach those goals. They don\u2019t even fight to reach those goals. They\u2019ve tried to undo them. The fact is that in too many parts of our country, we still have discrimination. And affirmative action is not just something that applies to people of color. Some people have a mistaken view of it in America. It also is with respect to women, it\u2019s with respect to other efforts to try to reach out and be inclusive in our country. I think that we have a long way to go, regrettably. If you look at what\u2019s happened \u2014 we\u2019ve made progress, I want to say that at the same time. During the Clinton years, as you may recall, there was a fight over affirmative action. And there were many people, like myself, who opposed quotas, who felt there were places where it was overreaching. So we had a policy called \u201cMend it, don\u2019t end it. \u201cWe fixed it. And we fixed it for a reason - because there are too many people still in this country who feel the stark resistance of racism, and so we have a distance to travel. As president, I will make certain we travel it. Now, let me just share something. This president is the first president ever, I think, not to meet with the NAACP. This is a president who hasn\u2019t met with the Black Congressional Caucus. This is a president who has not met with the civil rights leadership of our country. If a president doesn\u2019t reach out and bring people in and be inclusive, then how are we going to get over those barriers?

But we ought to have an aggressive effort to make sure people are educated, to make sure when they get out of high school there\u2019s Pell Grants available for them, which is what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve expanded Pell Grants by a million students. Do you realize today in America, we spend $73 billion to help 10 million low- and middle-income families better afford college? That\u2019s the access I believe is necessary, is to make sure every child learns to read, write, add and subtract early, to be able to build on that education by going to college so they can start their careers with a college diploma. I believe the best way to help our small businesses is not only through small-business loans, which we have increased since I\u2019ve been the president of the United States, but to unbundle government contracts so people have a chance to be able to bid and receive a contract to help get their business going. Minority ownership of businesses are up, because we created an environment for the entrepreneurial spirit to be strong. I believe part of a hopeful society is one in which somebody owns something.

And people all find their ways to express it. I was taught \u2014 I went to a church school and I was taught that the two greatest commandments are: Love the Lord, your God, with all your mind, your body and your soul, and love your neighbor as yourself. And frankly, I think we have a lot more loving of our neighbor to do in this country and on this planet. We have a separate and unequal school system in the United States of America. There\u2019s one for the people who have, and there\u2019s one for the people who don\u2019t have. And we\u2019re struggling with that today.

And I think the hug Tom Daschle gave him at that moment was about as genuine a sense of there being no Democrats, no Republicans, we were all just Americans. That\u2019s where we were. That\u2019s not where we are today. I regret to say that the president who called himself a uniter, not a divider, is now presiding over the most divided America in the recent memory of our country. I\u2019ve never seen such ideological squabbles in the Congress of the United States. I\u2019ve never seen members of a party locked out of meetings the way they\u2019re locked out today.

Over 20 years in the United States Senate, I\u2019ve worked with John McCain, who\u2019s sitting here, I\u2019ve worked with other colleagues. I\u2019ve reached across the aisle.

It\u2019s the sunrise side, not the sunset side.

And we\u2019ve been through a lot together during the last 3 3\/4 years. We\u2019ve come through a recession, a stock market decline, an attack on our country. And yet, because of the hard work of the American people and good policies, this economy is growing. Over the next four years, we\u2019ll make sure the economy continues to grow. We reformed our school system, and now there\u2019s an achievement gap in America that\u2019s beginning to close. Over the next four years, we\u2019ll continue to insist on excellence in every classroom in America so that our children have a chance to realize the great promise of America. Over the next four years, we\u2019ll continue to work to make sure health care is available and affordable. Over the next four years, we\u2019ll continue to rally the armies of compassion, to help heal the hurt that exists in some of our country\u2019s neighborhoods. I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019ll win the war on terror, but I understand it requires firm resolve and clear purpose. We must never waver in the face of this enemy that \u2014 these ideologues of hate. And as we pursue the enemy wherever it exists, we\u2019ll also spread freedom and liberty. We got great faith in the ability of liberty to transform societies, to convert a hostile world to a peaceful world. My hope for America is a prosperous America, a hopeful America and a safer world.

But let me just first, Cheryl, if you will, I want to thank Charlie for moderating. I want to thank Washington University for hosting us here this evening. Mr. President, it\u2019s good to be with you again this evening, sir. Cheryl, the president didn\u2019t find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, so he\u2019s really turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception. And the result is that you\u2019ve been bombarded with advertisements suggesting that I\u2019ve changed a position on this or that or the other. Now, the three things they try to say I\u2019ve changed position on are the Patriot Act; I haven\u2019t. I support it. I just don\u2019t like the way John Ashcroft has applied it, and we\u2019re going to change a few things. The chairman of the Republican Party thinks we ought to change a few things. No Child Left Behind Act, I voted for it. I support it. I support the goals. But the president has underfunded it by $28 billion. Right here in St. Louis, you\u2019ve laid off 350 teachers. You\u2019re 150 \u2014 excuse me, I think it\u2019s a little more, about $100 million shy of what you ought to be under the No Child Left Behind Act to help your education system here. So I complain about that. I\u2019ve argued that we should fully funded it. The president says I\u2019ve changed my mind. I haven\u2019t changed my mind: I\u2019m going to fully fund it. So these are the differences. Now, the president has presided over an economy where we\u2019ve lost 1.6 million jobs. The first president in 72 years to lose jobs. I have a plan to put people back to work. That\u2019s not wishy- washy. I\u2019m going to close the loopholes that actually encourage companies to go overseas. The president wants to keep them open. I think I\u2019m right. I think he\u2019s wrong. I\u2019m going to give you a tax cut. The president gave the top 1 percent of income-earners in America, got $89 billion last year, more than the 80 percent of people who earn $100,000 or less all put together. I think that\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s not wishy-washy, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m fighting for, you."}

And obviously we hope that diplomacy works before you ever use force. The hardest decision a president makes is ever to use force. After 9\/11, we had to look at the world differently. After 9\/11, we had to recognize that when we saw a threat, we must take it seriously before it comes to hurt us. In the old days we\u2019d see a threat, and we could deal with it if we felt like it or not. But 9\/11 changed it all. I vowed to our countrymen that I would do everything I could to protect the American people. That\u2019s why we\u2019re bringing Al Qaida to justice. Seventy five percent of them have been brought to justice. That\u2019s why I said to Afghanistan: If you harbor a terrorist, you\u2019re just as guilty as the terrorist. And the Taliban is no longer in power, and Al Qaida no longer has a place to plan. And I saw a unique threat in Saddam Hussein, as did my opponent, because we thought he had weapons of mass destruction. And the unique threat was that he could give weapons of mass destruction to an organization like Al Qaida, and the harm they inflicted on us with airplanes would be multiplied greatly by weapons of mass destruction. And that was the serious, serious threat. So I tried diplomacy, went to the United Nations. But as we learned in the same report I quoted, Saddam Hussein was gaming the oil-for-food program to get rid of sanctions. He was trying to get rid of sanctions for a reason: He wanted to restart his weapons programs. We all thought there was weapons there, Robin. My opponent thought there was weapons there. That\u2019s why he called him a grave threat. I wasn\u2019t happy when we found out there wasn\u2019t weapons, and we\u2019ve got an intelligence group together to figure out why. But Saddam Hussein was a unique threat. And the world is better off without him in power. And my opponent\u2019s plans lead me to conclude that Saddam Hussein would still be in power, and the world would be more dangerous. Thank you, sir."}

I have laid out a different plan, because the president\u2019s plan is not working. You see that every night on television. There\u2019s chaos in Iraq. King Abdullah of Jordan said just yesterday or the day before you can\u2019t hold elections in Iraq with the chaos that\u2019s going on today. Senator Richard Lugar, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that the handling of the reconstruction aid in Iraq by this administration has been incompetent. Those are the Republican chairman\u2019s words. Senator Hagel of Nebraska said that the handling of Iraq is beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing; it\u2019s in the zone of dangerous. Those are the words of two Republicans, respected, both on the Foreign Relations Committee. Now, I have to tell you, I would do something different. I would reach out to our allies in a way that this president hasn\u2019t. He pushed them away time and again, pushed them away at the U.N., pushed them away individually. Two weeks ago, there was a meeting of the North Atlantic Council, which is the political arm of NATO. They discussed the possibility of a small training unit or having a total takeover of the training in Iraq. Did our administration push for the total training of Iraq? No. Were they silent? Yes. Was there an effort to bring all the allies together around that? No, because they\u2019ve always wanted this to be an American effort. You know, they even had the Defense Department issue a memorandum saying, \u201cDon\u2019t bother applying for assistance or for being part of the reconstruction if you weren\u2019t part of our original coalition.\u201d Now, that\u2019s not a good way to build support and reduce the risk for our troops and make America safer. I\u2019m going to get the training done for our troops. I\u2019m going to get the training of Iraqis done faster. And I\u2019m going to get our allies back to the table."}

You might remember the stock market started to decline dramatically six months before I came to office, and then the bubble of the 1990s popped. And that cost us revenue. That cost us revenue. Secondly, we\u2019re at war. And I\u2019m going to spend what it takes to win the war, more than just $120 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan. We\u2019ve got to pay our troops more. We have. We\u2019ve increased money for ammunition and weapons and pay and homeland security. I just told this lady over here we spent \u2014 went from $10 billion to $30 billion to protect the homeland. I think we have an obligation to spend that kind of money. And plus, we cut taxes for everybody. Everybody got tax relief, so that they get out of the recession. I think if you raise taxes during a recession, you head to depression. I come from the school of thought that says when people have more money in their pocket during economic times, it increases demand or investment. Small businesses begin to grow, and jobs are added. We found out today that over the past 13 months, we\u2019ve added 1.9 million new jobs in the last 13 months. I proposed a plan, detailed budget, that shows us cutting the deficit in half by five years. And you\u2019re right, I haven\u2019t vetoed any spending bills, because we work together. Non-homeland, non-defense discretionary spending was raising at 15 percent a year when I got into office. And today it\u2019s less than 1 percent, because we\u2019re working together to try to bring this deficit under control. Like you, I\u2019m concerned about the deficit. But I am not going to shortchange our troops in harm\u2019s way. And I\u2019m not going to run up taxes, which will cost this economy jobs. Thank you for your question."}

I wouldn\u2019t pick a judge who said that the Pledge of Allegiance couldn\u2019t be said in a school because it had the words \u201cunder God\u201d in it. I think that\u2019s an example of a judge allowing personal opinion to enter into the decision-making process as opposed to a strict interpretation of the Constitution. Another example would be the Dred Scott case, which is where judges, years ago, said that the Constitution allowed slavery because of personal property rights. That\u2019s a personal opinion. That\u2019s not what the Constitution says. The Constitution of the United States says we\u2019re all \u2014 you know, it doesn\u2019t say that. It doesn\u2019t speak to the equality of America. And so, I would pick people that would be strict constructionists. We\u2019ve got plenty of lawmakers in Washington, D.C. Legislators make law; judges interpret the Constitution. And I suspect one of us will have a pick at the end of next year \u2014 the next four years. And that\u2019s the kind of judge I\u2019m going to put on there. No litmus test except for how they interpret the Constitution. Thank you."}

I\u2019ll never give a veto over American security to any other entity \u2014 not a nation, not a country, not an institution.

But I\u2019ll also have a better plan of how we\u2019re going to deal with Iraq: training the Iraqi forces more rapidly, getting our allies back to the table with a fresh start, with new credibility, with a president whose judgment the rest of the world trusts. In addition to that, I believe we have a crisis here at home, a crisis of the middle class that is increasingly squeezed, health-care costs going up. I have a plan to provide health care to all Americans. I have a plan to provide for our schools so we keep the standards but we help our teachers teach and elevate our schools by funding No Child Left Behind. I have a plan to protect the environment so that we leave this place in better shape to our children than we were handed it by our parents. That\u2019s the test.

It\u2019s a very important event, and they\u2019ve done a superb job of putting it together. It\u2019s important to look at all of our developments in Iraq within the broader context of the global war on terror. And, after 9\/11, it became clear that we had to do several things to have a successful strategy to win the global war on terror, specifically that we had to go after the terrorists wherever we might find them, that we also had to go after state sponsors of terror, those who might provide sanctuary or safe harbor for terror. And we also then finally had to stand up democracies in their stead afterwards, because that was the only way to guarantee that these states would not again become safe harbors for terror or for the development of deadly weapons. Concern about Iraq specifically focused on the fact that Saddam Hussein had been, for years, listed on the state sponsor of terror, that they he had established relationships with Abu Nidal, who operated out of Baghdad; he paid $25,000 to the families of suicide bombers; and he had an established relationship with Al Qaida. Specifically, look at George Tenet, the CIA director\u2019s testimony before the Committee on Foreign Relations two years ago when he talked about a 10-year relationship. The effort that we\u2019ve mounted with respect to Iraq focused specifically on the possibility that this was the most likely nexus between the terrorists and weapons of mass destruction. The biggest threat we faced today is the possibility of terrorists smuggling a nuclear weapon or a biological agent into one of our own cities and threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans. What we did in Iraq was exactly the right thing to do. If I had it to recommend all over again, I would recommend exactly the same course of action. The world is far safer today because Saddam Hussein is in jail, his government is no longer in power. And we did exactly the right thing."}

And the point is that that\u2019s the place where you\u2019re most likely to see the terrorists come together with weapons of mass destruction, the deadly technologies that Saddam Hussein had developed and used over the years. Now, the fact of the matter is, the big difference here, Gwen, is they are not prepared to deal with states that sponsor terror. They\u2019ve got a very limited view about how to use U.S. military forces to defend America. We heard Senator Kerry say the other night that there ought to be some kind of global test before U.S. troops are deployed preemptively to protect the United States. That\u2019s part of a track record that goes back to the 1970s when he ran for Congress the first time and said troops should not be deployed without U.N. approval. Then, in the mid-\u201980s, he ran on the basis of cutting most of our major defense programs. In 1991, he voted against Desert Storm. It\u2019s a consistent pattern over time of always being on the wrong side of defense issues. A little tough talk in the midst of a campaign or as part of a presidential debate cannot obscure a record of 30 years of being on the wrong side of defense issues. And they give absolutely no indication, based on that record, of being wiling to go forward and aggressively pursue the war on terror with a kind of strategy that will work, that will defeat our enemies and will guarantee that the United States doesn\u2019t again get attacked by the likes of Al Qaida."}

We\u2019ll continue to very aggressively pursue him, and I\u2019m confident eventually we\u2019ll get him. The key to success in Afghanistan has been, again, to go in and go after the terrorists, which we\u2019ve done, and also take down the Taliban regime which allowed them to function there, in effect sponsors, if you will, of the Al Qaida organization. John Edwards, two and a half years ago, six months after we went into Afghanistan announced that it was chaotic, the situation was deteriorating, the warlords were about to take over. Here we are, two and a half years later, we\u2019re four days away from a democratic election, the first one in history in Afghanistan. We\u2019ve got 10 million voters who have registered to vote, nearly half of them women. That election will put in place a democratically elected government that will take over next December. We\u2019ve made enormous progress in Afghanistan, in exactly the right direction, in spite of what John Edwards said two and a half years ago. He just got it wrong. The fact is, as we go forward in Afghanistan, we will pursue Osama bin Laden and the terrorists as long as necessary. We\u2019re standing up Afghan security forces so they can take on responsibility for their own security. We\u2019ll keep U.S. forces there \u2014 we have about 16,000 there today \u2014 as long as necessary, to assist the Afghans in terms of dealing with their security situation. But they\u2019re making significant progress. We have President Karzai, who is in power. They have done wonders writing their own constitution for the first time ever. Schools are open. Young girls are going to school. Women are going to vote. Women are even eligible to run for office. This is major, major progress. There will be democracy in Afghanistan, make no doubt about it.

First, we\u2019re going to actually tell the American people the truth. We\u2019re going to tell them the truth about what\u2019s happening. We\u2019re not going to suggest to them that things are going well in Iraq or anyplace else when, in fact, they\u2019re not.

Because the reality is, for America to lead, for America to do what it\u2019s done for 50 years before this president and vice president came into office, it is critical that we be credible. It is critical that they believe that when America takes action, they can trust what we\u2019re doing, what we say, what we say at the United Nations, what we say in direct conversations with leaders of the world \u2014 of other countries. They need to know that the credibility of the United States is always good, because they will not follow us without that. And unfortunately, we\u2019re seeing the consequences of that right now. It\u2019s one of the reasons that we\u2019re having so much difficulty getting others involved in the effort in Iraq. You know, we\u2019ve taken 90 percent of the coalition casualties. American taxpayers have borne 90 percent of the costs of the effort in Iraq. And we see the result of there not being a coalition - The first Gulf war cost America $5 billion.

John Kerry has voted for the biggest military appropriations bill in the country\u2019s history. John Kerry has voted for the biggest intelligence appropriations in the country\u2019s history. This vice president, when he was secretary of defense, cut over 80 weapons systems, including the very ones he\u2019s criticizing John Kerry for voting against. These are weapons systems, a big chunk of which, the vice president himself suggested we get rid of after the Cold War. The reality is that John Kerry has consistently supported the very men that he served with in Vietnam and led. On the $87 billion, it was clear at the time of that vote that they had no plan to win the peace. We\u2019re seeing the consequences of that everyday on the ground right now. We stood up and said - For our troops, we must have a plan to win the peace. We also thought it was wrong to have a $20 billion fund out of which $7.5 billion was going to go to a no-bid contract for Halliburton, the vice president\u2019s former company. It was wrong then. It\u2019s wrong now."}

What we know is that the president and the vice president have not done the work to build the coalition that we need \u2014 dramatically different than the first Gulf War. We know that they haven\u2019t done it, and we know they can\u2019t do it. They didn\u2019t, by the way, just reject the allies going into lead- up to the war. They also rejected them in the effort to do the reconstruction in Iraq, and that has consequences. What we believe is, as part of our entire plan for Iraq \u2014 and we have a plan for Iraq. They have a plan for Iraq too - more of the same. We have a plan for success. And that plan includes speeding up the training of the military. We have less than half of the staff that we need there to complete that training. Second, make sure that the reconstruction is sped up in a way that the Iraqis see some tangible benefit for what\u2019s happening. And by the way, if we need to, we can take Iraqis out of Iraq to train them. It is not secure enough. It\u2019s so dangerous on the ground that they can\u2019t be trained there. We can take them out of Iraq for purposes of training. We should do whatever has to be done to train the Iraqis and to speed up that process. That works in conjunction with making sure the elections take place on time. Right now, the United Nations, which is responsible for the elections in January, has about 35 people there. Now, that\u2019s compared with a much smaller country like East Timor, where they had over 200 people on the ground. You need more than 35 people to hold an election in Cleveland, much less in Iraq. And they keep saying the election\u2019s on schedule, this is going to happen. The reality is we need a new president with credibility with the rest of the world and who has a real plan for success. Success breeds contribution, breeds joining the coalition. Not only that, I want to go back to what the vice president said. He attacks us about the troops. They sent 40,000 American troops into Iraq without the body armor they needed. They sent them without the armored vehicles they needed. While they were on the ground fighting, they lobbied the Congress to cut their combat pay. This is the height of hypocrisy."}

What happens when we impose unilateral sanctions is, unless there\u2019s a collective effort, then other people move in and take advantage of the situation and you don\u2019t have any impact, except to penalize American companies. We\u2019ve got sanctions on Iran now. We may well want to go to the U.N. Security Council and ask for even tougher sanctions if they don\u2019t live up to their obligations under the initial \u2014 International Atomic Energy Agency Non-Proliferation Treaty. We dealt with Iran differently than we have Iraq partly because Iran has not yet, as Iraq did, violated 12 years of resolutions by the U.N. Security Council. We\u2019re working with the Brits and the Germans and the French, who\u2019ve been negotiating with the Iranians. We recently were actively involved in a meeting with the board of governors in the International Atomic Energy Agency. And as I say, there will be a follow-up meeting in November to determine whether or not Iran\u2019s living up to their commitments and obligations. And if they aren\u2019t, my guess is then the board of governors will recommend sending the whole matter to the U.N. Security Council for the application of the international sanctions, which I think would be exactly the right way to go. We\u2019re addressing North Korea on a similar basis, working with the Chinese, the South Koreans, the Japanese and others to try to bring them around. One of the great by-products, for example, of what we did in Iraq and Afghanistan is that five days after we captured Saddam Hussein, Moammar Gadhafi in Libya came forward and announced that he was going to surrender all of his nuclear materials to the United States, which he has done. This was one of the biggest sources of proliferation in the world today in terms of the threat that was represented by that. The suppliers network that provided that, headed by Mr. A.Q. Khan, has been shut down. We\u2019ve made major progress in dealing here with a major issue with respect to nuclear proliferation.

We\u2019ve, of course, been through a difficult recession, and then the aftermath of 9\/11, where we lost over a million jobs after that attack. But we think the key is to address some basic, fundamental issues that the president\u2019s already working on. I think probably the most successful thing we can do with respect to ending poverty is to get people jobs. There\u2019s no better antidote to poverty than a good, well-paying job that allows somebody to take care of their own family. To do that, we have to make America the best place in the world to do business. And that means we\u2019ve got to deal effectively with tax policy. We\u2019ve got to reduce the litigation costs that are built into our society. We\u2019ve got to provide the adequate medical care and make certain that we can, in fact, create the opportunities that are vital to that process. I\u2019d zero in, in particular, on education. I think the most important thing we can do is have a first-class public school system. I\u2019m a product of public schools. And the president, his first legislative priority was the No Child Left Behind Act. It was the first piece of legislation we introduced. We got it passed that first summer on a bipartisan basis. We even had Ted Kennedy on board for the effort. And it does several things. It establishes high standards. It, at the same time, sets up a system of testing with respect to our school system, so we can establish accountability to parents and make certain that they understand how well their students are doing. And they have the opportunity to move students out of poorly performing schools to good schools. It strikes me that that is absolutely the heart of what needs to be done from the standpoint of education. It\u2019s also important, as we go forward in the next term, we want to be able to take what we\u2019ve done for elementary education and move it into the secondary education. It\u2019s working. We\u2019ve seen reports now of a reduction in the achievement gap between majority students and minority students. We\u2019re making significant progress."}

And it\u2019s had real consequences in places like Cleveland. Cleveland is a wonderful, distinguished city that\u2019s done a lot of great things, but it has the highest poverty rate in the country. One out of almost two children in Cleveland are now living in poverty. During the time that the vice president and the president have been in office, 4 million more Americans have fallen into poverty. During the time that the vice president and the president have been in office, 4 million more Americans have fallen into poverty.

We have to do better. We have a plan. We\u2019re going to get rid of \u2014 by the way, they\u2019re for outsourcing jobs. I want to make sure people hear that, the fundamental difference with us. The administration says over and over that the outsourcing of millions of American jobs is good. We\u2019re against it. We want to get rid of tax cuts for companies sending jobs overseas. We want to balance this budget, get back to fiscal responsibility. And we want to invest in the creative, innovative jobs of the future."}

You know, if you look at what\u2019s happened over the last four years, we have gone from a $5 trillion projected surplus when George Bush took office to a $3 trillion projected deficit. They promised they were going to put $2 trillion of the surplus aside from Social Security. Not done. Not only that, it\u2019s the biggest fiscal turnaround in American history. And there\u2019s no end in sight. The Washington Post just reported they have several trillion dollars of additional tax cuts and spending, no suggestion of what they\u2019re going to do about it. John Kerry and I believe we have a moral responsibility not to leave trillions of debt to our children and our grandchildren. So here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do, to answer your question. To pay for the things that we believe need to be done \u2014 and I hope to get the chance to talk about health care and also about education, because we have plans on both of those subjects \u2014 what we\u2019re going to do is roll back tax cuts. And I want everyone to hear this, because there have been exaggerations made on the campaign trail - Roll back tax cuts for people who make over $200,000 a year; we will do that. We want to keep the tax cuts that are in place for people who make less than $200,000 a year and give additional tax cuts to those middle-class families, tax cuts for health care, tax cuts to help families pay for their college tuition, tax cuts for child care. These families are struggling and hurting, and they need more tax relief, not less tax relief. But to help get us back on the path to a balanced budget, we also want to get rid of some of the bureaucratic spending in Washington. One of the amazing things that\u2019s happened is they\u2019ve actually layered on more supervisory people, people at the supervisory level, in this government. We also want to close some corporate loopholes. Now, I want to be honest with people. We can\u2019t eliminate this deficit. People have heard that over and over and over in four years. We cannot do it. We\u2019re in too deep a hole. But we can cut the deficit in half. And if we move, we can move this country back on a path to fiscal responsibility."}

Let me say first, on an issue that the vice president said in his last answer before we got to this question, talking about tax policy, the country needs to know that under what they have put in place and want to put in place, a millionaire sitting by their swimming pool, collecting their statements to see how much money they\u2019re making, make their money from dividends, pays a lower tax rate than the men and women who are receiving paychecks for serving on the ground in Iraq. Now, they may think that\u2019s right. John Kerry and I do not. We don\u2019t just value wealth, which they do. We value work in this country.

I think they love her very much. And you can\u2019t have anything but respect for the fact that they\u2019re willing to talk about the fact that they have a gay daughter, the fact that they embrace her. It\u2019s a wonderful thing. And there are millions of parents like that who love their children, who want their children to be happy. And I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman, and so does John Kerry. I also believe that there should be partnership benefits for gay and lesbian couples in long-term, committed relationships. But we should not use the Constitution to divide this country. No state for the last 200 years has ever had to recognize another state\u2019s marriage. This is using the Constitution as a political tool, and it\u2019s wrong."}

Well let me say, first of all, I\u2019m proud of the work I did on behalf of kids and families against big insurance companies, big drug companies and big HMOs. We do have too many lawsuits. And the reality is there\u2019s something that we can do about it. John Kerry and I have a plan to do something about it. We want to put more responsibility on the lawyers to require, before a case, malpractice, which the vice president just spoke about, have the case reviewed by independent experts to determine if the case is serious and meritorious before it can be filed; hold the lawyers responsible for that, certify that and hold the lawyer financially responsible if they don\u2019t do it; have a three-strikes-and-you\u2019re-out rule so that a lawyer who files three of these cases without meeting this requirement loses their right to file these cases. That way we keep the cases out of the system that don\u2019t belong in the system. They talk about frivolous cases. We believe cases that don\u2019t belong in the system should never be in the system. But we don\u2019t believe that we should take away the right of people like Valerie Lakey, who was the young girl who I represented, five years old, severely injured for life, on a defective swimming pool drain cover. It turns out the company knew of 12 other children who had either been killed or severely injured by the same problem. They hid it. They didn\u2019t tell anybody. They could have fixed it with a 2-cent screw. That\u2019s wrong. John Kerry and I are always going to stand with the Valerie Lakeys of the world, and not with the insurance companies."}

The president has been deeply concerned about it. He has moved and proposed and gotten through the Congress authorization for $15 billion to help in the international effort, to be targeted in those places where we need to do everything we can, through a combination of education as well as providing the kinds of medicines that will help people control the infection. Here in the United States, we\u2019ve made significant progress. I have not heard those numbers with respect to African- American women. I was not aware that it was \u2014 that they\u2019re in epidemic there, because we have made progress in terms of the overall rate of AIDS infection, and I think primarily through a combination of education and public awareness as well as the development, as a result of research, of drugs that allow people to live longer lives even though they are infected \u2014 obviously we need to do more of that."}

John Kerry and I believe that needs to be doubled. And I might add, on the first year of their commitment, they came up significantly short of what they had promised. And we probably won\u2019t get a chance to talk about Africa. Let me just say a couple of things. The AIDS epidemic in Africa, which is killing millions and millions of people and is a frightening thing not just for the people of Africa but also for the rest of the world, that, combined with the genocide that we\u2019re now seeing in Sudan, are two huge moral issues for the United States of America, which John Kerry spoke about eloquently last Thursday night. Here at home we need to do much more. And the vice president spoke about doing research, making sure we have the drugs available, making sure that we do everything possible to have prevention. But it\u2019s a bigger question than that. You know, we have 5 million Americans who\u2019ve lost their health care coverage in the last four years; 45 million Americans without health care coverage. We have children who don\u2019t have health care coverage. If kids and adults don\u2019t have access to preventative care, if they\u2019re not getting the health care that they need day after day after day, the possibility of not only developing AIDS and having a problem \u2014 having a problem \u2014 a life-threatening problem, but the problem of developing other life-threatening diseases is there every day of their lives."}

Well, in some respects, I think, probably there are more similarities than there are differences in our personal story. I don\u2019t talk about myself very much, but I\u2019ve heard Senator Edwards, and as I listen to him, I find some similarities. I come from relatively modest circumstances. My grandfather never even went to high school. I\u2019m the first in my family to graduate from college. I carried a ticket in the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers for six years. I\u2019ve been laid off, been hospitalized without health insurance. So I have some idea of the problems that people encounter. So I think the personal stories are, in some respects, surprisingly similar. With respect to how we\u2019ve spent our careers, I obviously made a choice for public service. And I\u2019ve been at it for a good long time now, except for those periods when we lost elections. And that goes with the turf, as well, too. I\u2019m absolutely convinced that the threat we face now, the idea of a terrorist in the middle of one of our cities with a nuclear weapon, is very real and that we have to use extraordinary measures to deal with it. I feel very strongly that the significance of 9\/11 cannot be underestimated. It forces us to think in new ways about strategy, about national security, about how we structure our forces and about how we use U.S. military power. Some people say we should wait until we are attacked before we use force. I would argue we\u2019ve already been attacked. We lost more people on 9\/11 than we lost at Pearl Harbor. And I\u2019m a very strong advocate of a very aggressive policy of going after the terrorists and those who support terror."}

John Kerry made clear on Thursday night that \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, I broke the rules. We made clear \u2014 we made clear on Thursday night that we will do that, and we will do it aggressively. But there are things that need to be done to keep this country safe that have not yet been done. For example, three years after 9\/11, we find out that the administration still does not have a unified terrorist watch list. It\u2019s amazing. Three years. What are we waiting for? You know, we still don\u2019t have one list that everyone can work off of to see if terrorists are entering this country.

We had some success early on, I think, in No Child Left Behind, when we, in fact, had broad, bipartisan support. We had a lot of support for the Patriot Act, when we passed that on a bipartisan basis. Now we\u2019re seeing objection to that by the other side. All I know is to continue to try to work it. It\u2019s a disappointment, in a sense, that I remember from my earlier service when things worked much differently, when, in fact, some of my best friends in the Congress were people I worked with, like Tom Foley, who was a majority leader and later speaker of the House. One of my strongest allies in Congress when I was secretary of defense was Jack Murtha, a Democrat who is chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. We used to be able to do more together on a bipartisan basis than seems possible these days. I\u2019m not sure exactly why. I think, in part, it may be the change in the majority-minority status in the Senate has been difficult for both sides to adjust to. And the Senate, of course, has been very evenly divided, 50-50, then 51-49, then 49-51 the other way. We\u2019ll keep working at it. I think it\u2019s important for us to try.

We\u2019re going to cover all kids. Not only that, we\u2019re going to bring down costs by pooling the catastrophic costs so we bring down premiums. And we\u2019re going to give tax breaks directly to families, save them up to $1,000 a year, and to businesses \u2014 the vice president talked about that a few minutes ago \u2014 so that they can provide health care to their employees. And we\u2019re also going to finally do something about the cost of prescription drugs. They\u2019ve blocked allowing prescription drugs into this country from Canada. We\u2019re going to allow it. They would not allow the government to use its negotiating power to get discounts for seniors. We\u2019re going to allow it. We\u2019re also going to stand up to the drug companies and do something about these drug company ads on television which are out of control."}

You know, when I was young and growing up, I remember coming down the steps into the kitchen, early in the morning, and I would see the glow of the television. And I\u2019d see my father sitting at a table. He wasn\u2019t paying bills, and he wasn\u2019t doing paperwork from work. What he was doing was learning math on television. Now, he didn\u2019t have a college education, but he was doing what he could do to get a better job in the mill where he worked. I was proud of him. I\u2019m still proud of him. And I was also hopeful, because I knew that I lived in a country where I could get a college education. Here\u2019s the truth: I have grown up in the bright light of America. But that light is flickering today. Now, I know that the vice president and the president don\u2019t see it, but you do. You see it when your incomes are going down and the cost of everything \u2014 college tuition, health care \u2014 is going through the roof. You see it when you sit at your table each night and there\u2019s an empty chair because a loved one is serving in Iraq or Afghanistan. What they\u2019re going to give you is four more years of the same. John Kerry and I believe that we can do better. We believe in a strong middle-class in this country. That\u2019s why we have a plan to create jobs, getting rid of tax cuts for companies outsourcing your jobs; give tax cuts to companies that\u2019ll keep jobs here in America. That\u2019s why we have a health care plan. That\u2019s why we have a plan to keep you safe and to fix this mess in Iraq. The truth is that every four years you get to decide.

First of all, he made the misjudgment of saying to America that he was going to build a true alliance, that he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through the inspections. In fact, he first didn\u2019t even want to do that. And it wasn\u2019t until former Secretary of State Jim Baker and General Scowcroft and others pushed publicly and said you\u2019ve got to go to the U.N., that the president finally changed his mind \u2014 his campaign has a word for that \u2014 and went to the United Nations. Now, once there, we could have continued those inspections. We had Saddam Hussein trapped. He also promised America that he would go to war as a last resort. Those words mean something to me, as somebody who has been in combat. \u201cLast resort.\u201d You\u2019ve got to be able to look in the eyes of families and say to those parents, \u201cI tried to do everything in my power to prevent the loss of your son and daughter.\u201d I don\u2019t believe the United States did that. And we pushed our allies aside. And so, today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the cost - $200 billion \u2014 $200 billion that could have been used for health care, for schools, for construction, for prescription drugs for seniors, and it\u2019s in Iraq. And Iraq is not even the center of the focus of the war on terror. The center is Afghanistan, where, incidentally, there were more Americans killed last year than the year before; where the opium production is 75 percent of the world\u2019s opium production; where 40 to 60 percent of the economy of Afghanistan is based on opium; where the elections have been postponed three times. The president moved the troops, so he\u2019s got 10 times the number of troops in Iraq than he has in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is. Does that mean that Saddam Hussein was 10 times more important than Osama bin Laden \u2014 than, excuse me, Saddam Hussein more important than Osama bin Laden? I don\u2019t think so."}

The world is better off without Saddam Hussein. I was hoping diplomacy would work. I understand the serious consequences of committing our troops into harm\u2019s way. It\u2019s the hardest decision a president makes. So I went to the United Nations. I didn\u2019t need anybody to tell me to go to the United Nations. I decided to go there myself. And I went there hoping that, once and for all, the free world would act in concert to get Saddam Hussein to listen to our demands. They passed the resolution that said, \u201cDisclose, disarm, or face serious consequences.\u201d I believe, when an international body speaks, it must mean what it says. Saddam Hussein had no intention of disarming. Why should he? He had 16 other resolutions and nothing took place. As a matter of fact, my opponent talks about inspectors. The facts are that he was systematically deceiving the inspectors. That wasn\u2019t going to work. That\u2019s kind of a pre-September 10th mentality, the hope that somehow resolutions and failed inspections would make this world a more peaceful place. He was hoping we\u2019d turn away.

That is noble. That\u2019s the most noble thing that anybody can do. And I want to make sure the outcome honors that nobility. Now, we have a choice here. I\u2019ve laid out a plan by which I think we can be successful in Iraq: with a summit, by doing better training, faster, by cutting \u2014 by doing what we need to do with respect to the U.N. and the elections. There\u2019s only 25 percent of the people in there. They can\u2019t have an election right now. The president\u2019s not getting the job done.

In answer to your question about Iraq and sending people into Iraq, he just said, \u201cThe enemy attacked us.\u201d Saddam Hussein didn\u2019t attack us. Osama bin Laden attacked us. Al Qaida attacked us. And when we had Osama bin Laden cornered in the mountains of Tora Bora, 1,000 of his cohorts with him in those mountains. With the American military forces nearby and in the field, we didn\u2019t use the best trained troops in the world to go kill the world\u2019s number one criminal and terrorist.

That\u2019s the enemy that was allowed to walk out of those mountains. That\u2019s the enemy that is now in 60 countries, with stronger recruits. He also said Saddam Hussein would have been stronger. That is just factually incorrect. Two-thirds of the country was a no-fly zone when we started this war. We would have had sanctions. We would have had the U.N. inspectors. Saddam Hussein would have been continually weakening.

Let me say \u2014 I certainly hope so. Before I was sworn in, the policy of this government was to have bilateral negotiations with North Korea. And we signed an agreement with North Korea that my administration found out that was not being honored by the North Koreans. And so I decided that a better way to approach the issue was to get other nations involved, just besides us. And in Crawford, Texas, Jiang Zemin and I agreed that the nuclear-weapons-free peninsula, Korean Peninsula, was in his interest and our interest and the world\u2019s interest. And so we began a new dialogue with North Korea, one that included not only the United States, but now China. And China\u2019s a got a lot of influence over North Korea, some ways more than we do. As well, we included South Korea, Japan and Russia. So now there are five voices speaking to Kim Jong Il, not just one. And so if Kim Jong Il decides again to not honor an agreement, he\u2019s not only doing injustice to America, he\u2019d be doing injustice to China, as well. And I think this will work. It\u2019s not going to work if we open up a dialogue with Kim Jong Il. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what he wants. He wants to unravel the six- party talks, or the five-nation coalition that\u2019s sending him a clear message. On Iran, I hope we can do the same thing, continue to work with the world to convince the Iranian mullahs to abandon their nuclear ambitions. We worked very closely with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Great Britain, who have been the folks delivering the message to the mullahs that if you expect to be part of the world of nations, get rid of your nuclear programs. The IAEA is involved. There\u2019s a special protocol recently been passed that allows for inspections. I hope we can do it. And we\u2019ve got a good strategy."}

He changes positions on something as fundamental as what you believe in your core, in your heart of hearts, is right in Iraq. You cannot lead if you send mixed messages.

Thank you very much to the university, again. Thank you, Mr. President. My fellow Americans, as I\u2019ve said at the very beginning of this debate, both President Bush and I love this country very much. There\u2019s no doubt, I think, about that. But we have a different set of convictions about how we make our country stronger here at home and respected again in the world. I know that for many of you sitting at home, parents of kids in Iraq, you want to know who\u2019s the person who could be a commander in chief who could get your kids home and get the job done and win the peace. And for all the rest of the parents in America who are wondering about their kids going to the school or anywhere else in the world, what kind of world they\u2019re going to grow up in, let me look you in the eye and say to you: I defended this country as a young man in war, and I will defend it as president of the United States. But I have a difference with this president. I believe when we\u2019re strongest when we reach out and lead the world and build strong alliances. I have a plan for Iraq. I believe we can be successful. I\u2019m not talking about leaving. I\u2019m talking about winning. And we need a fresh start, a new credibility, a president who can bring allies to our side. I also have a plan to win the war on terror, funding homeland security, strengthening our military, cutting our finances, reaching out to the world, again building strong alliances. I believe America\u2019s best days are ahead of us because I believe that the future belongs to freedom, not to fear. That\u2019s the country that I\u2019m going to fight for. And I ask you to give me the opportunity to make you proud. I ask you to give me the opportunity to lead this great nation, so that we can be stronger here at home, respected again in the world, and have responsible leadership that we deserve. Thank you.

I would like to thank Governor Bush for participating, and I would like to say I\u2019m happy to be here with Tipper and our family. I have actually not questioned Governor Bush\u2019s experience. I have questioned his proposals. And here is why. I think this is a very important moment for our country. We have achieved extraordinary prosperity. And in this election, America has to make an important choice. Will we use our prosperity to enrich not just the few, but all of our families? I believe we have to make the right and responsible choices. If I\u2019m entrusted with the presidency, here are the choices that I will make. I will balance the budget every year. I will pay down the national debt. I will put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox and protect them. And I will cut taxes for middle-class families. I believe it\u2019s important to resist the temptation to squander our surplus. If we make the right choices, we can have a prosperity that endures and enriches all of our people. If I\u2019m entrusted with the presidency, I will help parents and strengthen families because, you know, if we have prosperity that grows and grows, we still won\u2019t be successful unless we strengthen families by, for example, ensuring that children can always go to schools that are safe. By giving parents the tools to protect their children against cultural pollution. I will make sure that we invest in our country and our families. And I mean investing in education, health care, the environment, and middle-class tax cuts and retirement security. That is my agenda and that is why I think that it\u2019s not just a question of experience."}

I said that his tax cut plan, for example, raises the question of whether it\u2019s the right choice for the country. And let me give you an example of what I mean. Under Governor Bush\u2019s tax cut proposal, he would spend more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of the new spending that he proposes for education, health care, prescription drugs and national defense all combined. Now, I think those are the wrong priorities. Now, under my proposal, for every dollar that I propose in spending for things like education and health care, I will put another dollar into middle class tax cuts. And for every dollar that I spend in those two categories, I\u2019ll put $2 toward paying down the national debt. I think it\u2019s very important to keep the debt going down and completely eliminate it. And I also think it\u2019s very important to go to the next stage of welfare reform. Our country has cut the welfare rolls in half. I fought hard from my days in the Senate and as vice president to cut the welfare rolls and we\u2019ve moved millions of people in America into good jobs. But it\u2019s now time for the next stage of welfare reform, and include fathers and not only mothers."}

I agree that the surplus is the American people\u2019s money, it\u2019s your money. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t think we should give nearly half of it to the wealthiest 1%, because the other 99% have had an awful lot to do with building the surplus in our prosperity."}

I\u2019ve said that eight years ago they campaigned on prescription drugs for seniors. And four years ago they campaigned on getting prescription drugs for seniors. And now they\u2019re campaigning on getting prescription drugs for seniors. It seems like they can\u2019t get it done. Now, they may blame other folks, but it\u2019s time to get somebody in Washington who is going to work with both Republicans and Democrats to get some positive things done when it comes to our seniors. And so what I\u2019ve said is that there\u2019s been some missed opportunities. They\u2019ve had a chance. They\u2019ve had a chance to form consensus. I\u2019ve got a plan on Medicare, for example, that\u2019s a two-stage plan that says we\u2019ll have immediate help for seniors and what I call immediate Helping Hand, a $48 billion program. But I also want to say to seniors, if you\u2019re happy with Medicare the way it is, fine, you can stay in the program. But we\u2019re going to give you additional choices like they give federal employees in the federal employee health plan. They have a variety of choices to choose, so should seniors. And my point has been, as opposed to politicizing an issue like Medicare, in other words, holding it up as an issue, hoping somebody bites it and try to clobber them over the head with it for political purposes, this year, in the year 2000, it\u2019s time to get it done once and for all. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been critical about the administration for. Same with Social Security. I think there was a good opportunity to bring Republicans and Democrats together to reform the Social Security system so seniors will never go without. Those on Social Security today will have their promise made, but also to give younger workers the option at their choice of being able to manage some of their own money in the private sector to make sure there\u2019s a Social Security system around tomorrow. There are a lot of young workers at our rallies we go to that when they hear I\u2019ll trust them at their option to be able to manage, under certain guidelines, some of their own money to get a better rate of return so that they\u2019ll have a retirement plan in the future, they begin to nod their heads and they want a different attitude in Washington."}

Everywhere I go on the campaign trail I see moms and dads whose son or daughter may wear the uniform and they tell me about how discouraged their son or daughter may be. A recent poll was taken among 1,000 enlisted personnel, as well as officers, over half of whom will leave the service when their time of enlistment is up. The captains are leaving the service. There is a problem. And it\u2019s going to require a new commander in chief to rebuild the military power.

I served for eight years in the United States Senate and served on the Armed Services Committee. For the last eight years I\u2019ve served on the National Security Council, and when the conflict came up in Bosnia, I saw a genocide in the heart of Europe with the most violent war on the continent of Europe since World War II. Look, that\u2019s where World War I started in the Balkans. My uncle was a victim of poisonous gas there. Millions of Americans saw the results of that conflict. We have to be willing to make good, sound judgments. Incidentally, I know the value of making sure our troops have the latest technology.

This is a very important moment in the history of our country. Look, we\u2019ve got the biggest surpluses in all of American history. The key question that has to be answered in this election is will we use that prosperity wisely in a way that benefits all of our people and doesn\u2019t go just to the few. Almost half of all the tax cut benefits, as I said under Governor Bush\u2019s plan, go to the wealthiest 1%. I think we have to make the right and responsible choices. I think we have to invest in education, protecting the environment, health care, a prescription drug benefit that goes to all seniors, not just to the poor, under Medicare, not relying on HMOs and insurance companies. I think that we have to help parents and strengthen families by dealing with the kind of inappropriate entertainment material that families are just heart sick that their children are exposed to. I think we\u2019ve got to have welfare reform taken to the next stage. I think that we have got to balance the budget every single year, pay down the national debt and, in fact, under my proposal the national debt will be completely eliminated by the year 2012. I think we need to put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox. The governor will not put Medicare in a lockbox. I don\u2019t think it should be used as a piggy bank for other programs. I think it needs to be moved out of the budget and protected. I\u2019ll veto anything that takes money out of Social Security or Medicare for anything other than Social Security or Medicare. Now, the priorities are just very different. I\u2019ll give you a couple of examples. For every new dollar that I propose for spending on health care, Governor Bush spends $3 for a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%. Now, for every dollar that I propose to spend on education, he spends $5 on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%. Those are very clear differences."}

And if you just add the numbers up, he still hasn\u2019t denied it, he spends more money on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1% than all his new proposals for prescription drugs, healthcare, education, and national defense combined. Now those are the wrong priorities. $665 billion over ten years for the wealthiest 1%. As I said, almost 30% of it goes to Americans that make more than $1 million per year. Every middle class family is eligible for a tax cut under my proposal. Let me give you some specific examples. I believe college tuition up to $10,000 per year ought to be tax deductible so middle-class families can choose to send their children to college. I believe all senior citizens should be able to choose their own doctors and get prescription drugs from their own pharmacists with Medicare paying half the bill. I believe parents ought to be able to make more choices need more public and charter school choice to send their kids always to a safe school. We need to make education the number one priority in our country and treat teachers like the professionals that they are. And that\u2019s why I have made it a number one priority in my budget, not a tax cut for the wealthy."}

If you\u2019re a single mother making $22,000 a year and you have two children, under this tax code, for every additional dollar you make, you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making more than $200,000 a year, and that is not right. My plan drops the rate from 15% to 10% and increases the child credit from $500 to $1,000 to make the code more fair for everybody, not just a few, not just a handful. Everybody who pays taxes ought to get some relief."}

Let me give you a story about public education, if I might. It\u2019s about Kipp Academy in Houston, Texas. A charter school run by some people from Teach For America. Young folks saying I\u2019m going to do something good for my country. I want to teach. A guy named Michael runs the school. It is a school full of so-called at-risk children. It\u2019s how we unfortunately label certain children. Basically it means they can\u2019t learn. It\u2019s a school of strong discipline and high standards. It\u2019s one of the best schools in Houston. Here are the key ingredients. High expectations, strong accountabily. What Michael says, don\u2019t put all these rules on us, just let us teach and hold us accountable for every grade. That\u2019s what we do. And as a result, these mainly Hispanic youngsters are some of the best learners in Houston, Texas. That\u2019s my vision for public education all around America. Many of you viewers don\u2019t know, but Laura and I sent our girls to public school. They went to Austin High School. And many of the public schools are meeting the call. But, unfortunately, a lot of schools are trapping children in schools that just won\u2019t teach and won\u2019t change. Here is the role of the federal government. One is to change Head Start to a reading program. Two is to say if you want to access reading money, you can do so. The goal is for every single child to learn to Read. there must by K-2 diagnostic teaching tools, teacher training money, available. Three, we have to consolidate the federal programs to free districts to free the schools and encourage innovators like Michael. Let them reach out beyond the confines of the current structure to recruit teach-for-the-children type teachers. Four, we\u2019re going to say if you receive federal money, measure third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grade. Show us if they are learning to read, write, add and subtract and if so there will be bonus plans. But if not, instead of continuing to subsidize failure, the money will go to \u2014 the federal money will go to the parents for public school or charter school or tutorial or Catholic school. What I care about is children. And so does Michael Feinberg. And you know what? It can happen in America with the right kind of leadership."}

I\u2019ve also proposed a voluntary national test in the fourth grade and eighth grade, and a form of testing the governor has not endorsed. I think that all new teachers ought to be tested in the subjects that they teach. We\u2019ve got to recruit 100,000 new teachers. And I have budgeted for that. We\u2019ve got to reduce the class size so that the student who walks in has more one-on-one time with the teacher. We ought to have universal pre-school and we ought to make college tuition tax deductible, up to $10,000 a year. I would like to tell you a quick story. I got a letter today as I left Sarasota, Florida. I\u2019m here with a group of 13 people from around the country who helped me prepare. We had a great time. Two days ago we ate lunch at a restaurant. The guy that served us lunch gave me a letter today. His name is Randy Ellis. He has a 15-year-old daughter named Caley, who is in Sarasota High School. Her science class was supposed to be for 24 students. She\u2019s the 36th student in that classroom. They sent me a picture of her in the classroom. They can\u2019t squeeze another desk in for her, so she has to stand during class. I want the federal government, consistent with local control and new accountability, to make improvement of our schools the number one priority so Caley will have a desk and can sit down in a classroom where she can learn."}

You may claim you\u2019ve got mandatory testing but you don\u2019t, Mr. Vice President. That\u2019s a huge difference. Testing is the cornerstone of reform. You know how I know? Because it\u2019s the cornerstone of reform in the State of Texas. Republicans and Democrats came together and said what can we do to make our public education the best in the country? We\u2019ve done a long way working together to do so. The cornerstone is to have strong accountability in return for money and in return for flexibility. We\u2019re going to ask you to show us whether or not \u2014 we ask you to post the results on the Internet. We encourage parents to take a look at the comparative results of schools. We have a strong charter school movement that I signed the legislation to get started in the State of Texas.

I think the governor may not have heard what I said clearly. The voluntary national testing is in addition to the mandatory testing that we require of states. All schools, all school districts, students themselves, and required teacher testing, which goes a step farther than Governor Bush has been willing to go. Here are a couple of differences, though, Jim. Governor Bush is in favor of vouchers which take taxpayer money away from public schools and give them to private schools that are not accountable for how the money is used and don\u2019t have to take all applicants. Now, private schools play a great role in our society. All of our children have gone to both public schools and private schools. But I don\u2019t think private schools should have a right to take taxpayer money away from public schools at a time when Caley Ellis is standing in that classroom. Let me give you another example. I went to a school in Dade County, Florida where the facilities are so overcrowded the children have to eat lunch in shifts with the first shift for lunch starting at 9:30 in the morning. Look, this is a funding crisis all around the country. There are fewer parents of school-age children as a percentage of the voting population and there is the largest generation of students ever. We\u2019re in an information age when learning is more important than ever. 90% of our kids go to public schools. We have to make it the number one priority. Modernize our schools, reduce class size, recruit new teachers, give every child a chance to learn with one-on-one time in a quality \u2014 high-quality, safe school. If it\u2019s a failing school, shut it down and reopen it under a new principal with a turnaround team of specialists the way Governor Jim Hunt does in North Carolina. Here is another difference. The governor, if it\u2019s a failing school, would leave the children in that failing school for three years and then give a little bit of money to the parents, a down payment on a down payment for private school tuition, and pretend that that would be enough for them to go out and go to a private school. It\u2019s an illusion."}

Instead of a high unemployment, we have the lowest African-American and Latin American unemployment rates in history and 22 million new jobs. It\u2019s not good enough. Too many people have been left behind. We have got to do much more. The key is job training, education, investments in health care and education, environment, retirement security.

I\u2019m totally opposed to diverting one out of every six dollars out of the Social Security trust fund, as the Governor has proposed, into the stock market.

Will we use the prosperity to enrich all of our families and not just a few? One important way of looking at this is to ask who are you going to fight for? Throughout my career in public service, I have fought for the working men and women of this country, middle-class families. Why? Because you are the ones who have the hardest time paying taxes, the hardest time making ends meet. You are the ones who are making car payments and mortgage payments and doing right by your kids. And a lot of times there are powerful forces that are against you. Make no mistake about it, they do have undue influence in Washington, D.C. and it makes a difference if you have a president who will fight for you. I know one thing about the position of president, it\u2019s the only position in our Constitution that is filled by an individual who is given the responsibility to fight not just for one state or one district or the well-connected or wealthy, but to fight for all of the people, including especially those who most need somebody who will stand up and take on whatever powerful forces might stand in the way.

Our desire is to find ways to reform our educational system, to return it to its former glory. I\u2019m a product of public schools, my family, wife and daughters all went to public schools. We believe very much in the public school system. But if you look at where we are from the standpoint of the nation, recent exams. For example, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, an independent testing service, shows there\u2019s been no progress on reading scores in the last eight years. Almost no progress on math. The achievement gap between minority and non-minority students is as big as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever been. We\u2019ve had a significant increase in spending for education nationwide, but it has produced almost no positive results. That\u2019s unacceptable from our standpoint. If you look at it and think about it, we now have in our most disadvantaged communities, 70% of our fourth graders can\u2019t read at the basic level of understanding. We\u2019ve graduated 15 million kids from high school in the last few years who can\u2019t read at a significant level. They are permanently sentenced to a lifetime of failure. What we want to do is to change that. We think we know how to do it. Governor Bush has done it in Texas. We want to emphasize local control so that people here in Danville, KY decide what is best for their kids. We want to insist on high standards. One of the worst things we can do is fail to establish high standards, in effect to say to a youngster because of their ethnic background or income level, we don\u2019t have the same kind of expectations from you that we have from everybody else. We want accountability. We have to test every child every year to know whether or not we\u2019re making progress with respect to achieving those goals and objectives.

I disagree with what my opponent has said. A lot of progress has been made in recent years. Average testing scores are up and a lot of extraordinary work is being done by tens of thousands of parents, teachers and administrators all around America. There is more to be done. If you\u2019ll allow me, I want to go back to your last question. It leads to this question. I think both of us agree that leaving aside the Social Security and Medicare surpluses, there\u2019s $1.8 trillion in surplus available to spend over the next ten years. As I said before we\u2019re being fiscally responsible about it. We\u2019re taking $300 billion off the top to put in reserve fund. The rest we\u2019ll use for middle class tax cuts and invest in programs like education. There\u2019s a big difference between these two tickets. Our opponents are going to spend $1.6 trillion of the $1.8 trillion surplus projected on that big tax cut that Al Gore talked about the other night so effectively. We\u2019re saving money to invest in education. You cannot reform education and improve it in this country without spending some money. Al Gore and I have committed $170 billion for that purpose. To recruit 100,000 new teachers to reduce the size of classrooms. To help local school districts build new buildings so our children are not learning in crumbling classrooms. And we\u2019re not just going to stop at high school. We\u2019re going to go on and give the middle class the ability to deduct up to $10,000 a year in the cost of college tuition. Now, that is a tremendous life-saving change which will help people carry on their education and allow them to develop the kinds of skills that will help them succeed in the hi-tech economy of today."}

If you look at our proposal, we take half of the projected surplus and set it aside for Social Security. Over $2.4 trillion. We take roughly a fourth of it for other urgent priorities such as Medicare reform and education, several of these other key programs we want to support. And we take roughly one-fourth of it and return it in the form of a tax cut to the American taxpayer. We think it\u2019s extraordinarily important to do that. It is a fundamental difference between our two approaches. If you look, frankly, by our numbers and the numbers of the Senate Budget Committee, which has totaled up all the promises that Vice President Gore has made during the course of the campaign, they are some $900 billion in spending over and above that surplus already and we still have a month to go in the campaign. The fact is that the program that we put together we think is very responsible. Suggestion that somehow all of it is going for tax cuts isn\u2019t true. Another way to look at it is over the course of the next ten years we\u2019ll collect roughly $25 trillion in revenue. We want to take about 5% of that and return that to the American taxpayer in the form of tax relief. We have the highest level of taxation now we\u2019ve had since World War II. The average American family is paying about 40% in federal, state and local taxes. We think it is appropriate to return to the American people so that they can make choices themselves in how that money ought to be spent; whether on education, retirement or on paying their bills. It is their choice and it is their prerogative. We want to give them the opportunity to make those kinds of choices for themselves and we think this is a totally reasonable approach."}

With all due respect, the Senate Budget Committee estimates that Dick Cheney has just referred to are the estimates of the partisan Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee. We\u2019re using the numbers presented by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. We start with an agreement which is this surplus in the Social Security fund should be locked up and used for Social Security. That\u2019s where the agreement ends. We also agree and believe and pledge that the surplus in the Medicare trust fund should also be locked up with a sign on it that says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153politicians keep your hands off.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Our opponents do not do that. In fact, they raid the Medicare trust fund to pay for, well, their tax cut and other programs that they can\u2019t afford because they\u2019ve spent so much on the tax cut. Let me come back to the remaining $1.8 trillion that we both talked about. The numbers show that $1.6 trillion goes to the big tax cut which, as Al Gore said the other night, sends 43% to the top 1%. Worse than that, when you add on the other spending programs that our opponents have committed to, plus the cost of their plan to privatize Social Security, by our calculations they\u2019re $1.1 trillion in debt. That means we go back down the road to higher interest rates, to higher unemployment, to a kind of self-tax increase on every American family. Because when interest rates go up, so, too, do the cost of mortgage payments, car payments, student loans, credit card transactions. So if we\u2019ve learned anything over the last eight years, it is that one of the most important things the government can do, the federal government, probably the most important, is to be fiscally responsible. And that\u2019s why Al Gore and I are committed to balancing the budget every year. In fact, the paying off the debt by the year 2012, when by our calculation our opponent\u2019s economic plan still leaves America $2.8 trillion in debt."}

It\u2019s important to understand the things we\u2019re trying to change and address in the course of the campaign and what our agenda is for the future, our plans are for the future, focus very much about giving as much control as we can to individual Americans, be they men or women, be they single or married, as much control as possible over their own lives, especially in the area of taxation. We want to make certain that the American people have the ability to keep more of what they earn and then they can get to decide how to spend it. The proposal we have from Al Gore, basically, doesn\u2019t do that. It in effect lays out some 29 separate tax credits. If you live your life the way they want you to live your life, if you behave in a certain way, you qualify for a tax credit and at that point you get some relief. Bottom line, though, is 50 million American taxpayers out there get no advantages at all out of the Gore tax proposal, whereas under the Bush plan everybody who pays taxes will get tax relief."}

I want to clarify it briefly if I can. The first thing is the tax relief program that we\u2019ve proposed, one of the many tax credits for the middle class includes a $500 tax credit for stay-at-home moms just as a way of saying we understand that you are performing a service for our society. We want you to have that tax credit. Second, the number of 50 million Americans not benefitting from our tax cut program is absolutely wrong. It\u2019s an estimate done on an earlier form of our tax cut program and it\u2019s just plain wrong. And secondly, although Governor Bush says that his tax cut program, large as it is, gives a tax cut to everybody, as the newspapers indicated earlier this week, the Joint Committee on Taxation, again a nonpartisan group in Congress, says that 27 million Americans don\u2019t get what the governor said they would in the tax program. Al Gore and I want to live within our means. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to give it all away in one big tax cut and certainly not to the 1% of the public that doesn\u2019t need it now. We\u2019re focusing our tax cut on the middle class in the areas they tell us they need it. Tax credits for better and more expensive child care, tax credits for middle class families that don\u2019t have health insurance from their employers. The tax deduction I talked about earlier. Very exciting deduction for up to $10,000 a year in the cost of a college tuition. A $3,000 tax credit for the cost \u2014 well, actually for a family member who stays home with a parent or grandparent who is ill. And a very exciting tax credit program that I hope I\u2019ll have a chance to talk about later, Bernie, that encourages savings by people early in life and any time in life by having the federal government match savings for the 75 million Americans who make $100,000 or less up to $2,000 a year. Very briefly, if a young couple making $50,000 a year saves $1,000, the government will put another $1,000 in that account. By the time they retire, they\u2019ll not only have guaranteed Social Security, but more than $200,000 in that retirement fund. Now, that\u2019s \u2014"}

Governor Bush and I have emphasized while, while we are clearly both pro-life, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we believe. We want to reduce the incidence of abortion on our society. Many on the pro-choice side have said the same thing. Even Bill Clinton has advocated reducing abortion to make it as rare as possible. With respect to the question of RU-486, we believe that \u2014 of course, that it\u2019s recently been approved by the FDA. That really was a question of whether or not it was safe to be used by women. They didn\u2019t address the sort of the question of whether or not there should or should not be abortion in the society so much as evaluate that particular drug. What we would like to be able to do is to look for ways to reach across the divide between the two points of view and find things that we can do together to reduce the incidence of abortion. Such things as promoting adoption as an alternative. Encouraging parental notification. And we also think banning the horrific practice of partial birth abortions is an area where there could be agreement. Congress has twice passed by overwhelming margins, a significant number of votes from both parties, the ban on partial birth abortions. Twice it\u2019s been vetoed by Bill Clinton and Al Gore. We would hope eventually they would recognize that\u2019s not a good position for them to be in. With respect to the RU-486 proposal, at this stage I haven\u2019t looked in particular at that particular piece of legislation. Governor Bush made it clear the other night he did not anticipate that he would be able to go in and direct the FDA to reverse course on that particular issue, primarily because the decision they made was on the drug, not the question of whether or not it would support abortion."}

I hope it marks the end of Milosevic. I think probably more than anything else it\u2019s a victory for the Serbian people. They\u2019ve taken to the streets to support their democracy, to support their vote. In some respects this is a continuation of a process that began ten years ago all across eastern Europe and has only now arrived in Serbia. We saw it in Germany, we saw it in Rumania, we saw it in Czechoslovakia, as the people of eastern Europe rose up and made their claim for freedom. And I think we all admire that. I think with respect to how this process has been managed most recently, we want to do everything we can to support Mr. Milosevic\u2019s departure. Certainly, though, that would not involve committing U.S. troops. I do think it\u2019s noteworthy that there appears to be an effort underway to get the Russians involved. I noted the other night, for example, Tuesday night at the debate in Boston, Governor Bush suggested exactly that we ought to try to get the Russians involved to exercise some leverage over the Serbians. It\u2019s now clear from the press that, in fact, that\u2019s exactly what they were doing. It\u2019s \u2014 Governor Bush was correct in his assessment and his recommendation. He has supported the administration on Kosovo. He lobbied actively against passage of the Byrd-Warner provision which would have set a specific deadline, one he felt was too soon, for forcing the U.S. troops out. He\u2019s been supportive of the policy that we\u2019ve seen with respect to Yugoslavia. And I think he deserves a lot of credit for that. I would go beyond that. I think this is an opportunity for the United States to test President Putin of Russia. That in fact now is the time we ought to find out whether he\u2019s committed to democracy. Whether or not he\u2019s willing to support the forces of freedom and democracy diplomatically there in the area of eastern Europe. And it\u2019s a test for him whether he represents the old guard in the Soviet Union. One of the most important challenges we face as a nation is how we manage that process of integrating those 150 million eastern Europeans into the security and economic framework of Europe."}

The reason we have a military is to be able to fight and win wars. And to maintain with sufficient strength so that would-be adversaries are deterred from ever launching a war in the first place. I think that the administration has, in fact, in this area failed in a major responsibility. We\u2019ve seen a reduction in our forces far beyond anything that was justified by the end of the Cold War. At the same time we\u2019ve seen a rapid expansion of our commitments around the world as troops have been sent hither and yon. There was testimony before the Joint Chiefs of Staff before the Armed Services Committee that pointed out a lot of these problems. For example General Mike Ryan of the Air Force with 40% fewer aircraft, he\u2019s now undertaking three times as many deployments on a regular basis as he had to previously. We\u2019re overcommitted and underresourced. This has had some other unfortunate effects. I saw a letter the other day from a young captain stationed in Fort Bragg, a graduate of West Point in \u201995 getting ready to get out of the service because he\u2019s only allowed to train with his troops when fuel is available for the vehicles and only allowed to fire their weapons twice a year. He\u2019s concerned that if he had to send them into combat it would mean lives lost. That is a legitimate concern, this is a very important area. The fact that the U.S. military is worse off today than it was eight years ago. Major responsibility for us in the future, a high priority for myself and Governor Bush to rebuild the U.S. military and to give them the resources they need to do the job we ask them to do for us and give them good leadership."}

What I\u2019m saying now I\u2019m basing on serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee talking to exactly the people Dick Cheney has mentioned, the Secretary of Defense, the Chiefs of Staff. I\u2019ve visited our fighting forces around the world. I\u2019m telling you that we are ready to meet any contingency that might arise. The good news here and the interesting news is that we have met our recruitment targets in each of the services this year. In fact, in the areas where our opponents have said we are overextended, such as the Balkans, the soldiers there have a higher rate of re-enlistment than anywhere else in the service because they feel a sense of purpose, a sense of mission. In fact, this administration has begun to transform the American military to take it away from being a Cold War force to prepare it to meet the threats of the new generation of tomorrow, of weapons of mass destruction, of ballistic missiles, terrorism, cyber warfare. The fact is that Governor Bush recommended in his major policy statement on the military earlier this year that we skip the next generation of military equipment; helicopters, submarines, tactical air fighters, all the rest. That would really cripple our readiness. Exactly the readiness that Dick Cheney is talking about. Al Gore and I are committed to continuing this acquisition program, transforming the military. There\u2019s still fewer people in uniform today, but person-to-person, person-by-person, unit-by-unit, this is the most powerful and effective military, not only in the world today, but in the history of the world. And again, Al Gore and I will do whatever is necessary to keep it that way."}

Numerous administrations going back certainly to World War II have had to wrestle with the problem of what should happen to the Middle East. We made significant breakthroughs, I think, at the end of the Bush administration because of the Gulf War. In effect, we had joined together with Arab allies and done enormous damage to the Iraqi armed forces. Iraq was the biggest military threat to Israel. By virtue of the end of the Cold War, the Soviets were no longer a factor. They used to fish in troubled waters whenever they had the opportunity in the Middle East. With the end of the Soviet Union, the implosion of the empire, that created a vacuum if you will, and made it easier for us to operate there. We were able to, I think, reassure both Arabs and Israelis would play a major role there. We have the ability and the will to deploy forces if we had to, to engage in military operations to help our friends and oppose our foes. We were able to convene them in a conference. The first time Arab and Israelis sat down face-to-face and began this process of trying to move the peace process forward. I think also a lot of credit goes to some great men like Yitzak Rabin. His tragic passing was of great consequence, a great tragedy for everybody who cares about peace in the Middle East. He was a man who had the military stature to be able to confidently persuade the Israelis to take risks for peace. I think Barak has tried to same thing. I hope that we can get this resolved as soon as possible. My guess is the next administration is going to be the one that is going to have to come to grips with the current state of affairs there. I think it\u2019s very important that we have an administration where we have a president with firm leadership who has the kind of track record of dealing straight with people, of keeping his word so friends and allies both respect us and our adversaries fear us."}

I must say, I don\u2019t think a political campaign is the occasion to declare exactly what we would do in that case. I think that\u2019s a matter of such critical national security importance that it ought to be left to the Commander in Chief, leaders of the military, Secretary of State to make that kind of decision without the heat of a political campaign. The fact is that we will not enjoy real stability in the Middle East until Saddam Hussein is gone. The Gulf War was a great victory. And incidentally, Al Gore and I were two of the ten Democrats in the Senate who crossed party lines to support President Bush and Secretary Cheney in that war. We\u2019re both very proud we did that. But, the war did not end with a total victory. Saddam Hussein remained there. As a result, we have had almost ten years now of instability. We have continued to operate almost all of this time military action to enforce a no-fly zone. We have been struggling with Saddam about the inspectors. We ought to do, and we\u2019re doing everything we can to get the inspectors back in there. But in the end there\u2019s not going to be peace until he goes. And that\u2019s why I was proud to co-sponsor the Iraq Liberation Act with Senator Trent Lott why I have kept in touch with the indigenous Iraqi opposition, broad based, to Saddam Hussein. The Vice President met with them earlier this year. We are supporting them in their efforts and will continue to support them until the Iraqi people rise up and do what the people of Serbia have done in the last few days, get rid of a despot.

The Social Security system is in trouble. It\u2019s been a fantastic program and has been there for 65 years that has provided benefits for senior citizens over that period of time. For my parents. It means a great deal to millions of Americans. And Governor Bush and I want to make absolutely certain that the first thing we do is guarantee the continuation of those payments, those benefits and keep those promises that were made. But if you look down the road, you say you\u2019re 30 years old today, and I have two daughters about that age. They seriously question whether or not there will be any system left for them. That\u2019s because the demographics that work out there, it\u2019s almost an iron law. They know how many people there are, when they reach retirement, we know when the baby boom generation is coming along, how long they will live after that, it will drive the system into bankruptcy unless we reform and deal with it. The reform we would like to offer is to allow our young people to begin to take a portion of the payroll tax, 2% of it, and invest it in a personal retirement account. That does several things. First of all, it gives them a stake in the Social Security system. That becomes their property. They own it. They can pass it on to their kids if they want. They don\u2019t have that kind of equity in Social Security today. Secondly, we can generate a higher return off that investment than you get in the existing system. Today you get about a 2% return of what you pay into Social Security. We think we can generate at least 6%. At least three times what we\u2019re able to get now. And long-term by generating a bigger return, we\u2019ll put additional funds into the system that will help us survive that crunch that is otherwise going to hit in the future. Bottom line is there\u2019s a choice here. With respect to Al Gore and Joe\u2019s plan, they don\u2019t reform Social Security. They add another huge obligation on top of it that future generations will have to pay. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t touch the basic system itself. They don\u2019t reform it and don\u2019t save it.

I\u2019m proud of my service for 25 years, but also proud I had the opportunity to go out and get a different experience. And you\u2019re absolutely right. People are fed up. They\u2019ve had enough with the bickering and the partisanship that seems to characterize the debate that goes on in the nation\u2019s capital. I\u2019ve seen it done differently though. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen it in Texas. I\u2019ve watched George Bush. And one of the reasons I was eager to sign on when he asked me to become his running mate is because I\u2019ve been so tremendously impressed with what he\u2019s done as the Governor of Texas. He came in when he had a legislature completely controlled by the other party. He managed to reach across partisan lines and unite republicans, and democrats and independents and put them to work to achieve good things for the State of Texas. Partly because he didn\u2019t point the finger of blame looking for scapegoats he was quick to share the credit. He ended up, as a result of that activity of his first term, having the top Democrat in the state, Bob Bulloch, endorse George Bush for reelection. It\u2019s possible to change the tone. It is possible to get people to work together and to begin to focus on achieving results. I think it will take new leadership. I don\u2019t think you can do it, with all due respect to Al Gore, with somebody who spent all the last 24 years in that Washington environment and who campaigns on the basis of castigating others, pointing the finger of blame at others in terms of blaming business or various groups for failings. I think you have to be able to reach out and work together and build coalitions. I think George W. Bush has done it in Texas and can do it at the national level."}

I have tried very hard in my career to call them as I see them and work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get things done.

Don Nichols on the International Religious Freedom Act. If I go on much longer I\u2019ll get in trouble with my own party. That\u2019s the way things get done. I\u2019m proud of those partnerships. Let me say a word about Al Gore. In his years in the house and Senate, he formed similar bipartisan partnerships. If you look back over the last eight years, the most significant accomplishments of this administration in which Al Gore was centrally involved were the result, most of them, of bipartisan agreements. After all, the Welfare Reform Act, which Al Gore promised to lead the effort on to get people off of welfare to set time limits, to get people to enjoy the dignity of work. That was a bipartisan act that was adopted. The Anti-Crime Act that has helped to lower crime more than 20% in our country was also bipartisan. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 which was critical to getting our economy to the point and our government to the point of unprecedented surplus we enjoy today also was bipartisan, and Al Gore was involved. I would say that\u2019s exactly the kind of bipartisan leadership that he and I can bring to Washington to get things done."}

We still have not only the problems we\u2019re talking about here tonight in terms of the problems you mentioned in profiling, but beyond that, we still have an achievement gap in education, income differentials, differences in life span.

I\u2019ve been thinking about it. I want to explain what my thoughts have been. Maybe I should begin this answer by going back to the beginning of the country and the Declaration of Independence which says there at the outset that all of us are created equal and that we\u2019re endowed not by any bunch of politicians or philosophers, but by our Creator, with those inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. At the beginning of our history, that promise that ideal was not realized or experienced by all Americans, but over time since then we have extended the orbit of that promise. In our time at the frontier of that effort is extending those kinds of rights to gay and lesbian Americans who are citizens of this country and children of the same awesome God just as much as any of the rest of us are. That\u2019s why I have been an original co-sponsor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act which aims to prevent gay and lesbian Americans who are otherwise qualified from being discriminated against in the workplace. And I\u2019ve sponsored other pieces of legislation and taken other actions that carry out that ideal. The question you pose is a difficult one for this reason. It confronts or challenges the traditional notion of marriage as being limited to a heterosexual couple, which I support. I must say I\u2019m thinking about this, because I have friends who are in gay and lesbian partnerships who said to me, isn\u2019t it fair. We don\u2019t have legal rights to inheritance, visitation when one partner is ill, to health care benefits. That\u2019s why I\u2019m thinking about it. My mind is open to taking some action that will address those elements of unfairness while respecting the traditional religious and civil institution of marriage."}

I have had extraordinary opportunities, thanks again to those folks back home in Connecticut, \u00c2 as a state senator, attorney general trying to enforce the law to protect them and the environment and consumers, and to litigate on behalf of humans rights. And for the last 12 years as a member of the Senate of the United States focusing on national security questions, environmental protection, economic growth and values. But perhaps what I most bring is a friendship and shared values and shared priorities with Al Gore. I have tremendous respect for Al Gore. I\u2019ve known him for 15 years. He\u2019s an outstanding person as a public official and as a private person. His life is built on his faith. It\u2019s devoted to his family. He volunteered for service in Vietnam from the beginning. In Congress he\u2019s been willing to take on the big interests and fight for average people. As vice president I think he\u2019s been the most effective vice president in the history of the United States and he has the right program to use the prosperity all the American people have earned to help particularly hard working middle-class families raise up their children to enjoy a better life. I think that\u2019s what this is all about, why I\u2019m so proud to be his running mate."}

And believe me, if anybody has devoted his life to respecting the role of religion in American life and understands that Americans from the beginning of our history have turned to God for strength and purpose, it\u2019s me. And any offense that was done, I apologize for. I thought that humor was unacceptable. Let me come to the question of Hollywood and then answer the general question. Al Gore and I have felt for a long time, first as parents and then only second as public officials, that we cannot let America\u2019s parents stand alone in this competition that they feel they\u2019re in with Hollywood to raise their own kids and give their kids the faith and values they want to give them. I\u2019ve been a consistent crusader on that behalf. John McCain and I actually requested the Federal Trade Commission report that came out three or four weeks ago which proved conclusively that the entertainment industry was marketing adult-rated products to our children. That is just not acceptable. One finding was that they were actually using 10 to 12-year-olds to test screen adult-rated products. When that report came out, Al Gore and I said to the entertainment industry, stop it. If you don\u2019t stop it in six months, we\u2019ll ask the Federal Trade Commission to take action against you. There was no similar strong response from our opponents. We repeated that message when we went to Los Angeles. I repeat it today. We won\u2019t stop until the entertainment industry stops marketing its products to our children. Al Gore and I \u2014 I\u2019m out. Maybe I can come back to it."}

I must say, I wish one more person were here to watch and that is my dad, who died 15 years ago. If my dad were here, I would have the opportunity to tell him that he was right when he taught me that in America, if you have faith, work hard and play by the rules, there is nothing you cannot achieve. And here I am even the son of a man who started working the night shift on a bakery truck can end up being a candidate for Vice President of the United States. That says a lot about the character of this nation and the goodness of you, the American people. I will tell you that Hadassah and I have traveled around this country in the last couple of months and met thousands and thousands of parents just like our moms and dads, hard working middle-class people paying their taxes, doing the jobs to keep the country running. Trying so hard to teach their kids right from wrong and believing in their hearts that their kids can make it. I agree with them. But to make it they need a leader who will stand up and fight for them for good education, the best education in the world. For a sound retirement system, for prescription drug benefits for their parents. And for a government that is fiscally responsible, balances the budget. Keeps interest rates down so they can afford to buy a home or send their kids to college. To me Al Gore is that leader and will be that kind of president. You know, for 224 years Americans have dreamed bigger dreams and tried bolder solutions than any other people on earth. Now is not the time to settle for less than we can be. As good as things are today, Al Gore and I believe that with your help and God\u2019s help we can make the future of this good and blessed country even better. Thank you, God bless you and good night."}

I\u2019ve enjoyed the debate this evening. And thank the folks here at the Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done a tremendous job of making this possible. This is a very important decision you\u2019re going to make on November 7. We have a fundamental choice between whether or not we continue with our old ways of big government, high taxes and ever more intrusive bureaucracy, or whether we take a new course for a new era. Governor Bush and I want to pursue the new course. We want to reform the Social Security system to guarantee benefits will be there for our retired folks, as well as make it possible for our young people to invest a portion of their payroll tax into a retirement account that they\u2019ll control and give them greater control over their own lives. We want to reform the Medicare system to make certain the benefits are there for our senior citizens, but also to provide prescription drug coverage for them and give them a range of choices in terms of the kind of insurance we have. We want to reform the education system. We want to restore our public schools to the greatness they once represented so that every parent has the opportunity to choose what is best for their child and so that every child has an opportunity to share in the American dream. We also want to reform the tax code. We think it\u2019s very important now that we have a surplus, that a portion of that surplus go back to the people who earned it. It\u2019s not the government\u2019s money, it\u2019s your money. You\u2019re entitled to it, and we would like to see to it that we provide tax relief for everybody who pays taxes. Finally, we think it\u2019s very important to rebuild the U.S. military. The military is in trouble. The trends are in the wrong direction. The finest men and women in uniform that you\u2019ll find anyplace in the world but they deserve our support. They deserve the resources that we need to provide for them and they deserve good leadership. George Bush is the man to do this. I\u2019ve seen him do it in Texas. What we need is to be able to reach across the aisle. Put together coalitions of Republicans and Democrats and build the kinds of coalitions that will get something done, finally, in Washington. George Bush is good man, an honorable man, a man of great integrity. He will make a first rate president."}

Strong relations in Europe is in our nation\u2019s interest. I\u2019ve thought a lot about what it means to be the president. I also understand that an administration is not one person, but an administration is dedicated citizens who are called by the president to serve the country, to serve a cause greater than self, and so I\u2019ve thought about an administration of people who represent all America, but people who understand my compassionate and conservative philosophy. I haven\u2019t started naming names except for one person, and that\u2019s Mr. Richard Cheney who I thought did a great job the other night. He\u2019s a vice presidential nominee who represents \u2014 I think people got to see why I picked him. He\u2019s man of solid judgment and he\u2019s going to be a person to stand by my side. One of the things I\u2019ve done in Texas is I\u2019ve been able to put together a good team of people. I\u2019ve been able to set clear goals. The goals ought to be an education system that leaves no child behind, Medicare for our seniors, a Social Security system that\u2019s safe and secure, foreign policy that\u2019s in our nation\u2019s interest, and a strong military, and then bring people together to achieve those goals.

Like the vice president, I call on Chairman Arafat to have his people pull back to make the peace. I think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the Middle East. I want everybody to know should I be the president Israel\u2019s going to be our friend. I\u2019m going to stand by Israel. Secondly, that I think it\u2019s important to reach out to moderate Arab nations, like Jordan and Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. It\u2019s important to be friends with people when you don\u2019t need each other so that when you do there\u2019s a strong bond of friendship. And that\u2019s going to be particularly important in dealing not only with situations such as now occurring in Israel, but with Saddam Hussein. The coalition against Saddam has fallen apart or it\u2019s unraveling, let\u2019s put it that way. The sanctions are being violated. We don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s developing weapons of mass destruction. He better not be or there\u2019s going to be a consequence should I be the president. But it\u2019s important to have credibility and credibility is formed by being strong with your friends and resolute in your determination. One of the reasons why I think it\u2019s important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace to be able to say to the Saddam Hussein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of the world or the Iranians, don\u2019t dare threaten our friends. It\u2019s also important to keep strong ties in the Middle East, credible ties, because of the energy crisis we\u2019re now in. After all, a lot of the energy is produced from the Middle East, and so I appreciate what the administration is doing. I hope to get a sense of should I be fortunate to be the president how my administration will react to the Middle East."}

I know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations. But the fact is that that\u2019s the situation that was left when I got there. And we have maintained the sanctions. Now I want to go further. I want to give robust support to the groups that are trying to overthrow Saddam Hussein, and I know there are allegations that they\u2019re too weak to do it, but that\u2019s what they said about the forces that were opposing Milosevic in Serbia, and you know, the policy of enforcing sanctions against Serbia has just resulted in a spectacular victory for democracy just in the past week, and it seems to me that having taken so long to see the sanctions work there, building upon the policy of containment that was successful over a much longer period of time against the former Soviet Union in the communist block, seems a little early to declare that we should give up on the sanctions. I know the governor\u2019s not necessarily saying that but, you know, all of these flights that have come in, all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime, I\u2019m told, except for three where they notified, and they\u2019re trying to break out of the box, there\u2019s no question about it.

I didn\u2019t think he necessarily made the right decision to take land troops off the table right before we committed ourselves offensively, but nevertheless, it worked. The administration deserves credit for having made it work. It is important for NATO to have it work. It\u2019s important for NATO to be strong and confident and to help keep the peace in Europe. And one of the reasons I felt so strongly that the United States needed to participate was because of our relations with NATO, and NATO is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future. Now, there\u2019s more work to do. Remains to be seen, however, whether or not there\u2019s going to be a political settlement in Kosovo, and I certainly hope there is one. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m on record as saying at some point in time I hope our European friends become the peacekeepers in Bosnia and in the Balkans. I hope that they put the troops on the ground so that we can withdraw our troops and focus our military on fighting and winning war."}

When I was in the senate before I became vice president I was pushing for stronger action against Milosevic. He caused the death of so many people. He was the last communist party boss there and then he became a dictator that by some other label he was still essentially a communist dictator. And unfortunately now he is trying to reassert himself in Serbian politics. Already just today the members of his political party said that they were going to ignore the orders of the new president of Serbia, and that they question his legitimacy, and he\u2019s still going to try to be actively involved. He is an indicted war criminal. He should be held accountable. Now, I did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier, and maybe I have heard, maybe I have heard the previous statements wrong, Governor. In some of the discussions we\u2019ve had about when it\u2019s appropriate for the U.S. to use force around the world, at times the standards that you\u2019ve laid down have given me the impression that if it\u2019s something like a genocide taking place or what they called ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, that that alone would not be, that that wouldn\u2019t be the kind of situation that would cause you to think that the U.S. ought to get involved with troops. Now, have to be other factors involved for me to want to be involved. But by itself, that to me can bring into play a fundamental American strategic interest because I think it\u2019s based on our values. Now, have I got that wrong?"}

Fine. We did, actually, send troops into Rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures. My wife Tipper, who is here, actually went on a military plane with General Sholicatchvieli on one of those flights. But I think in retrospect we were too late getting in there. We could have saved more lives if we had acted earlier. But I do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason, Jim. One of the criteria that I think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military forces. If we tried everything else, if we have allies. In the Balkans we have allies, NATO, ready, willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden. In Africa we did not. Now, we have tried \u2014 our country has tried to create an Africa crisis response team there, and we\u2019ve met some resistance. We have had some luck with Nigeria, but in Sierra Leon, and now that Nigeria has become a democracy, and we hope it stays that way, then maybe we can build on that. But because we had no allies and because it was very unclear that we could actually accomplish what we would want to accomplish about putting military forces there, I think it was the right thing not to jump in, as heartbreaking as it was, but I think we should have come in much quicker with the humanitarian mission."}

The way I see it, the world is getting much closer together. Like it or not, we are now \u2014 the United States is now the natural leader of the world. All these other countries are looking to us. Now, just because we cannot be involved everywhere, and shouldn\u2019t be, doesn\u2019t mean that we should shy away from going in anywhere. Now, both of us are kind of, I guess, stating the other\u2019s position in a maximalist extreme way, but I think there is a difference here. This idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century, World War II. During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States. The lesson was that in the aftermath of World War I, we kind of turned our backs and left them to their own devices and they brewed up a lot of trouble that quickly became World War II. And acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did. We got intimately involved in building NATO and other structures there. We still have lots of troops in Europe. And what did we do in the late \u201940\u2019s and \u201950\u2019s and \u201960\u2019s? We were nation building. And it was economic. But it was also military. And the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there. We had civil administrators come in to set up their ways of building their towns back."}

I think a lot of times we just spend aid and say we feel better about it and it ends up being spent the wrong way, and there\u2019s some pretty egregious examples recently. One being Russia, where we had IMF loans that ended up in the pockets of a lot of powerful people and didn\u2019t help the nation. I think the IMF has got a role in the world, but I don\u2019t want to see the IMF out there as a way to say to world bankers, if you make a bad loan, we\u2019ll bail you out. It needs to be available for emergency situations. I thought the President did the right thing with Mexico and was very strongly supportive of the administration in Mexico.

I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s the role of the United States to walk into a country and say, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we do it this way, so should you.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d I think we can help. I know we\u2019ve got to encourage democracy in the marketplaces. But take Russia, for example. We went into Russia, we said here is some IMF money, and it ended up in Viktor Chemomyrdin\u2019s pocket, and others, and yet we played like there was reform. The only people that are going to reform Russia are Russia. They\u2019re going to have to make the decision themselves. Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and\/or entities invest capital, there\u2019s a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy. But Russia has to make the decision. We can work with them on security matters, for example, but it\u2019s their call to make. So I\u2019m not exactly sure where the vice president is coming from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we do it this way, so should you.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Now, we trust freedom. We know freedom is a powerful, powerful, powerful force, much bigger than the United States of America, as we saw recently in the Balkans. But maybe I misunderstand where you\u2019re coming from, Mr. Vice President, but I think the United States must be humble and must be proud and confident of our values, but humble in how we treat nations that are figuring out how to chart their own course."}

One of my concerns, though, is I don\u2019t want to federalize the local police forces. I want to \u2014 obviously in the egregious cases we need to enforce civil rights law, but we need to make sure that internal affairs divisions at the local level do their job and be given a chance to do their job.

But it\u2019s very important that we not overstep our bounds and I think most people \u2014 most police officers are good, dedicated, honorable citizens who are doing their job, putting their lives at risk who aren\u2019t bigoted or aren\u2019t prejudiced. I don\u2019t think they ought to be held guilty. But I do think we need to find out where racial profiling occurs and do something about it and say to the local folks, get it done.

So racial profiling isn\u2019t just an issue at local police forces. It\u2019s an issue throughout our society.

In public education when we just move children through the schools. My friend, Phyllis Hunter, is here. She had one of the greatest lines of all lines. She said, reading is the new civil right. She\u2019s right. And to make sure our society is as hopeful as it possibly can be, every single child in America must be educated. I mean every child. It starts with making sure every child learns to read. K-2 diagnostic testing so we know whether or not there\u2019s a deficiency. Curriculum that works and phonics needs to be an integral part of our reading curriculum. Intensive reading laboratories, teacher retraining. I mean, there needs to be a wholesale effort against racial profiling, which is illiterate children. We can do better in our public schools. We can close an achievement gap, and it starts with making sure we have strong accountability, Jim. One of the cornerstones of reform, and good reform, is to measure. Because when you measure you can ask the question, do they know? Is anybody being profiled? Is anybody being discriminated against? It becomes a tool, a corrective tool. And I believe the federal government must say that if you receive any money, any money from the federal government for disadvantaged children, for example, you must show us whether or not the children are learning. And if they are, fine. And if they\u2019re not, there has to be a consequence. And so to make sure we end up getting rid of basic structural prejudice is education. There is nothing more prejudiced than not educating a child."}

I will not do anything to affect the rights of hunters or sportsmen. I think that homeowners have to be respected and their right to have a gun if they wish to. The problem I see is that there are too many guns getting into the hands of children, and criminals, and people who, for whatever reason, some kind of history of stalking or domestic abuse really should not be able to get guns. I think these assault weapons are a problem. So I favor closing the gun show loophole. In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to close it, but then the majority in the House of Representatives went the other way. That\u2019s still pending. If we could get agreement on that, maybe they could pass that in the final days of this Congress. I think we ought to restore the three-day waiting period under the Brady Law. I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively. Some of the restrictions that have been placed by the Congress in the last couple of years. I think \u2014 in the last few years I think have been unfortunate. I think that we ought to make all schools gun free. Have a gun-free zone around every school in this country. I think that measures like these are important. Child safety trigger locks on a mandatory basis, and others."}

When you say loud and clear to somebody if you\u2019re going to carry a gun illegally, we\u2019re going to arrest you. If you\u2019re going to sell a gun illegally, you need to be arrested. If you commit a crime with a gun, there needs to be absolute certainty in the law. And that means that the local law enforcement officials need help at the federal level. Programs like Project Exile where the federal government intensifies arresting people who illegally use guns. And we haven\u2019t done a very good job of that at the federal level recently. And I\u2019m going to make it a priority. Secondly, I don\u2019t think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldn\u2019t have them. That\u2019s why I support instant background checks at gun shows. One of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not. In Texas I tried to do something innovative. There\u2019s a lot of talk about trigger locks being on guns sold in the future. I support that. But I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come and get one for free. So we\u2019re distributing in our State of Texas for free. I think we ought to raise the age at which a juvenile can carry a handgun from 18 to 21. I disagree with the vice president on this issue. He is for registration of guns. I think the only people that are going to show up to register or get a license \u2014 I guess licensing like a driver\u2019s license for a gun, the only people that are going to show up are law-abiding citizens. The criminal is not going to show up and say hey, give me my I.D. card. It\u2019s the law-abiding citizens who will do that.

You can\u2019t carry a gun into a school. And there ought to be a consequence when you do carry a gun into a school. But Columbine spoke to a larger issue. It\u2019s really a matter of culture. It\u2019s a culture that somewhere along the line we\u2019ve begun to disrespect life. Where a child can walk in and have their heart turned dark as a result of being on the Internet and walk in and decide to take somebody else\u2019s life? So gun laws are important, no question about it, but so is loving children, and character education classes, and faith-based programs being a part of after-school programs. Some desperate child needs to have somebody put their arm around them and say, we love you. So there\u2019s a \u2014 this is a society that \u2014 of ours that\u2019s got to do a better job of teaching children right from wrong. And we can enforce law. But there seems to be a lot of preoccupation on \u2014 not certainly only in this debate, but just in general on law. But there\u2019s a larger law. Love your neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself. And that\u2019s where our society must head if we\u2019re going to be a peaceful and prosperous society."}

But I don\u2019t think that we can ignore the role played by guns. I mean, the fact is that there \u2014 even though no state wants them, there are guns in some schools. And the reason it\u2019s so difficult for schools to control that is because in recent years there has been a flood of cheap handguns that are so widely available that kids are finding ways to get ahold of them. And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands."}

For those what I think we need to do is to develop an investment-type vehicle that would be an incentive for them to invest, like medical savings accounts with rollover capacity. In other words, you say to a youngster, it will be in your financial interest to start saving for future illness, but for the working folks that do want to have health care that can\u2019t afford it, a couple of things we need to do. One, we need more community health centers. I\u2019ve developed \u2014 put out money in my budget to expand community health centers all around the country. These are places where people can get primary care. Secondly \u2014 and they\u2019re good. They\u2019re very important parts of the safety net of health care. Secondly, that you get a $2,000 rebate from the government if you\u2019re a family of $30,000 or less \u2014 it scales down as you get higher \u2014 that you can use to purchase health care in the private markets. It will be a huge down payment for a pretty darn good system. If you allow \u2014 also allow \u2014 convince states to \u2014 allow states to allow the mother to match some of the children\u2019s health insurance money with it, the pool purchasing power. And to make health care more affordable, allow business associations like the National Federal of Independent Business or the Chamber of Commerce or the National Restaurant Association to write association plans across jurisdictional lines so that small businesses have got the capacity to have national pooling to drive the cost of insurance down. I think that\u2019s the very best way to go. It empowers people, it trusts people, it makes \u2014 and it\u2019s a practical way to encourage people to purchase health care insurance."}

I would. Now, but here is why it\u2019s directly relevant, Jim. Because by his own budget numbers, his proposals for spending on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy are more than the new spending proposals that he has made for health care and education and national defense all combined.

Already many people see the strange weather conditions that the old timers say they\u2019ve never seen before in their lifetimes. And what\u2019s happening is the level of pollution is increasing significantly. Now, here is the good news, Jim. If we take the leadership role and build the new technologies, like the new kinds of cars and trucks that Detroit is itching to build, then we can create millions of good new jobs by being first into the market with these new kinds of cars and trucks and other kinds of technologies. You know the Japanese are breathing down our necks on this. They\u2019re moving very rapidly because they know that it is a fast-growing world market. Some of these other countries, particularly in the developing world, their pollution is much worse than anywhere else and their people want higher standards of living. And so they\u2019re looking for ways to satisfy their desire for a better life and still reduce pollution at the same time. I think that holding onto the old ways and the old argument that the environment and the economy are in conflict is really outdated. We have to be bold. We have to provide leadership. Now it\u2019s true that we disagree on this. The governor said that he doesn\u2019t think this problem is necessarily caused by people. He\u2019s for letting the oil companies into the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Houston has just become the smoggiest city in the country. And Texas is number one in industrial pollution.

This race is about values, it\u2019s about change, it\u2019s about giving choices to the American people. And education is my number one priority, because I think that it\u2019s the most important big major change that we can bring in our country. I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students. I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also. The difference is that while my plan starts with new accountability and maintains local control, it doesn\u2019t stop there. Because I want to give new choices to parents. To send their kids to college with a $10,000 tax deduction for college tuition per child per year. I want to reduce the size of the classrooms in this country. For one basic reason, so that students can get more one-on-one time with teachers. And the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers. I\u2019ve a plan in my budget to recruit 100,000 new, highly qualified teachers and to help local school districts build new schools. I think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and pre-school. Now, here is how that connects with all the rest of what we\u2019ve been talking about. If you have \u2014 if you squander the surplus on a huge tax cut that goes mostly to those at the top, then you can\u2019t make education the top priority. If the tax cut is your number one, two, three and four priority, you can\u2019t do education. You can\u2019t do both. You have to choose. I choose education and health care, the environment and retirement security, and I ask for your support."}

I would like to unite this country to get an agenda done that will speak to the hopes and aspirations of the future. I want to have an education system that sets high standards, local control of schools and strong accountability. No child should be left behind in America. I want to make sure we rebuild our military to keep the peace. I worry about morale in today\u2019s military. The warning signs are clear. It is time to have a new commander in chief who will rebuild the military, pay our men and women more, make sure they\u2019re housed better and have a focused mission for our military. Once and for all, I want to do something about Medicare. This issue has been too long on the table because it\u2019s been a political issue. It\u2019s time to bring folks together to say that all seniors will get prescription drug coverage. I want to do something about Social Security.

But younger workers, in order to make sure the system exists tomorrow, younger workers ought to be able to take some of your own money and invest it in safe securities to get a better rate of return on that money. And finally, I do believe in tax relief. I believe we can set our priorities. I don\u2019t believe, like the vice president does, in huge government. I believe in limited government. By having a limited government and a focused government, we can send some of the money back to the people who pay the bills.

Tipper and I were good friends with Mel and Randy, and I know that all of us here want to extend our sympathy and condolences to Jean and the family and to the Sifford family. And I would just like to say that this debate in a way is a living tribute to Mel Carnahan because he loved the vigorous discussion of ideas in our democracy. He was a fantastic governor of Missouri. This state became one of the top five in the nation for health care coverage for children under his leadership. One of the best in advancing all kinds of benefits for children to grow up healthy and strong. And of course, this debate also takes place at a time when the tragedy of the USS Cole is on our minds and hearts and insofar as the memorial service is tomorrow, I would like to also extend sympathy to the families of those who have died and those who are still missing, and the injured. Now, Mr. Hankins, I think that the situation that you describe has gotten completely out of hand. Doctors are giving prescriptions, they\u2019re recommending treatments, and then their recommendations are being overruled by HMOs and insurance companies. That is unacceptable. I support a strong national patient\u2019s bill of rights. It is actually a disagreement between us, a national law that is pending on this, the Dingle-Norwood bill, a bipartisan bill, is one that I support and that the governor does not."}

I want to streamline the approval of the competing generic drugs and the new kinds of treatments that can compete with them so we bring the price down for everybody. Now, briefly, let me tell you how my prescription drug plan works. The governor talked about Medicare. I propose a real prescription drug benefit under Medicare for all seniors, all seniors, and here\u2019s how it works. You pick your own doctor, and nobody can take that away from you. The doctor chooses the prescription that you need and nobody can overrule your doctor. You go to your own pharmacy and then Medicare pays half the price. If you\u2019re poor, they pay all of it. If you have extraordinarily high cost, then they pay all over $4,000 out-of-pocket. And I\u2019ll bring new competition to bring the price down.

We\u2019ve spent 65 years now on the development of a hybrid system, partly private, partly public, and 85% of our people have health insurance, 15% don\u2019t. That adds up to 44 million people. That is a national outrage. We have got to get health coverage for those who do not have it and we\u2019ve got to improve the quality for those who do with a patient\u2019s bill of rights that\u2019s real and that works, the Dingle-Norwood bill, and we have got to fill in the gaps in coverage by finally bringing parity for the treatment of mental illness, because that\u2019s been left out. We have got to deal with long-term care. Now, here are the steps that I would take, first of all. I will make a commitment to bring health care coverage of high quality that is affordable to every single child in America within four years. And then we\u2019ll fill other gaps by covering the parents of those children when the family is poor or up to two and a half times the poverty rate. I want to give a tax credit for the purchase of individual health insurance plans. I want to give small business employers a tax credit, 25%, to encourage the providing of health insurance for the employees in small businesses. I want to give seniors who are, well, the near elderly, I don\u2019t like that term because I am just about in that category, but those 55 to 65 ought to be able to buy into Medicare for premiums that are reasonable and fair and significantly below what they have to get now. Now, we have a big difference on this. And you need to know the record here. Under Governor Bush, Texas has sunk to be 50th out of 50 in health care \u2014 in health insurance for their citizens. Last week he said that they were spending 3.7 billion dollars, or 4.7 billion dollars on this."}

I wish I knew the law because I would darn sure sign it. I wish I knew the law that said all of us would be good parents. One of the things the next president must do is to remind people that if we are going to have a responsible period in America, that each of us must love our children with all our heart and all our soul. I happened to believe strong accountability encourages parental involvement, though. I think when you measure and post results on the Internet or in the town newspapers, most parents say wait a minute, my child\u2019s school isn\u2019t doing what I want it to do and, therefore, become involved in education. I recognize there are some who just don\u2019t seem to care. But there are a lot of parents who feel like everything is going well in their child\u2019s school, and all of a sudden they wake up and realize that wait a minute, standards aren\u2019t being met. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so strong for accountability. I believe we ought to measure a lot, three, four, five, six, seven, eighth grade. We do so in my state of Texas. One of the good things we\u2019ve gone in Texas is we have strong accountability because you can\u2019t cure unless you know. You can\u2019t solve a problem unless you diagnose it. I strongly believe that one of the best things to encourage parental involvement also is to know that the classrooms will be safe and secure. That\u2019s why I support a teacher liability act at the federal level, that says if a teacher or principal upholds reasonable standards of classroom discipline they can\u2019t be sued. They can\u2019t be sued. I think parents will be more involved with education when they know their children\u2019s classrooms are safe and secure as well. I also believe that we need to say to people that if you cannot meet standards, there has to be a consequence. Instead of just comes the soft bigotry of low expectations, that there has to be a consequence. We can\u2019t continue to shuffle children through school. And one of the consequences to allow parents to have different choices."}

I\u2019d like to start by telling you what my vision is. I see a day in the United States of America where all of our public schools are considered excellent, world class. Where there are no failing schools, where the classrooms are small enough in size, number of students, so that the teacher can spend enough one-on-one time with each student. Now that means recruiting new teachers for the public schools. It means in my plan hiring bonuses to get 100,000 new teachers in the public schools within the next four years. It means also helping local school districts that sometimes find the parents of school age children outvoted on bond issues, to give them some help with interest-free bonding authority so that we can build new schools and modernize the classrooms. We need to give teachers the training and professional development that they need, including a paid time off to go visit the classroom of a master teacher to pick up some new skills. I want to give every middle-class family a $10,000 a year tax deduction for college tuition so that middle-class families will always be able to send their kids on to college. I want to work for universal free school because we know from all the studies that the youngsters learn, kids learn more in the first few years of life than any where else. Now, I said there was a contrast. Governor Bush is for vouchers, and in his plan he proposes to drain more money, more taxpayer money out of the public schools for private school vouchers than all of the money that he proposes in his entire budget for public schools themselves. And only one in 20 students would be eligible for these vouchers, and they wouldn\u2019t even pay the full tuition to private school. I think that\u2019s a mistake. I don\u2019t think we should give up on the private schools and leave kids trapped in failing schools. I think we \u2014 I think we should make it the number one priority to make our schools the best in the world, all of them."}

If you want to do a voucher program in Missouri, fine. I strongly believe in local control of schools. I\u2019m a governor of state and I don\u2019t like it when the federal government tells us what to do. I believe in local control of schools. But here\u2019s what I said. I\u2019ve said to the extent we spend federal money on disadvantaged children, we want the schools to show us whether or not the children are learning. What\u2019s unreasonable about that? We expect there to be standards met and we expect there to be measurement. And if we find success we\u2019ll praise it. But when we find children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach, instead of saying oh, this is okay in America just to shuffle poor kids through schools, there has to be a consequence. And the consequence is that federal portion or federal money will go to the parent, so the parent can go to a tutoring program or another public school or another private school. You see, there has to be a consequence. We\u2019ve got a society that says hey, the status quo is fine, just move them through. And guess who suffers."}

Under my plan, if a school is failing, we work with the states to give them the authority and the resources to close down that school and reopen it right away with a new principal, a new faculty, a turn-around team of specialists who know what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s based on the plan of Governor Jim Hunt in North Carolina, and it works great."}

It\u2019s ironic that there are now \u2014 there is now a smaller percentage of the voters made up of parents with children than ever in American history because of the aging of our population, but at the same time we\u2019ve got the largest generation of students in public schools ever. More than 90% of America\u2019s children go to public schools. And it\u2019s the largest number ever this year and they\u2019ll break the record next year and every year for ten years running. We\u2019ve got to do something about this. And local \u2014 it\u2019s not enough to leave it up to the local school districts. They\u2019re not able to do it and our future depends upon it.

And again, I want to make it possible for all middle-class families to send their kids to college and more Pell grants for those who are in the lower income groups also, and then I want to make sure that we have job training on top of that and lifelong learning, but it all starts with the public school teachers. My proposal gives $10,000 hiring bonuses for those teachers who are \u2014 who get certified to teach in the areas where they\u2019re most needed. Now, accountability, we basically agree on accountability. My plan requires testing of all students. It also requires something that Governor Bush\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t. It requires testing of all new teachers, including in the subjects that they teach. We have to start treating teachers like the professionals that they are, and give them the respect and the kind of quality of life that will draw more people into teaching because we need a lot more teachers."}

And there\u2019s just not going to be enough money. I have been a governor of a big state, I have made education my number one priority. That\u2019s what governors ought to do. They ought to say this is the most important thing we do as a state. The federal government puts about 6% of the money up. They put about, you know, 60% of the strings where you have to fill out the paperwork. I don\u2019t know if you have to be a paperwork filler-outer, but most of it\u2019s because of the federal government. What I want to do is to send flexibility and authority to the local folks so you can choose what to do with the money. One size does not fit all. I worry about federalizing education if I were you. I believe strongly that the federal government can help, we need to fund Headstart. We need to have accountability. The Vice President\u2019s plan does not have annual accountability, third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade. We need to demand on results. I believe strongly in a teacher protection act like I mentioned. I hear from teachers all the time about the lawsuits and the threats, respect in the classroom. Part of it\u2019s because you can\u2019t \u2014 you can\u2019t control the classroom. You can\u2019t have a consequence for somebody without fear of getting sued under federal law. So I\u2019m going to ask the Congress to pass a teacher protection act. So I believe in flexibility, I believe in a national reading initiative for local districts to access with K through 2 diagnostic testing, curriculum that works, phonics works, by the way, it needs to be a part of our curriculum. There needs to be flexibility for teacher training and teacher hiring with federal money. The federal government can be a part, but don\u2019t fall prey to all this stuff about money here and money there because education is really funded at the local level. 94% comes from the local level."}

Look, the problem is that under Governor Bush\u2019s plan, $1.6 trillion tax cut, mostly to the wealthy, under his own budget numbers, he proposes spending more money for a tax cut just for the wealthiest 1% than all the new money he budgets for education, health care and national defense combined. Now under my plan we\u2019ll balance the budget every year. I\u2019m not just saying this. I\u2019m not just talking. I have helped to balance the budget for the first time in 30 years, paid down the debt. And under my plan, in four years, as the percentage of our gross domestic product, federal spending will be the smallest that it has been in 50 years. One reason is, you know, the third biggest spending item in our budget is interest on the national debt? We get nothing for it. We keep the good faith and credit of the United States. I will pay down the debt every single year until it is eliminated early in the next decade. That gets rid of the third biggest intrusion of the federal government in our economy. Now, because the governor has all this money for a tax cut mostly to the wealthy, there is no money left over, so schools get testing and lawsuit reform and not much else."}

Right now our military is the strongest in the entire history of the world. I will \u2014 I pledge to you I will do whatever is necessary to make sure that it stays that way. Now, what can I bring to that challenge? When I was a young man, my father was a senator opposed to the Vietnam War. When I graduated from college, there were plenty of fancy ways to get out of going and being a part of that. I went and I volunteered, and I went to Vietnam. I didn\u2019t do the most or run the greatest risk by a long shot, but I learned what it was like to be an enlisted man in the United States Army. In the Congress, in the House of Representatives, I served on the House Intelligence Committee and I worked hard to learn the subject of nuclear arms control and how we can diffuse these tensions and deal with non-proliferation and deal with the problems of terrorism and these new weapons of mass destruction. Look, we\u2019re gonna face some serious new challenges in the next four years. I\u2019ve worked on that long and hard. When I went to the United States Senate, I asked for an assignment to the Armed Services Committee. And while I was there I worked on a bipartisan basis, as I did in the House, I worked with former President Reagan on the modernization of our strategic weaponry. In the Senate I was one of only ten Democrats, along with Senator Joe Lieberman, to support Governor Bush\u2019s dad in the Persian Gulf War Resolution. And for the last eight years I\u2019ve served on the National Security Council. Can I say just one other thing here?"}

Just to finish briefly, I started to say that for the last eight years I\u2019ve been on the National Security Council. Last week I broke up \u2014 I suspended campaigning for two days, or parts of two days, to go back and participate in the meetings that charted the President\u2019s summit meeting that he just returned from earlier today. And our team of \u2014 our country\u2019s team over there did a great job. It\u2019s a difficult situation. The United States has to be strong in order to make sure that we can help promote peace and security and stability. And that means keeping our military strong. Now, I said earlier that we are the strongest military, but we need to continue improving readiness and making sure that our military personnel are adequately paid and that the combination of their pay and their benefits and their retirement as veterans is comparable to the stiff competition that\u2019s coming in this strong economy from the private sector. And I have supported the largest pay raise in many a year, and I support another one now. I also support modernization of our strategic and tactical weaponry. The governor has proposed skipping a generation of technology. I think that would be a mistake, because I think one of the ways we\u2019ve been able to be so successful in Kosovo and Bosnia and Haiti and in other places is by having the technological edge. You know, we won that conflict in Kosovo without losing a single human life in combat, a single American life in combat. Now, readiness. The trends before we \u2014 before I got my current job were on the decline, the number of divisions were reduced. I argued that we should reverse that trend and take it back up. And I\u2019m happy to tell you that we have. Now, in my budget for the next ten years I propose $100 billion for this purpose. The governor proposes $45 billion. I propose more than twice as much because I think it\u2019s needed."}

I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be allowed to protect themselves and their families. I believe that we ought to keep guns out of the hands of people that shouldn\u2019t have them. That\u2019s why I\u2019m for instant background checks at gun shows, I\u2019m for trigger locks, I think that makes sense. Matter of fact, we distributed free trigger locks in the State of Texas so that people can get them and put them on their guns to make their guns more safe. I think we ought to raise the age at which juveniles can have a gun. But I also believe strongly that we need to enforce laws on the books that the best way to make sure that we keep our society safe and secure is to hold people accountable for breaking the law. If we catch somebody illegally selling a gun, there needs to be a consequence. If we keep somebody \u2014 you know, illegally using a gun, there needs to be a consequence. Enforcement of law, and the federal government can help. There is a great program called Project Exile in Richmond, Virginia, where we focused federal taxpayers\u2019 money and federal prosecutors and went after people who were illegally using guns. To me that\u2019s how you make society the safest it can be. And so, yeah, sometimes I agree with some of these groups in Washington and sometimes I don\u2019t. I\u2019m a pretty independent thinker. The one thing I\u2019m for is a safe society. And I\u2019m for enforcing laws on the books. And that\u2019s what is going to happen should I earn your confidence."}

But I am familiar with the statement, and it was made by one of the top-ranking officials of that organization. Let me tell you my position. I think that some common sense gun safety measures are certainly needed with the flood of cheap handguns that have sometimes been working their way into the hands of the wrong people. But all of my proposals are focused on that problem, gun safety. None of my proposals would have any effect on hunters, or sportsmen, or people who use rifles. They\u2019re aimed at the real problem. Let\u2019s make our schools safe, let\u2019s make our neighborhoods safe. Let\u2019s have a three-day waiting period, cooling off, so we can have a background check to make sure that criminals and people who really shouldn\u2019t have guns don\u2019t get them. But I would like to use my remaining time on this exchange, Jim, to respond to an exchange that took place just a moment ago. Because a couple of times the governor has said that I am for a bigger government. Governor, I\u2019m not. And let me tell you what the record shows. For the last eight years I have had the challenge of running the streamlining program called Reinventing Government. And if there are any federal employees in this group, you know what that means. The federal government has been reduced in size by more than 300,000 people. And it\u2019s now the smallest number that we have had since the \u2014 the smallest in size since John Kennedy\u2019s administration. During the last five years, Texas\u2019s government has gone up in size. Federal government has gone down, Texas\u2019s government has gone up. Now, my plan for the future, I see a time when we have smaller, smarter government where you don\u2019t have to wait in line because you can get services online cheaper, better, faster. We can do that."}

But that\u2019s the good news. You know what the bad news is that follows on that. The prices are low. In the last several years, the so-called Freedom To Farm Law has, in my view, been mostly a failure. I want to change many of its provisions. Now, many here who are not involved in farming don\u2019t \u2014 won\u2019t follow this, so just forgive me. Because the 2% of the country that is involved in farming is important because the rest of us wouldn\u2019t eat except for them. And you guys have been having a hard time, and I want to fight for you. I want to change those provisions. I want to restore a meaningful safety net. And I think that you pointed the way in your comments, because when you say there are multiple things accomplished by farmers, you\u2019re specifically including conservation and protection of the environment. And yes, farmers are the first environmentalists. And when they decide not to plow a field that is vulnerable to soil erosion, that may cost them a little money, but it helps the environment. I think that we ought to have an expanded conservation reserve program. And I think that the environmental benefits that come from sound management of the land ought to represent a new way for farmers to get some income that will enable them \u2014 enable you to make sensible choices in crop rotation, and when you leave the land fallow and the rest. Now, I\u2019ll go beyond that and say I think we need much more focus on rural economic development programs. I see a time when the Internet-based activities are more available in the rural areas and where the extra source of income that farm families used to have from shoe factories is replaced by an extra source of income from working in the information economy. So we need to do a lot of things, but we ought to start with a better safety net."}

Laura and I are proud parents of teenage girls, twin daughters, and I know what you\u2019re saying. Government ought to stand on the side of parents. Parents are teaching their children right from wrong, and the message oftentimes gets undermined by the popular culture. You bet there\u2019s things that government can do. We can work with the entertainment industry to provide family hour. We can have filters on Internets where public money is spent. There ought to be filters in public libraries and filters in public schools so if kids get on the Internet, there is not going to be pornography or violence coming in. I think we ought to have character education in our schools. I know that doesn\u2019t directly talk about Hollywood, but it does reinforce the values you\u2019re teaching. Greatly expand character education funding so that public schools will teach children values, values which have stood the test of time. There\u2019s afterschool money available. I think that afterschool money ought to be available for faith-based programs and charitable programs that exist because somebody has heard the call to love a neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself. That will help reinforce the values that parents teach at home as well. Ours is a great land, and one of the reasons why is because we\u2019re free. And so I don\u2019t support censorship. But I do believe that we ought to talk plainly to the Hollywood moguls and people who produce this stuff and explain the consequences. I think we need to have rating systems that are clear. I happen to like the idea of having technology for the TV, easy for parents to use so you can tune out these programs you don\u2019t want in your house.

She and her husband made us grandparents almost a year-and-a-half ago, and yet if she\u2019ll forgive me, when she was little, she brought a record home that had some awful lyrics in it and Tipper hit the ceiling. And that launched a campaign to try to get the record companies to put ratings that \u2014 warning labels for parents. And I\u2019m so proud of what she accomplished in getting them on there. I\u2019ve been involved myself in negotiating and helping to move along the negotiations with the Internet service providers to get a parents\u2019 protection page every time 95% of the pages come up. And a feature that allows parents to automatically check with one click what sites your kids have visited lately. You know, some parents are worried about those filters, that you will have to ask your kids how to put them on there. But if you can check up on them, that\u2019s real power. And recently the Federal Trade Commission pointed out that some of these entertainment companies have warned parents that the material is inappropriate for children, and then they\u2019ve turned around behind the backs of the parents and advertised that same adult material directly to children. That is an outrage. Joe Lieberman and I gave them six months to clean up their act. And if they don\u2019t do it, we\u2019re gonna ask for tougher authority in the hands of the FTC on the false and deceptive advertising. I\u2019ll tell you this, I want to do something about this.

I\u2019ve worked hard in the State of Texas to make sure our institutions reflect the state with good, smart policy. Policy that rejects quotas. I don\u2019t like quotas. Quotas tend to pit one group of people against another. Quotas are bad for America. It\u2019s not the way America is all about. But policies that give people a helping hand so they can help themselves. For example, in our State of Texas I worked with the legislature, both Republicans and Democrats, to pass a law that said if you come in the top 10% of your high school class, you\u2019re automatically admitted to one of our higher institutions of learning, college. And as a result, our universities are now more diverse. It was a smart thing to do. What I called it, I labeled it affirmative access. I think the contracting business in government can help. Not with quotas, but help meet a goal of ownership of small businesses, for example. The contracts need to be smaller, the agencies need to be \u2014 need to recruit and to work hard to find people to bid on the state contracts. I think we can do that in a way that represents what America is all about, which is equal opportunity and an opportunity for people to realize their potential.

Appreciate the chance to have a good, honest dialogue about our differences of opinion. I think after three debates the good people of this country understand there is a difference of opinion. There is a difference between big federal government and somebody who is coming from outside of Washington who will trust individuals. I\u2019ve got an agenda that I want to get done for the country. It\u2019s an agenda that says we\u2019re going to reform Medicare to make sure seniors have got prescription drugs and to give seniors different options from which they can choose. It\u2019s an agenda that says we\u2019re listen to the young voices in Social Security and say we\u2019re going to think differently about making sure we have a system, but also fulfill the promise to the seniors in America. A promise made will be a promise kept should I be fortunate enough to become your president. I want to have the military keeping the peace. I want to make sure the public school system in America keeps its promise so not one child is left behind. After setting priorities, I want to give some of your money back. I don\u2019t think the surplus is the government\u2019s money. I think it\u2019s the people\u2019s money. I don\u2019t think the surplus exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the federal government, I think it exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the American people. And you ought to have some of this surplus so you can save and dream and build. I look forward to the final weeks of this campaign. I\u2019m asking for your vote. For those of you for me, thanks for your help. For those of you for my opponent, please only vote once. (LAUGHTER) But for those who have not made up their mind, I would like to conclude by this promise. Should I be fortunate enough to become your president, when I put my hand on the Bible, I will swear to not only uphold the laws of the land, but I will also swear to uphold the honor and the dignity of the office to which I have been elected, so help me God. Thank you very much."}

I want to begin by saying again how much I respect Senator Dole and his record of public service and how hard I will try to make this campaign and this debate one of ideas, not insults. Four years ago I ran for president at a time of high unemployment and rising frustration. I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community where everybody has a role to play. I wanted a government that was smaller and less bureaucratic to help people make the most of their own lives. Four years ago you took me on faith. Now there\u2019s a record: Ten and a half million more jobs, rising incomes, falling crime rates and welfare rolls, a strong America at peace. We are better off than we were four years ago. Let\u2019s keep it going. We cut the deficit by 60 percent. Now, let\u2019s balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans. Now let\u2019s pass the tax cuts for education and child rearing, help with medical emergencies, and buying a home. We passed family and medical leave. Now let\u2019s expand it so more people can succeed as parents and in the work force. We passed 100,000 police, the assault weapons ban, the Brady Bill. Now let\u2019s keep going by finishing the work of putting the police on the street and tackling juvenile gangs. We passed welfare reform. Now let\u2019s move a million people from welfare to work. And most important, let\u2019s make education our highest priority so that every eight-year-old will be able to read, every 12-year-old can log onto the Internet, every 18-year-old can go to college. We can build that bridge to the 21st Century. And I look forward to discussing exactly how we\u2019re going to do it."}

And ever since that time, I\u2019ve tried to give something back to my country, to the people who are watching us tonight. America is the greatest place on the face of the earth. Now, I know millions of you still have anxieties. You work harder and harder to make ends meet and put food on the table. You worry about the quality and the safety of your children, and the quality of education. But even more importantly, you worry about the future and will they have the same opportunities that you and I have had. And Jack Kemp and I want to share with you some ideas tonight. Jack Kemp is my running mate, doing an outstanding job. Now, I\u2019m a plain-speaking man and I learned long ago that your word was your bond. And I promise you tonight that I\u2019ll try to address your concerns and not try to exploit them. It\u2019s a tall order, but I\u2019ve been running against the odds for a long time and, again, I\u2019m honored to be here this evening."}

We reduced more regulations, eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors. But I have worked hard for things like the Family and Medical Leave Law, the Brady Bill, the assault weapons ban, the program to put 100,000 police on the street. All of these are programs that Senator Dole opposed that I supported, because I felt they were a legitimate effort to help people make the most of their own lives. I\u2019ve worked hard to help families impart values to their own children. I supported the V-chip so that parents would be able to control what their kids watch on television when they\u2019re young, along with the ratings systems for television and educational television. I supported strong action against the tobacco companies to stop the marketing, advertising, and sale of tobacco to young people. I supported a big increase in the safe and drug-free schools program. These were areas on which Senator Dole and I differed, but I believed they were the right areas for America to be acting together as one country to help individuals and families make the most of their own lives and raise their kids with good values and a good future."}

We\u2019re going to pass a million bankruptcies this year for the first time in history. We\u2019ve got stagnant wages. In fact, women\u2019s wages have dropped 2.2 percent. Men\u2019s wages haven\u2019t gone up, gone down. So we have stagnation. We have the highest foreign debt in history. And it seems to me that if you take a look, are you better off? Well, I guess some may be better off. Saddam Hussein is probably better off than he was four years ago. Renee Proval (ph) is probably better off than he was four years ago. But are the American people? They\u2019re working harder and higher and harder paying more taxes. For the first time in history, you pay about 40 percent of what you earn. More than you spend for food, clothing and shelter combined for taxes under this administration. So some may be better off. They talk about family income being up. That\u2019s not true in Connecticut, family income is down. And it\u2019s up in some cases because both parents are working. One works for the family, and one works to pay taxes for the government. We\u2019re going to give them tax cuts so they can spend more time with their children, maybe even take a vacation. That\u2019s what America is all about."}

It\u2019s a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans, and small business loans. It\u2019s not good to raise the deficit. We worked too hard to lower it. It will actually raise taxes on nine million people and, in addition to that, it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year. So it sounds great, but our targeted tax cut for education, child rearing, healthcare and home buying, which is paid for in my balanced budget plan, something that he has not done, certified by the Congressional budget office, that\u2019s the right way to go."}

And I told the people exactly what the Congress exactly what kind of bill I would sign. Now, a lot of the trial lawyers didn\u2019t want me to sign any bill at all, but I had thought we ought to do what we could to cut frivolous lawsuits, but they wouldn\u2019t make some of the changes that I thought should be made. Now, let me just give you an example. I had a person in the Oval Office who lost a child in a school bus accident where a drunk driver caused the accident directly, but there were problems with the school bus. The drunk driver had no money. Under the new bill, if I had signed it, a person like that could never have had any recovery. I thought that was wrong. So I gave four or five specific examples to the Congress and said, prove to me that these people could recover but we\u2019re going to eliminate frivolous lawsuits, I\u2019ll sign the bill. But generally I believe that a president has to be willing to do what he thinks is right. I\u2019ve done a lot of things that were controversial. My economic plan, my trade position, Bosnia, Haiti, taking on the NRA for the first time, taking on the tobacco companies for the first time. Sometimes you just have to do that because you know it\u2019s right for the country over the long run.

You\u2019re putting a lot of business people out of business. Small businessmen and businesswomen who paid 70 percent of your ninteen , your$265 billion tax increase, the largest tax increase in the history of America.

We\u2019ve done about all, we are the reform party, the Republican Party. And the Perot voters that are looking for a home ought to take a look at the Republican record. Whatever it is, whatever the checklist was in \u201992, it\u2019s all done with campaign finance reform. I worked with Senator Mitchell, who played me, I guess, in the debate warmup. We tried six or eight years ago. He appointed three people, I appointed three people to get campaign finance reform. We couldn\u2019t get it done, because I wasn\u2019t enforceable. You\u2019ve suggested a commission, Newt Gingrich did, I suggested that at least four or five years ago. We have a commission on campaign finance reform. They send it to Congress, and we have to vote it up or down. That\u2019s how it works. We are never going to fix it by the parties, because Democrats want a better advantage for themselves, we want a better advantage as Republicans, and that\u2019s not how it\u2019s going to work. But I want to touch on this is tobacco thing. I know the President\u2019s been puffing a lot on that. But I want to go back to 1965. That was my first vote against tobacco companies when I said we ought to label cigarettes. And I\u2019ve had a consistent record ever since 1965. We passed a bill in 1992 that encouraged the states to adopt programs to stop kids from smoking. All 50 states did it. It took three and a half years. It wasn\u2019t until election year, Mr. President, that you ever thought about stopping smoking. What about drugs that have increased, doubled in the last 44 months? Cocaine is up 141 percent \u2014 marijuana, cocaine up 166 percent. It seems to me that you have a selective memory. You know, mine doesn\u2019t work that way.

But let me respond to what you said. I agree that too many incumbent politicians in Washington in both parties have consistently opposed campaign finance reform. That was certainly the case from the minute I got there. So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested \u2014 a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission. And I shook hands with him on it and I appointed my members, and the commission never met. And then Senator Dole\u2019s ardent supporters, Senator McCain, who\u2019s out there today, along with Senator Feingold, supported, sponsored a campaign finance reform proposal. I strongly supported it. And members of Senator Dole\u2019s own party in the Senate killed it. And he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill. So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have. And I hope we can finally get it in the next session of Congress, because we need it badly."}

I am. But let\u2019s look at the overall record. Overall in America cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years, casual drug use down 13 percent. The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it. Let me tell you what I tried to do about it. I appointed a four-star general who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country as our nation\u2019s drug czar. The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired. We submitted the biggest drug budget ever. We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border. We supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including, including the death penalty for drug kingpins. And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug-free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all those things were very important. Do I think that I bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still don\u2019t understand drugs are wrong, drugs can kill you. Even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them. I think we all do. And I hope we can do better. I don\u2019t think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I don\u2019t think Senator Dole supports using using drugs. I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn\u2019t dangerous and won\u2019t kill them and won\u2019t destroy their lives, get the message and change."}

I mean, you say we\u2019ve done all these bad things, which isn\u2019t the case. But it seems to me the record is clear. The record is pretty clear in Arkansas, when you were governor. Drug use doubled. You resisted the appointment of a drug czar there because you thought it might interfere with treatment. But here you cut the drug czar\u2019s office 83 percent. You cut interdiction substantially. I mean that\u2019s what, I want to stop it from coming across the border. And in my administration, we\u2019re going to train the National Guard to stop it from coming across the border. This is a invasion of drugs from all over the world. And we have a responsibility. You had a surgeon \u2014 or before General McCaffrey (ph) you had a lady who said we ought to consider legalizing drugs. Is that the kind of leadership we need?

The Brady Bill has kept at least 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers from getting hand guns. Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill. He tried to keep it from coming to my desk. He didn\u2019t succeed and I signed it and I\u2019m glad I did. Then when we had the assault weapons ban in the Senate, Senator Dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the National Rifle Association didn\u2019t want the assault weapons ban, just like they didn\u2019t want the Brady Bill.

Healthcare. Well, we finally passed the Kassebaum bill. The President was opposed to it in 1993. He wanted to give us this big system, that took over about one-seventh of the economy, that put on price controls, created all these state alliances, and would cost $1.5 trillion and force people into managed care, whether they wanted it or not. Most people want to see their own doctor. They\u2019re going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president. We won\u2019t threaten anybody. So we passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy, the Kennedy Kassebaum bill that will cover about 20 to 25 million people. We\u2019ve been for that for four, five, six years. The President held it up. And even when it finally got near passage, Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days, because he wasn\u2019t satisfied with one provision. But it will cover preexisting conditions. If you change your job, you\u2019re going to be covered. So there are a lot of good things in this bill we should have done instead of trying this massive, massive takeover by the Federal government. But then of course we had a Democratic Congress and they didn\u2019t want to do that. Until we got a Republican Congress, we finally got action, I\u2019m proud of my colleagues in the Republican Party for getting that done. It means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight."}

Our schools are getting better, and our schools can be made to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level.

I just don\u2019t believe we ought to be out there running down teachers and attacking them the way you did at the Republican convention.

Their budget cut $270 billion in Medicare and, finally, their budget withdrew the national guarantee of healthcare to poor children, families with children with handicaps, the elderly in nursing homes, poor pregnant women. It was wrong for the country and calling it conservative won\u2019t make it right. It was a bad decision for America and would have been bad for our future if I hadn\u2019t stopped it."}

The auto worker in Toledo who was unemployed when I was elected and now has a great job because we\u2019re number one in auto production again. All the people I\u2019ve met who used to be on welfare who are now working and raising their children. And I think what others could do for our country and themselves if we did the welfare reform thing in the proper way. I think of the man who grabbed me by the shoulder once with tears in his eyes and said his daughter was dying of cancer and he thanked me for giving him a chance to spend some time with her without losing his job because of the Family and Medical Leave Act. I think of all the people I grew up with and went to school with and who I stay in touch with and who nerve let me forget how what we do in Washington affects all of you out there in America.

We\u2019ve already given tax cuts to 15 million of the hardest pressed working families in America. Our plan for the next four years features a $1,500 tax credit, called a Hope Scholarship, for tuition at community college, junior college or college.

It\u2019s too high on the family and it\u2019s particularly too high on working men and women. The average family in America, at median level of income, probably is spending 25 to 26 percent of their income sent to the federal government. That\u2019s more than shelter, food, clothing, and energy. That\u2019s just not right. When I was growing up in Los Angeles, my parents were a one working family, one breadwinner per family was all that was necessary.

The tax code should reflect our values in a Judeo-Christian sense, that work, honesty and integrity and contracts and property and investment and savings should be rewarded, and Bob Dole and Jack Kemp are not only going to cut the tax rates across the board and lower the Capital Gain Tax. I\u2019ll be glad to talk about it a little later, because there\u2019s not enough time, but we are going to repeal the 83-year-old code and replace the seven and a half million words with a flatter, fairer, simpler code that will take this country roaring in the 21st Century."}

We have a specific plan to create 1 million new jobs in the inner cities of America with tax credits for employers who hire people coming off welfare, \u2019cause we\u2019ve passed welfare reform now, we promised to end welfare as we know it. And we are implementing this new legislation. We have moved 1.9 million people off of the welfare rolls and into good jobs in the last four years. Our new plan is to have 1 million more jobs in the inner cities, but that\u2019s not all. We are also implementing the plan to put 100,000 community police officers in our cities. We\u2019ve already got 20,000 out there. We\u2019re ahead of our six-year schedule. As a matter of fact, there\u2019re 8 here in St. Petersburg, already on the beat, you may run into one of them leaving this auditorium tonight. St. Petersburg is safer because of this urban agenda that we\u2019re following. We want the focus to be on millions more jobs, and we\u2019re very optimistic that it\u2019s gonna happen."}

Our empowerment zones and enterprise communities, the tax credits that will encourage the formation of new businesses, the new approach by the small business administration to get more loans out to individuals that have not had equal access to capital in the past. These are parts of the plan. Another part of it is the community development financial institutions. And the \u2014 and the law that says deposits that are made in a community, in the inner cities say, should be kept in the community, not entirely, but some percentage of them should be kept there.

We have defeated in this system of ours fascism, Nazism, communism, socialism is defunct or debunked around the world, the evil of apartheid has ended. There is only one last question remaining for the next century, indeed the next millennium. Can we, in America, make the world\u2019s greatest liberal democracy, this democratic experiment in private property, limited government, the rule of law, respect for families and traditional Judeo-Christian values work, so it can be a blessing to our country and a blessing to the rest of the world? With all due respect to this administration, they\u2019ve got a foreign policy in disarray. They have a lack of credibility around the world. Weakness, I said earlier, is provocative and clearly, this economy is not performing up to the standards that we would expect from this great nation going into the most exciting global economy the world has ever known. There\u2019s something amiss. Our culture seems to be weakening all around us. Families are under tremendous pressure. People do not \u2014 do not feel safe in their homes. A mother doesn\u2019t feel safe sending her child to school. Our schools are not educating. It\u2019s not the problem of the teachers. They are overworked and my daughter will tell you, they are underpaid and we know that, they need to be empowered. We need to reform education. We need to reform welfare. We need to reform litigation and regulation. And we certainly need to reform this tax code that is a product of this terrible century of war and recession and inflations. It can be done. We need somebody who understands the potential of the American people, who are not just doing well for ourselves, we need to do well for the rest of the world, because they\u2019re looking at us. And we need to make it work in every neighborhood and community in America and for every family, so that no one as Bob Dole said in his San Diego acceptance speech is left behind. Bob Dole, as I said earlier, is a man of courage, a man of principles, a man who crawled out of a fox hole on Riva Ridge in 1945 to save a wounded brethren. The bible says no greater love hath a man than he gave his life. Well, Bob Dole did, just about, he\u2019d been through the valley of the shadow and he as Commander-in-Chief can take this country with the courage of Churchill.

I\u2019ve tried to make that clear tonight. And one reason I\u2019ve tried to make it clear is that in just 27 days, the United States of America has an important choice to make. Between two approaches to the future of this country. We have a plan that will create millions more jobs, bring the deficits down further and balance the budget, while protecting Medicare, protecting Medicaid, protecting and preserving the environment, our air, our water, the Everglades, the Tongas, the Mojave Desert in California, the Utah-Red Rocks area, all of which have been protected by President Bill Clinton. We also have a plan to expand access to education. There\u2019s a family in the audience tonight, the McNeil family, who lives right here in St. Petersburg. Both parents are teachers, they\u2019re not rich in money, but they have strong values and they value education. They\u2019re oldest son is a freshman at St. Petersburg Junior High \u2014 Junior College. Their younger son, Roderick, is a sophomore in the same high school that Don McNeil teaches at. Roderick is concerned that he may not be able to get the tuition he needs to go to college when the time comes. Our plan gives a $1500 tax credit to make that junior college essentially free. And a $10,000 tax deduction to make it so that no American family, or almost no family, will have to pay taxes on the money they pay for college tuition. This plan also gives tax breaks on the sale of a home, up to $500,000 in profit tax free. It gives the new break for first-time home buyers, and, again, all in the context of a balanced budget. We have seen progress during the last four years because policies like these have been working. This risky scheme that I\u2019ve described tonight has been said by many objective observers to not add up, it would be a serious risk. Our plan, by contrast, has been working and will work more. We want to build a bridge to the 21st Century and we want it to be strong enough and broad enough for all families to cross and we want it to lead to a brighter future for America, \u2019cause our best days are ahead."}

I want to give a special thanks to my wife Elizabeth, my daughter Robin for their love and support, and thank the people who are listening and watching all over America. In 20 days, you will help decide who will lead this country into the next century. It\u2019s an awesome responsibility. And you must ask yourself, do you know enough about the candidates? You should know as much as possible about each of us. Sometimes the views have been distorted. There\u2019s been millions and millions of dollars of negative advertising spent distorting my views. But I hope tonight you will get a better feel of who Bob Dole is and what he\u2019s all about. And I think first you should \u2014 I should understand that the question on your mind is do I understand your problem. Would I understand it if it occurred to me, and I might just say I\u2019m from a large family. I got lots of relatives and they\u2019re good, average, middle-class, hardworking Americans. They live all across the country. They\u2019re not all Republicans. Maybe all but one. But in any event, I understand the problems. Whether it\u2019s two parents working because one has to pay the taxes and one has to provide for the family, whether it\u2019s a single parent who just barely pays the pressing bills or whether you\u2019re worried about an education for your children going to the best schools, or whether you\u2019re worried about safe playgrounds, drug-free schools, crime-free schools. This is what this election is all about. And hopefully tonight when we conclude this debate you will have a better understanding and the viewing and listening audience will have a better understanding. Thank you."}

Well, thank you, Jim. And thanks to the people of San Diego for giving us this opportunity to have another discussion about the decision we all face in front of people who will make the decision. Again, I will say I will do my best to make this a discussion of ideas and issues, not insults. What really matters is what happens to your future and what happens to our country as we stand on the brink of a new century, a time of extraordinary possibility. I have a simple philosophy that I tried to follow for the last four years: Do what creates opportunity for all, what reinforces responsibility from all of us, and what will help us build a community where everybody\u2019s got a role to play and a place at the table. Compared to four years ago, we\u2019re clearly better off. We\u2019ve got ten and a half million more jobs, the deficit\u2019s been reduced by 60 percent. Incomes are rising for the first time in a decade, the crime rates, the welfare rolls are falling, we\u2019re putting , 100,000 more police on the street. 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers have been denied handguns. But that progress is only the beginning. What we really should focus on tonight is what we still have to do to help the American people make the most of this future that\u2019s out there. I think what really matters is what we can do to build strong families. Strong families need a strong economy. To me that means we have to go on and balance this budget while we protect Medicare and Medicaid and education and the environment. We should give a tax cut, targeted to child rearing and education, to buying a first home and paying for health care. We ought to help protect our kids from drugs and guns and gangs and tobacco. We ought to help move a million people from welfare to work and we ought to create the finest education system in the world where every 18-year-old can go on to college and all of our younger children have great educational opportunities. If we do those things, we can build that bridge to the 21st century. That\u2019s what I hope to get to talk about tonight. Thank you."}

I appreciate the quote from the young man. There\u2019s no doubt about it that many American people have lost their faith in government. They see scandals almost on a daily basis. They see ethical problems in the Whitehouse today. They see 900 FBI files, private person, being gathered up by somebody in the Whitehouse. Nobody knows who hired this man. So there\u2019s a great deal of cynicism out there. But I\u2019ve always tried in whatever I\u2019ve done is to bring people together. I said in my acceptance speech in San Diego about two months ago that the exits are clearly marked. If you think the Republican party is some place for you to come if you\u2019re narrow minded or bigoted or don\u2019t like certain people in America, the exits are clearly marked for you to walk out of as I stand here without compromise, because this is the party of Lincoln. I think we have a real obligation, obviously public officials. I\u2019m no longer a public official. I left public life on June the 11th of this year. But it is very important. Young people are looking to us. They\u2019re looking to us for leadership. They\u2019re watching what we do, what we say, what we promise and what we finally deliver. And I would think, it seems to me that there are opportunities here. When I\u2019m President of the United States, I will keep my word. My word is my bond."}

First of all, let me say what we have done. In the last four years we\u2019ve worked hard to promote more competition to bring down the rate of inflation in health care costs without eroding health care quality. The government pays for Medicare and Medicaid, as you know, and that\u2019s very important. Secondly, we\u2019ve added a million more children to the ranks of the insured through the Medicaid program. We have protected 25 million people through the passage of the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that says you can use your health insurance if you change jobs or someone in your family has been sick. We just recently ended those drive-by deliveries saying people can\u2019t be kicked out of the hospital by insurance companies when they\u2019ve just had babies. So this is, that\u2019s a good start. In the next four years, I want to focus on the following things. Number one, add another million children to the insured ranks through the Medicaid program. Number two, keep working with the states, as we are now, to add 2.2 million more people to the insurance system. Number three, cover people who are between jobs for up to six months. That could protect 3 million families, 700,000 kids. Number four, make sure we protect the integrity with the Medicare program and Medicaid program and not do anything in cutting costs which would cause hundreds of hospitals to close which could have been the case if the 270billion dollar Medicare cut that I vetoed, had been enacted in the law."}

I have heard you say on one TV appearance, \u201cthe media made me do it.\u201d You were trying to defend your cut which was not a cut either, Reduction in the growth of spending. We\u2019ve always had at least 7 percent. You\u2019ve said publicly that it\u2019s now three times the rate of inflation. We ought to cut the growth to twice the rate of inflation. It\u2019s about where we are now. So let\u2019s stop talking about cutting Medicare. In my economic plan we increase it 39percent. Don\u2019t forget what he tried to do with health care. 17 new taxes, spend 1.5 trillion dollars, 50 new bureaucracies. Can you believe that? You couldn\u2019t even have been a cardiologist because he had quotas. You\u2019re a cardiologist, it wouldn\u2019t affect you. But if somebody wanted to be a cardiologist, ten years from now, you\u2019d have to be certain you complied with some of the rules in this extreme medical plan the government was going to take over for all Americans. There are things we can do like the Kassebaum bill. We changed many provisions I authored, cover preexisting conditions, portability, and there are other things we can do. We still need to cover about 20million people and a lot of children."}

I also presented to the Congress and they adopted a large package of quality-of-life improvements, which are very important. I spent a lot of time talking to military families as well as military members all over the world and in bases all across the United States, and I became convinced after talking to the families and the personnel in uniform that we needed to not only have the pay raise but we needed to invest more in child care, housing, and other things to support families, especially when there are longer deployments because of the downsizing of the military. So I, we\u2019re going to do better, and we\u2019ll do better still, but this is a commitment I think that all Americans share without regard to party."}

I propose to spend 1.6 trillion dollars on defense between now and the year 2002 and there\u2019s less than 1 percent difference between my budget and the Republican budget on defense. Now, on the Middle East, as you know, I worked very hard for peace in the Middle East. The agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis was signed at the White House and the agreement \u2014 the peace treaty with Jordan, I was \u2014 I went to Jordan to sign that \u2014 to be there. But \u2014 and I think the United States can do whatever we reasonably can. I can say this: I do not believe Yassir Arafat wants us to send troops to the West Bank. We have never been asked to send troops to the West Bank. I saw the agreement that Prime Minister Rabin and Yassir Arafat signed on the West Bank. It had 26 separate maps they had to sign, literally thousands of delineations of who would do what on the West Bank, and I believe if the parties will get together and in a good-faith manner make that agreement, that they\u2019ll be able to do it if we cannot impose a peace on the Middle East. My position has always been that the job of the United States was to minimize the risks of peace. You know, if they asked me to be part of some monitoring force \u2014 as we are in the Sinai and have been since 1978 \u2014 to monitor the peace between Egypt and Israel, frankly, I would have to think about it. I would have to see what they wanted to do, but I don\u2019t believe that will be the request. I think what Mr. Arafat wants us to do is to make sure that everybody honors the agreements they\u2019ve already made. That\u2019s why I brought the leaders to Washington a few days ago. I think they will, and I think we\u2019ll get there. Don\u2019t be too discouraged."}

If we don\u2019t build more B-2 bombers in California and we lost about 500,000 jobs out in California, because of this devastation, these big, big cuts. We had to make cuts. We didn\u2019t have the cuts the president promised he\u2019d make and then he doubled. I think we need to go back and take a look.

What I want the President to do, and I think he may have done it, his last statement, call for an unconditional end of the violence and have the parties keep on talking as they should talk and have a resolution. The last thing we want to do is commit more forces anywhere. But let\u2019s sort of keep this out of politics because it\u2019s pretty dicey right now."}

My record going back to 1965 in the Congress, the first vote we had was whether or not you should put a little notice on cigarettes. They may be danger \u2014 I voted I for everything since that time. In fact, 1992 we had a bill come before us that all the states had to comply or they\u2019re going to lose certain money. We sent it to the Clinton Administration for implementation, and they waited three and a half years. And during that period about 3,000 young kids every day started smoking. So you add it up. That\u2019s about three million. Not until again in 1996 \u2014 I don\u2019t want anybody to smoke. My brother probably died partly because of cigarettes. I was asked a technical question. Are they addictive? Maybe they \u2014 they probably are addictive. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not a doctor. You shouldn\u2019t smoke. You ought to be glad you quit, Oscar, 30 years. And it seems to me what we need to do is to talk about not only tobacco but drugs, because drug use between 12- and 17-year-olds has doubled in this administration in the last 44 months. Marijuana use is up 141percent. Cocaine use up 160 percent. They\u2019re your kids. It\u2019s all happening in this administration because they cut funding and they cut interdiction. When I\u2019m President of the United States, we\u2019re going to use the National Guard and whatever sources we need to stop some of the drugs coming into America. If you stop the drugs, nobody is going to use the drugs; so don\u2019t smoke, don\u2019t drink, don\u2019t use drugs. Just don\u2019t do it."}

Now they have to try harder if they want to keep getting federal funds. Then we took comments, as we always do, and there were tens of thousands of comments as to how we ought to do it. That\u2019s what drug it out. Meanwhile, we started the \u2014 also in \u201993 to look into whether cigarettes were addictive enough for the Federal Food and Drug Administration to ban the ability of cigarette companies to advertise, market and distribute their products to our kids. No president had ever taken on the tobacco lobby before. I did. Senator Dole opposed me. He went down and made a speech to people who were on his side saying that I did the wrong thing. I think I did the right thing. On drugs, I have repeatedly said drugs are wrong and illegal and can kill you. We have strengthened enforcement, and everybody in San Diego knows we strengthened control of the border. We have done a lot more, and I hope we get a chance to talk about it."}

When I became president I used the authority I had in this law to get out from certain federal rules to help states move people to work. We reduced the welfare rolls by 2 million already. Now, I\u2019ve got a plan with this new welfare reform law to work with the private sector, to give employees specific tax incentives to hire people off welfare, and to do some other things which will create more jobs in the private sector, at least a million, and move more people from welfare to work. It\u2019s very important. And I hope we get a chance to talk about this more. There\u2019s not a more important issue. I, I still remember a woman that I met ten years ago who said she wanted to get off welfare so her kids could tell, give an answer when they say, \u201cWhat does your mother do for a job?\u201d I met that woman again.

My view is we want to find jobs and opportunities and education. This year the Republican Congress, as far as student loans went from 24 billion to 36 billion over the next six years. A 50 percent increase. The highest appropriation. 6 billion dollars for Pell Grants, very, very important. We also raised the amount of each Pell Grant. In our economic plan, the $500 child credit can be used for young people, rolled over and over and over, you, of course not this age, but if you have a child two years old, 7 percent interest would be worth about $18,000 by the time that child was ready for college."}

But because I still believe that there is some discrimination and that not everybody has an opportunity to prove they\u2019re qualified, I favor the right kind of Affirmative Action. I\u2019ve done more to eliminate Affirmative Action programs I didn\u2019t think were fair and tighten others up than my predecessors have, since affirmative action\u2019s been around. But I have also worked hard to give people a chance to prove that they are qualified. Let me just give you some examples. We\u2019ve doubled the number of loans from the small business administration, tripled the number of loans to women business people, no one unqualified, everybody had to meet the standards. We\u2019ve opened 260,000 new jobs in the military to women since I\u2019ve been president. But the joint chiefs say we\u2019re stronger and more confident and solid than ever. Let me give you another example of what I mean. To me, Affirmative Action is making that extra effort. It\u2019s sort of like what Senator Dole did when he sponsored the Americans with Disabilities Act and said to certain stores, okay, you have to make it accessible to people in wheelchairs. We weren\u2019t guaranteeing anything, anybody anything except the chance to prove they were qualified, the chance to prove that they could do it. And that\u2019s why I must say I agree with General Colin Powell that we\u2019re not there yet. We ought to keep making those extra effort Affirmative Action programs, the law and the policy of the land."}

It shouldn\u2019t be that way. Now, the President can say well he wants to mend it, not end it. There are 168 federal programs that allow quotas. He ended one. Now, this economic package, Tim, I\u2019m glad you asked, because you look like the type that might be able to benefit from a 15 percent across- the-board tax cut and $500-per-child tax credit, or \u2014 you know, estate tax relief which you\u2019re not interested in right now, but capital gains rate reduction. If you\u2019re taking care of an elderly parent, you get a $1,000 deduction. We think that\u2019s very important because a lot of people take care of their parents. How do we pay for it? You can have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, which the President opposed and defeated. He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote with him and lost by one vote. We\u2019re going to balance the budget, by the year 2002. The President wants to spend 20 percent more in the next six years, and I want to spend 14 percent more and give that 6 percent back to the people.

Don\u2019t take my word for this. The Economist magazine polled lots of economists, seven Nobel prize winners who said if this tax scheme passes, it will require huge cuts, 40 percent, in the environment and law enforcement and education. It will require bigger cuts in Medicare than I vetoed last time. My targeted tax cut is for child-rearing, buying a first-time home, paying for health care costs.

I don\u2019t take credit for all the good things that have happened in America, but I take credit for what I\u2019ve tried to do to work with others to make good things happen. Most important good things that happen in America happen in families. Just about every family I know, the main concern is how am I going to succeed at work and still do right by my children. Family medical leave has let 12 million families take a little time off for the birth of a child or a family illness without losing their job. I\u2019d like to see it expanded in two ways. I\u2019d like to say you can also take a little time off without losing your job to go to a regular parent-teacher conference or to go to a regular doctor\u2019s appointment with a family member. I\u2019d also like to see the overtime laws change so that we could have some more flex time so that at the discretion of the worker, the worker, if you earn overtime, you could decide when you want that time to be taken, in cash or in time with your family if you\u2019ve got a family problem. I never go anywhere, it seems like, where I don\u2019t meet somebody who has benefited from a Family Leave Law. In Longview, Texas the other day, I met a woman who was almost in tears because she had been able to keep her job while spending time with her husband who had cancer. One of the people who\u2019s here with me today met a woman in the airport saying her son, Jess was able to be present at the birth of her child because of the Family Leave Law. So yes, I think it should be expanded. We have to help people succeed at home and at work."}

And I think what we have to do is convince people there is a big difference, if you vote one way you will have a Department of Education in the 21st century, if you vote the other way, you won\u2019t. If you vote one way you will have an expansion of family leave. If you vote the other way, you will be lucky to save it. But these are important questions. And people have to decide.

So we\u2019ve got to figure out how are we going to have more people with pension plans, and pension coverage has been declining as more and more people work for small businesses and fewer people work for big businesses. So what, what is in my plan and I think it\u2019s almost identical in Senator Dole\u2019s plans is we make more people eligible to save in an IRA and let couples, married couples save more and then they could withdraw from it tax-free if they needed to, for medical emergencies or buy a home or education, but they could also save to supplement retirement. In addition to that, we just passed a sweeping small business reform that makes it easier for small business people to take out 401 K plans for themselves and employees and much easier for employees to carry it from job to job. My best friend from grade school is a computer software salesman and he told me last time he changed employers it took him nine months to figure out how to transfer his 401K plan. Now none of that will happen anymore. I hope over the next ten years you will see a big increase over the percentage of people that have pension plans, plus a secure Social Security system."}

We saw that message in the late 70s when heard a lot about change, and what happened, that misery index went right through the roof. But my economic program is the kind of change we want. And the way we\u2019re going to get it done is we\u2019re going to have a brand new Congress. A lot of them are thrown out because of all the scandals. I\u2019ll sit down with them, Democrats and Republicans alike, and work for my agenda for American renewal, which represents real change. But I\u2019d say, if you had to separate out, I think it\u2019s experience at this level."}

That\u2019s because we believe in investing in education and in jobs. And we have to change in this country. You know, my wife, Hillary, gave me a book about a year ago in which the author defined insanity as just doing the same old thing over and over again and expecting a different result. We have got to have the courage to change. Experience is important, yes. I\u2019ve gotten a lot of good experience in dealing with ordinary people over the last year and month. I\u2019ve touched more people\u2019s lives and seen more heartbreak and hope, more pain and more promise, than anybody else who\u2019s run for president this year. I think the American people deserve better than they\u2019re getting. We have gone from first to thirteenth in wages in the world in the last twelve years, since Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan have been in. Personal income has dropped while people have worked harder. In the last four years, there have been twice as many bankruptcies as new jobs created. We need a new approach. The same old experience is not relevant. We\u2019re living in a new world after the Cold War, and what works in this new world is not trickle down, not government for the benefit of the privileged few, not tax and spend, but a commitment to invest in American jobs and American education, controlling American health care costs, and bringing the American people together. That is what works. And you can have the right kind of experience and the wrong kind of experience. Mine is rooted in the real lives of real people, and it will bring real results if we have the courage to change."}

And we worked it out, and indeed we\u2019re moving forward all around the world in a much more peaceful way. So that one we came away with in creating jobs for the American people. I would simply say to her, look, take a look at what the president has proposed on job retraining. When you cut back on defense spending, some people are going to be thrown out of work. If you throw another 50,000 kids on the street because of cutting recklessly in troop levels, you\u2019re going to put a lot more out of work. I would say to them, look at the job retraining programs that we\u2019re proposing. Therein is the best answer to her. And another one is: stimulate investment and savings. I mean, we\u2019ve got big economic problems, but we are not coming apart at the seams; we\u2019re ready for a recovery. With interest rates down and inflation down, the cruelest tax of all, caught up in a global slowdown right now, that that will change if you go with the programs I\u2019ve talked about and if you help with job retraining and education. I am a firm believer that our America 2000 education problem is the answer\u2013a little longer run; it\u2019s going to take awhile to educate. But it is a good program. So her best help for short term is job retraining, if she was thrown out of work at a defense plant. But tell her it\u2019s not all that gloomy; we\u2019re the US, we faced tough problems before. Look at the misery index when the Democrats had both the White House and the Congress. It was just right through the roof. Now, we can do better. And the way to do better is not to tax and spend but to retrain, get that control of the mandatory spending programs. I\u2019m much more optimistic about this country than some."}

That was their response to that sort of action. Now that the voices in the Congress and throughout the country have insisted that we do something about China, look at what has happened. China has finally agreed to stop sending us products made with prison labor. Not because we coddled them, but because the Administration was pushed into doing something about it. And recently the Chinese have announced they are going to lower some barriers to our products, which they ought to do since they have a 15 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States under Mr. Bush. The second biggest surplus next to Japan. So I would be firm. I would say if you want to continue as Most Favored Nation status for your government owned industries as well as your private ones, observe human rights in the future. Open your society. Recognize the legitimacy of those kids that were carrying the Statue of Liberty. If we can stand up for our economics, we ought to be able to preserve the democratic interests of the people of China.

I\u2019ve seen the family values of all these people in America who are out there killing themselves working harder for less in a country that\u2019s had the worst economic years in 50 years and the first decline in industrial production ever. I think the president owes it to family values to show that he values America\u2019s families, whether they\u2019re people on welfare you\u2019re trying to move from welfare to work, the working poor whom I think deserve a tax break to lift them above poverty if they\u2019ve got a child in the house and working 40 hours a week, working families who deserve a fair tax system and the opportunity for constant retraining; they deserve a strong economy.

We need a hundred thousand more police on the street. I have a plan for that. Secondly, we ought to have treatment on demand. Thirdly, we ought to have boot camps for first-time nonviolent offenders so they can get discipline and treatment and education and get reconnected to the community before they\u2019re severed and sent to prison, where they can learn how to be first class criminals. There is a crime bill that, lamentably, was blocked from passage once again, mostly by Republicans in the US Senate, which would have addressed some of these problems.

So I can\u2019t tell you where it\u2019s coming from, but I am very much concerned about AIDS and I believe that we\u2019ve got the best researchers in the world out there at NIH working the problem.

It was a beautiful moment and I think she\u2019ll do a first-class job on that commission. So I think the appeal is yes, we care. And the other thing is part of AIDS \u2014 it\u2019s one of the few diseases where behavior matters. And I once called on somebody, \u201cWell, change your behavior. Is the behavior you\u2019re using prone to cause AIDS? Change the behavior.\u201d Next thing I know, one of these ACT UP groups is out saying, \u201cBush ought to change his behavior.\u201d You can\u2019t talk about it rationally. The extremes are hurting the AIDS cause. To go into a Catholic mass in a beautiful cathedral in New York under the cause of helping in AIDS and start throwing condoms around in the mass, I\u2019m sorry, I think it sets back the cause. We cannot move to the extreme. We\u2019ve got to care. We\u2019ve got to continue everything we can at the federal and the local level.

You can\u2019t take different positions on these difficult issues. And then you need a philosophical \u2014 I\u2019d call it a philosophical underpinning. Mine for foreign affairs is democracy and freedom, and look at the dramatic changes around the world. The Cold War is over. The Soviet Union is no more and we\u2019re working with a democratic country. Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the Baltics are free. Take a look at the Middle East. We had to stand up against a tyrant. The US came together as we haven\u2019t in many, many years. And we kicked this man out of Kuwait. And in the process, as a result of that will and that decision and that toughness, we now have ancient enemies talking peace in the Middle East. Nobody would have dreamed it possible. And I think the biggest dividend of making these tough calls is the fact that we are less afraid of nuclear war. Every parent out there has much less worry that their kids are going to be faced with nuclear holocaust. All this is good. On the domestic side, what we must do is have change that empowers people \u2014 not change for the sake of change, tax and spend. We don\u2019t need to do that any more. What we need to do is empower people. We need to invest and save. We need to do better in education. We need to do better in job retraining. We need to expand our exports, and they\u2019re going very, very well, indeed. And we need to strengthen the American family. I hope as president that I\u2019ve earned your trust. I\u2019ve admitted it when I make a mistake, but then I go on and help, try to solve the problems. I hope I\u2019ve earned your trust because a lot of being president is about trust and character.

Bill Clinton and I have a detailed 5-year budget plan to create good jobs, cut the budget deficit in half, and eliminate the investment deficit in order to get our economy moving forward again. We have a $20-billion infrastructure fund to create a nationwide network of high-speed rail, for example, and what are called information superhighways to open up a whole universe of knowledge for our young people and to help our universities and companies that rely on new advances in the information revolution. We also have tax incentives for investment in job-creating activities, not the kind of encouragement for short-term rip-offs like the proposal that we have had from George Bush. But I want to return and say one more time - you have used our tax dollars to subsidize the recruitment of US companies to move overseas and throw Americans out of work. In Decaturville, Tennessee, not very far from my home, a factory was shut down right there when they were solicited by officials paid with US taxpayers\u2019 money, and then the replacement workers in a foreign country were trained with our tax dollars and then their imports were subsidized coming back into the US.

Bill Clinton and I agree with so many military experts who believe that it is time for the Europeans, who are so much wealthier now and more powerful than they were at the end of World War II to start picking up a little more of that tab themselves and not rely so exclusively on the US taxpayers for the defense of Europe.

And that\u2019s why we support choice in education. I was in Beaumont, Texas, and met with small business people, and they wanted to reform the civil justice system because they think our legal system costs too much and there\u2019s too much of a delay in getting an answer.

I was in Vilnius, Lithuania, Independence Square, speaking to 10,000 people in the middle of winter. Hundreds of people came up to me and said - God bless America. Yes, in the next 4 years, as I said, somewhere, some time, there\u2019s going to be a crisis, and you need to have a president that is qualified, has the experience, and has been tested. Not one time during this evening, during 90 minutes, did Al Gore tell us why Bill Clinton is qualified to be president. He never answered my charges that Bill Clinton has trouble telling the truth.

You see, I don\u2019t think the American people are taxed too little. I think they\u2019re taxed too much. I went for one tax increase and when I make a mistake I admit it. I said that wasn\u2019t the right thing to do. Governor Clinton\u2019s program wants to tax more and spend more \u2014 $150 billion in new taxes, spend another $220. I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the way to do it. Here\u2019s some thing that\u2019ll help. Give us a balanced budget amendment. He always talks about Arkansas having a balanced budget and they do, but he has a balanced budget amendment. Have to do it. I\u2019d like the government to have that. And I think it would discipline not only the Congress, which needs it, but also the executive branch. I\u2019d like to have what 43 governors have \u2014 the line item veto, so if the Congress can\u2019t cut, and we\u2019ve got a reckless spending Congress, let the president have a shot at it by wiping out things that are pork barrel or something of that nature. I\u2019ve proposed another one. Some sophisticates think it may be a little gimmicky. I think it\u2019s good. It\u2019s a check- off. It says to you as a taxpayer \u2014 say you\u2019re going to pay a tax of 1000 bucks or something. You can check 10% of that if you want to, in the 1 box, and that 10%, $100, or if you\u2019re paying $10,000, whatever it is, $1000, check it off and make the government, make it lower the deficit by that amount. And if the Congress won\u2019t do it, if they can\u2019t get together and negotiate how to do that, then you\u2019d have a sequester across the board. You\u2019d exempt Social Security \u2014 I don\u2019t want to tax or touch Social Security. I\u2019m the president that said hey, don\u2019t mess with Social Security, and we haven\u2019t. So I believe that we need to control the growth of mandatory spending, back to this gentleman\u2019s question. That\u2019s the main growing thing in the budget. The program that the president \u2014 two-thirds of the budget, I as president never get to look at, never get to touch. We\u2019ve got to control that growth to inflation and population increase, but not raise taxes on the American people now. I just don\u2019t believe that would stimulate any kind of growth at all."}

I was down in Texas taking care of business, tending to my family. This situation got so bad that I decided I\u2019d better get into it. The American people asked me to get into it.

Now, they\u2019re the 2 folks involved so maybe if you put them together, they did it. Now, the facts are we have to fix it. I\u2019m here tonight for these young people up here in the balcony from this college. When I was a young man, when I got out of the Navy I had multiple job offers. Young people with high grades can\u2019t get a job. People \u2014 the 18- to 24-year-old high school graduates 10 years ago were making more than they are now. In other words, we were down to 18% of them were making \u2014 18- to 24-year- olds were making less than $12,000. Now that\u2019s up to 40%. And what\u2019s happened in the meantime? The dollar\u2019s gone through the floor. Now, whose fault is that? Not the Democrats. Not the Republicans. Somewhere out there there\u2019s an extraterrestrial that\u2019s doing this to us, I guess. And everybody says they take responsibility. Somebody somewhere has to take responsibility for this. Put it to you bluntly, American people. If you want me to be your president, we\u2019re going to face our problems. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll deal with our problems, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll solve our problems. We\u2019ll down our debt. We\u2019ll pass on the American dream to our children, and I will not leave our children a situation that they have today. When I was a boy it took 2 generations to double the standard of living.

I think you have to look at it. I think that has to be a part of a candidate for president or being president. In terms of programs, I\u2019ve submitted, what, 4 different budgets to the US Congress in great detail. It\u2019s so heavy they\u2019d give you a broken back. And everything in there says what I am for. Now I\u2019ve come out with a new agenda for America\u2019s renewal, a plan that I believe really will help stimulate the growth of this economy. My record on world affairs is pretty well known because I\u2019ve been president for 4 years, so I feel I\u2019ve been talking issues. You know, nobody likes who shot John, but I think the first negative campaign run in this election was by Governor Clinton, and I\u2019m not going to sit there and be a punching bag; I\u2019m going to stand up and say, hey, listen, here\u2019s my side of it. But character is an important part of the equation. The other night Governor Clinton raised my \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you saw the debate the other night. You did \u2014 suffered through that? Well, he raised the question of my father \u2014 it was a good line, well rehearsed and well delivered. But he raised the question of my father and said, well, your father, Prescott Bush, was against McCarthy, you should be ashamed of yourself, McCarthyism. I remember something my dad told me \u2014 I was 18 years old going to Penn Station to go on into the Navy, and he said write your mother \u2014 which I faithfully did; he said serve your country \u2014 my father was an honor, duty and country man; and he said tell the truth. And I\u2019ve tried to do that in public life, all through it. That says something about character. My argument with Governor Clinton \u2014 you can call it mud wrestling, but I think it\u2019s fair to put it in focus is \u2014 I am deeply troubled by someone who demonstrates and organizes demonstration in a foreign land when his country\u2019s at war. Probably a lot of kids here disagree with me. But that\u2019s what I feel. That\u2019s what I feel passionately about. I\u2019m thinking of Ross Perot\u2019s running mate sitting in the jail. How would he feel about it? But maybe that\u2019s generational. I don\u2019t know. But the big argument I have with the governor on this is this taking different positions on different issues \u2014 trying to be one thing to one person here that\u2019s opposing the NAFTA agreement and then for it \u2014 what we call waffling. And I do think that you can\u2019t turn the White House into the Waffle House. You\u2019ve got to say what you\u2019re for and you\u2019ve got to \u2014"}

We passed this year the most furthest looking transportation bill in the history of this country since Eisenhower started the interstate highways \u2014 $150 billion for improving the infrastructure. That happened when I was president. And so I\u2019m very proud of the way that came about and I think it\u2019s a very, very good beginning. Like Mr. Perot, I am concerned about the deficits and $150 billion is a lot of money, but it\u2019s awful hard to say we\u2019re going to go out and spend more money when we\u2019re trying to get the deficit down. But I would cite that as a major accomplishment. We hear all the negatives. When you\u2019re president you expect this. Everybody\u2019s running against the incumbent. They can do better. Everyone knows that. But here\u2019s something that we can take great pride in because it really does get to what you\u2019re talking about. Our home initiative \u2014 our home ownership initiative \u2014 HOPE \u2014 that passed the Congress is a good start for having people own their own homes instead of living in these deadly tenements. Our enterprise zones, that we hear a lot of lip service about in Congress, would bring jobs into the inner city. There\u2019s a good program. And I need the help of everybody across this country to get it passed in a substantial way by the Congress. When we went out to south central in Los Angeles \u2014 some of you may remember the riots there. I went out there. I went to a boys\u2019 club. And everyone of them \u2014 the boys\u2019 club leaders, the ministers \u2014 all of them were saying pass enterprise zones. We go back to Washington and very difficult to get it through the Congress. But there\u2019s going to be a new Congress. No one likes gridlock. There\u2019s going to be a new Congress because the old one \u2014 I don\u2019t want to get this man made at me \u2014 but there was a post office scandal and a bank scandal. You\u2019re going to have a lot of new members of Congress. And then you can sit down and say, help me do what we should for the cities. Help me pass these programs."}

This is facts \u2014 that would have given investment tax credits and other incentives to reinvest in our cities, in our country. But it asked the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more. Mr. Perot wants to do the same thing. I agree with him. I mean, we agree with that. But let me tell you specifically what my plan does. My plan would dedicate $20 billion a year in each of the next 4 years for investments in new transportation, communications, environmental clean-ups and new technologies for the 21st century. And we would target it especially in areas that have been either depressed or which have lost a lot of defense related jobs. There are 200,000 people in California, for example, who have lost their defense related jobs. They ought to be engaged in making high speed rail. They ought to be engaged in breaking ground in other technologies, doing waste recycling, clean water technology and things of that kind. We can create millions of jobs in these new technologies- -more than we\u2019re going to lose in defense \u2014 if we target it. But we\u2019re investing a much smaller percentage of our income in the things you just asked about than all of our major competitors, and our wealth growth is going down as a result of it. It\u2019s making the country poorer, which is why I answered the gentleman the way I did before. We have to both bring down the deficit and get our economy going through these kinds of investments in order to get the kind of wealth and jobs and incomes we need in America."}

I talk to the Republican leaders and they want it. But since they\u2019re bred from childhood to fight with one another rather than get results, you know, I would be glad to drop out and spend a little time and see if we couldn\u2019t build some bridges. Now, results is what counts. The president can\u2019t order Congress around. Congress can\u2019t order the president around. That\u2019s not bad for a guy that\u2019s never been there, right? But you have to work together. Now, I have talked to the chairmen of the committees that want this. They\u2019re Democrats. The president wants it, but we can\u2019t get it because we sit here in gridlock because it\u2019s a campaign year. We didn\u2019t fund a lot of other things this year, like the savings and loan mess. That\u2019s another story that we\u2019re going to pay a big price for right after the election. The facts are though \u2014 the facts are \u2014 the American people are hurting. These people are hurting in the inner cities. We\u2019re shipping the quote, \u201clow paying jobs\u201d overseas. What are low paying jobs? Textiles, shoes, things like that that we say are yesterday\u2019s industries. They\u2019re tomorrow\u2019s industries in the inner cities.

I live in a state where over half the adults have hunting or fishing licenses, or both. But I believe we have to have some way of checking hand guns before they\u2019re sold, to check the criminal history, the mental health history, and the age of people who are buying them. Therefore I support the Brady bill which would impose a national waiting period unless and until a state did what only Virginia has done now, which is to automate its records. Once you automate your records, then you don\u2019t have to have a waiting period, but at least you can check. I also think we should have frankly restrictions on assault weapons whose only purpose is to kill. We need to give the police a fighting chance in our urban areas where the gangs are building up. The third thing I would say \u2014 it doesn\u2019t bear directly on gun control, but it\u2019s very important \u2014 we need more police on the street. There is a crime bill which would put more police on the street, which was killed for this session by a filibuster in the Senate, mostly be Republican senators, and I think it\u2019s a shame it didn\u2019t pass, I think it should be made the law \u2014 but it had the Brady bill in it, the waiting period. I also believe that we should offer college scholarships to people who will agree to work them off as police officers, and I think, as we reduce our military forces, we should let people earn military retirement by coming out and working as police officers. Thirty years ago there were three police officers on the street for every crime; today there are three crimes for every police officer. In the communities which have had real success putting police officers near schools where kids carry weapons, to get the weapons out of the schools, are on the same blocks, you\u2019ve seen crime go down. In Houston there\u2019s been a 15- percent drop in the crime rate in the last year because of the work the mayor did there in increasing the police force. So I know it can work; I\u2019ve seen it happen."}

It\u2019s very hard. I have been fighting for very strong anti-crime legislation \u2014 habeas corpus reform, so you don\u2019t have these endless appeals, so when somebody gets sentenced, hey, this is for real. I\u2019ve been fighting for changes in the exclusionary rule so if an honest cop stops somebody and makes a technical mistake, the criminal doesn\u2019t go away. I\u2019ll probably get into a fight in this room with some but I happen to think that we need stronger death penalties for those that kill police officers. Virginia\u2019s in the lead in this, as Governor Clinton properly said, on this identification system for firearms. I am not for national registration of firearms. Some of the states that have the toughest anti-gun laws have the highest levels of crime. I am for the right, as the governor says- -I\u2019m a sportsman and I don\u2019t think you ought to eliminate all kinds of weapons. But I was not for the bill that he was talking about because it was not tough enough on the criminal. I\u2019m very pleased that the Fraternal Order of Police in Little Rock, Arkansas endorsed me because I think they see I\u2019m trying to strengthen the anti-crime legislation. We\u2019ve got more money going out for local police than any previous administration. So we\u2019ve got to get it under control and there\u2019s one last point I\u2019d make. Drugs. We have got to win our national strategy against drugs, the fight against drugs. And we\u2019re making some progress, doing a little better on interdiction. We\u2019re not doing as well amongst the people that get to be habitual drug-users. The good news is, and I think it\u2019s true in Richmond, teenage use is down of cocaine, substantially, 60% in the last couple of years.

I want to cut the size of the congressional staffs, but I think you\u2019re going to have too much influence there with people who were never elected, who have lots of expertise.

I favor strict controls on how much you can spend running for Congress, strict limits on political action committees, requirements that people running for Congress appear in open public debates like we\u2019re doing now. If you did that you could take away the incumbents\u2019 advantage because challengers like me would have a chance to run against incumbents like him for House races and Senate races, and then the voters could make up their own mind without being subject to an unfair fight.

So let me try to answer you in this way. Let\u2019s start with a premise. We spend 30% more of our income than any nation on earth on health care, and yet we insure fewer people. We have 35 million people without any insurance at all \u2014 and I see them all the time. A hundred thousand Americans a month have lost their health insurance just in the last 4 years. So if you analyze where we\u2019re out of line with other countries, you come up with the following conclusions. Number one, we spend at least $60 billion a year on insurance, administrative cost, bureaucracy, and government regulation that wouldn\u2019t be spent in any other nation. So we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everybody. Employers would cover their employees, government would cover the unemployed. Number 2, I think you have to take on specifically the insurance companies and require them to make some significant change in the way they rate people in the big community pools. I think you have to tell the pharmaceutical companies they can\u2019t keep raising drug prices at three times the rate of inflation. I think you have to take on medical fraud. I think you have to help doctors stop practicing defensive medicine. I\u2019ve recommended that our doctors be given a set of national practice guidelines and that if they follow those guidelines that raises the presumption that they didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I think you have to have a system of primary and preventive clinics in our inner cities and our rural areas so people can have access to health care. The key is to control the cost and maintain the quality. To do that you need a system of managed competition where all of us are covered in big groups and we can choose our doctors and our hospitals, a wide range, but there is an incentive to control costs. And I think there has to be \u2014 I think Mr. Perot and I agree on this, there has to be a national commission of health care providers and health care consumers that set ceilings to keep health costs in line with inflation, plus population growth. Now, let me say, some people say we can\u2019t do this but Hawaii does it. They cover 98% of their people and their insurance premiums are much cheaper than the rest of America, and so does Rochester, New York. They now have a plan to cover everybody and their premiums are two-thirds of the rest of the country. This is very important. It\u2019s a big human problem and a devastating economic problem for America, and I\u2019m going to send a plan to do this within the first 100 days of my presidency. It\u2019s terribly important."}

I see people in my state, middle class people \u2014 their taxes have gone up in Washington and their services have gone down while the wealthy have gotten tax cuts. I have seen what\u2019s happened in this last 4 years when \u2014 in my state, when people lose their jobs there\u2019s a good chance I\u2019ll know them by their names. When a factory closes, I know the people who ran it. When the businesses go bankrupt, I know them. And I\u2019ve been out here for 13 months meeting in meetings just like this ever since October, with people like you all over America, people that have lost their jobs, lost their livelihood, lost their health insurance. What I want you to understand is the national debt is not the only cause of that. It is because America has not invested in its people. It is because we have not grown. It is because we\u2019ve had 12 years of trickle down economics. We\u2019ve gone from first to twelfth in the world in wages. We\u2019ve had 4 years where we\u2019ve produced no private sector jobs. Most people are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago. It is because we are in the grip of a failed economic theory. And this decision you\u2019re about to make better be about what kind of economic theory you want, not just people saying I\u2019m going to go fix it but what are we going to do? I think we have to do is invest in American jobs, American education, control American health care costs and bring the American people together again."}

The Social Security system was fixed about 5 years, and I think it\u2019s projected out to be sound beyond that. So at least we have time to work with it. But on all of these things, a sound economy is the only way to get it going. Growth in the economy is gonna add to the overall prosperity and wealth. I can\u2019t give you a specific answer on Pension Guarantee Fund. All I know is that we have firm government credit to guarantee the pensions. And that is very important. But it\u2019s \u2014 the full faith and credit of the US, in spite of our difficulties, is still pretty good. It\u2019s still the most respected credit. So I would simply say, as these dates get close, you\u2019re going to have to reorganize and refix as we did with the Social Security Fund. And I think that\u2019s the only answer. But the more immediate answer is to do what this lady was suggesting we do, and that is to get this deficit down and get on without adding to the woes, and then restructure. One thing I\u2019ve called for that has been stymied, and I\u2019ll keep on working for it, is a whole financial reform legislation. It is absolutely essential in terms of bringing our banking system and credit system into the new age instead of having it living back in the dark ages. And it\u2019s a big fight. And I don\u2019t want to give my friend Ross another shot at me here but I am fighting with the Congress to get this through. And you can\u2019t just go up and say I\u2019m going to fix it. You\u2019ve got some pretty strong-willed guys up there that argue with you. But that\u2019s what the election\u2019s about. I agree with the governor. That\u2019s what the election\u2019s about.

You have a raging debate about those plans. Then out of that debate, with leadership, comes consensus. Then, if the plans are huge and complex like health care, I would urge you to implement pilot programs. Like the old carpenter says measure twice, cut once. Let\u2019s make sure this thing\u2019s as good as we all think it is at the end of the meeting. Then finally, our government passes laws and freezes the plan in concrete. Anybody that\u2019s ever built a successful business will tell you you optimize, optimize, optimize after you\u2019ve put something into effect. The reason Medicare and Medicaid are a mess is we froze them. Everybody knows how to fix them. There are people all over the federal government, if they could just touch it with a screwdriver, could fix it. Now, back over here. See, we\u2019ve got a $4 trillion debt and only in America would you have $2.8 trillion of it or 70% of it financed 5 years or less. Now, that\u2019s another thing for you to think about when you go home tonight. You don\u2019t finance long-term debt with short-term money. Why did our government do it? To get the interest rates down. A 1% increase in interest rates in that $2.8 trillion is $28 billion a year. Now, when you look at what Germany pays for money and what we don\u2019t pay for money, you realize there\u2019s quite a spread, right, and you realize this is a temporary thing and there\u2019s going to be another sucking sound that runs our deficit through the roof. You know, and everybody\u2019s ducking it so I\u2019m gonna say it, that we are not letting that surplus stay in the bank. We are not investing that surplus like a pension fund. We are spending that surplus to make the deficit look smaller to you than it really is. Now, that \u2014 put you in jail in corporate America if you kept books that way but in government it\u2019s just kind of the way things are. That\u2019s because it comes at you, not from you.

Since I became president, 43, 44 countries have gone democratic, no longer totalitarian, no longer living under dictatorship or communist rule. This is exciting. New world order to me means freedom and democracy. I think we will have a continuing responsibility, as the only remaining superpower, to stay involved. If we pull back in some isolation and say we don\u2019t have to do our share, or more than our share, anymore, I believe you are going to just ask for conflagration that we\u2019ll get involved in the future. NATO, for example, has kept the peace for many, many years, and I want to see us keep fully staffed in NATO so we\u2019ll continue to guarantee the peace in Europe. But the exciting thing is, the fear of nuclear war is down. And you hear all the bad stuff that\u2019s happened on my watch; I hope people will recognize that this is something pretty good for mankind. I hope they\u2019ll think it\u2019s good that democracy and freedom is on the move. And we\u2019re going to stay engaged, as long as I\u2019m president, working to improve things. You know, it\u2019s so easy now to say, hey, cut out foreign aid, we got a problem at home. I think the US has to still have the Statue of Liberty as a symbol, caring for others. Right this very minute we\u2019re sending supplies in to help these little starving kids in Somalia. It\u2019s the US that\u2019s taken the lead in humanitarian aid into Bosnia. We\u2019re doing this all around the world. Yes, we got problems at home. And I think I got a good plan to help fix those problems at home. But because of our leadership, because we didn\u2019t listen to the freeze \u2014 the nuclear-freeze group, do you remember \u2014 freeze it, back in the late 70s \u2014 freeze, don\u2019t touch it; we\u2019re going to lock it in now or else we\u2019ll have war. President Reagan said no, peace through strength. It worked. The Soviet Union is no more, and now we\u2019re working to help them become totally democratic through the Freedom Support Act that I led on, a great Democratic ambassador, Bob Strauss, over there, Jim Baker, all of us got this thing passed \u2014 through cooperation, Ross \u2014 it worked with cooperation, and you\u2019re for that, I\u2019m sure, helping Russia become democratic. So the new world order to me means freedom and democracy, keep engaged, do not pull back into isolation. And we are the US, and we have a responsibility to lead and to guarantee the security. If it hadn\u2019t been for us, Saddam Hussein would be sitting on top of three-fifths of the oil supply of the world and he\u2019d have nuclear weapons. And only the US could do this.

It\u2019s being worked now in 1700 communities \u2014 bypassed Congress on this one, Ross \u2014 1700 communities across the country. It\u2019s called America 2000. And it literally says to the communities, re-invent the schools, not just the bricks and mortar but the curriculum and everything else. Think anew. We have a concept called the New American School Corporation where we\u2019re doing exactly that. And so I believe that we\u2019ve got to get the power in the hands of the teachers, not the teachers\u2019 union. What\u2019s happening up there? (Laughter) And so our America 2000 program also says this. It says let\u2019s give parents the choice of a public, private or public school \u2014 public, private or religious school. And it works- -it works in Milwaukee. Democratic woman up there \u2014 taking the lead in this. The mayor up there, on the program. And the schools that are not chosen are improved \u2014 competition does that. So we\u2019ve got to innovate through school choice. We\u2019ve got to innovate through this America 2000 program. But she is absolutely right. The programs that we\u2019ve been trying where you control everything and mandate it from Washington don\u2019t work. The governors \u2014 and I believe Governor Clinton was in on this \u2014 but maybe \u2014 I don\u2019t want to invoke him here. But they come to me and they say, please get the Congress to stop passing so many mandates telling us how to control things. We know better how to do it in California or Texas or wherever it is. So this is what our program is all about. And I believe you\u2019re right on to something, that if we don\u2019t change the education we\u2019re not going to be able to compete. Federal funding for education is up substantially \u2014 Pell grants are up. But it isn\u2019t going to get the job done if we don\u2019t change K through 12."}

Seventy percent of my state\u2019s money goes to the public schools, and I was really honored when Time magazine said that our schools have shown more improvement than any other state in the country except one other \u2014 they named 2 states showing real strides forward in the 80s. So I care a lot about this, and I\u2019ve spent countless hours in schools. But let me start with what you said. I agree with some of what Mr. Bush said, but it\u2019s nowhere near enough. We live in a world where what you earn depends on what you can learn, where the average 18- year-old will change jobs 8 times in a lifetime and where none of us can promise any of you that what you now do for a living is absolutely safe from now on. Nobody running can promise that, there\u2019s too much change in the world. So what should we do? Let me reel some things off real quick, because you said you wanted specifics. Number one, under my program we would provide matching funds to states to teach everybody with a job to read in the next 5 years and give everybody with a job the chance to get a high school diploma, in big places on the job. Number 2, we would provide 2-year apprenticeship programs to high school graduates who don\u2019t go to college. And community colleges are on the job. Number three, we\u2019d open the doors to college education to high school graduates without regard to income. They could borrow the money and pay it back as a percentage of their income or with a couple of years of service to our nation here at home. Number 4, we would fully fund the Head Start program to get little kids off to a good start. And, 5, I would have an aggressive program of school reform, more choices \u2014 I favor public schools or these new charter schools \u2014 we can talk about that if you want. I don\u2019t think we should spend tax money on private schools. But I favor public school choice, and I favor radical decentralization in giving more power to better-trained principals and teachers with parent councils to control their schools. Those things would revolutionize American education and take us to the top economically."}

And the first word you need to say in every city and state, and just draw a line in the sand, is public schools exist for the benefit of the children. You\u2019re going to see a lot of people fall over it, because any time you\u2019re spending $199 billion dollars a year, somebody\u2019s getting it. And the children get lost in the process. So that\u2019s step one. Keep in mind in 1960, when our schools were the envy of the world, we were spending $16 billion on them; now we spend more than any other nation in the world \u2014 199 billion a year \u2014 and rank at the bottom of the industrialized world in terms of education achievement. One more time you\u2019ve bought a front-row box seat and got a third-rate performance. This is a government that is not serving you. By and large it should be local \u2014 the more local, the better. Interesting phenomenon: small towns have good schools, big cities have terrible schools. The best people in a small town will serve on the school board; you get into big cities, it\u2019s political patronage, stepping stones \u2014 you get the job, give your relatives a janitor\u2019s job at $57,000 a year, more than the teachers make, and with luck they clean the cafeteria once a week. Now, you\u2019re paying for that. Those schools belong to you. And we put up with that. Now, as long as we put up with that, that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to get. And these folks are just dividing up 199 billion bucks and the children get lost. If I could wish for one thing for great public schools, it would be a strong family unit in every home \u2014 nothing will ever replace that. You say, well, gee, what are you going to do about that? Well, the White House is a bully pulpit, and I think we ought to be pounding on the table every day. There\u2019s nothing \u2014 the most efficient unit of government the world will ever know is a strong loving family unit. Next thing. You need small schools, not big schools. In a little school everybody is somebody; individualism is very important. These big factories? Everybody told me they were cost-effective. I did a study on it; they\u2019re cost- ineffective. 5000 students \u2014 why is a high school that big? One reason. Sooner or later you get 11 more boys that can run like the devil that weigh 250 pounds and they might win district. Now, that has nothing to do with learning. Secondly, across Texas, typically half of the school day was non-academic pursuits \u2014 in one place it was 35%. In Texas you could have unlimited absences to go to livestock shows. Found a boy \u2014 excuse me, but this gives the flavor \u2014 a boy in Houston kept a chicken in the bathtub in downtown Houston and missed 65 days going to livestock shows. Finally had to come back to school, the chicken lost its feathers. That\u2019s the only way we got him back. (Laughter) Now, that\u2019s your tax money being wasted. Now, neighborhood schools. It is terrible to bus tiny little children across town. And it is particularly terrible to take poor tiny little children and wait until the first grade and bus them across town to Mars, where the children know their numbers, know their letters, have had every advantage. At the end of the first day, that little child wants out. I\u2019ll close on this. You\u2019ve got to have world class teachers, world class books. If you ever got close to how textbooks were selected, you wouldn\u2019t want to go back the second day. I don\u2019t have time to tell you the stories."}

I do think there are special experiences and judgments and backgrounds and understandings that women bring to this process, by the way. This lady said here, how have you been affected by the economy. I mean, women know what\u2019s it like to be paid an unequal amount for equal work. They know what it\u2019s like not to have flexible working hours. They know what it\u2019s like not to have family leave or childcare. So I think it would be a good thing for America if it happened. And I think it will happen in my lifetime."}

Getting things done in three months that my competitors took 18 months to do. Everybody says you can\u2019t do that with Congress. Sure, you can do that with Congress. Congress \u2014 they\u2019re all good people. They\u2019re all patriots but you\u2019ve got to link arms and work with them. Sure, you\u2019ll have arguments. Sure, you\u2019ll have fights. We have them all day every day. But we get the job done. Now, I have to come back in my clothes to one thing because I am passionate about education. I was talking about early childhood education for disadvantaged little children. And let me tell you one specific pilot program where children who don\u2019t have a chance go to this program when they\u2019re 3. Now we\u2019re going back to when the mother\u2019s pregnant and they\u2019ll start right after they\u2019re born. Starting when they\u2019re 3 and going to this school until they\u2019re 9 and then going into the public school in the 4th grade. Ninety percent are on the honor role. Now that will change America. Those children will all go to college. They will live the American dream. And I beg the American people, any time they think about reforming education to take this piece of society that doesn\u2019t have a chance and take these little pieces of clay that can be shaped and molded and give them the same love and nurture and affection and support you give your children and teach them that they\u2019re unique and that they\u2019re precious and that there\u2019s only one person in the world like them and you will see this nation bloom. And we will have so many people who are qualified for the top job that it will be terrific. Now, finally, if you can\u2019t pay the bills you\u2019re dead in the water. And we have got to put our nation back to work. Now, if you don\u2019t want to really do that I\u2019m not your man. I\u2019d go crazy sitting up there slow dancing that one. In other words, unless we\u2019re going to do it, then pick somebody who likes to talk about it. Now, just remember when you think about me \u2014 I didn\u2019t create this mess. I\u2019ve been paying taxes just like you and Lord knows, I\u2019ve paid my share \u2014 over a billion in taxes.

They\u2019re not going to be solved overnight. But I want you to think about just 2 or 3 things. First of all, the people of my state have let me be their governor for 12 years because I made commitments to 2 things \u2014 more jobs and better schools. Our schools are now better. Our children get off to a better start from pre-school programs and smaller classes in the early grades, and we have one of the most aggressive adult education programs in the country. We talked about that. This year my state ranks first in the country in job growth, 4th in manufacturing in job growth, 4th in income growth, 4th in the decline of poverty. I\u2019m proud of that. It happened because I could work with people \u2014 Republicans and Democrats. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve had 24 retired generals and admirals, hundreds of business people, many of them Republican, support this campaign. You have to decide whether you want to change or not. We do not need 4 more years of an economic theory that doesn\u2019t work. We\u2019ve had 12 years of trickle down economics. It\u2019s time to put the American people first, to invest and grow this economy. I\u2019m the only person here who\u2019s ever balanced a government budget and I\u2019ve presented 12 of them and cut spending repeatedly. But you cannot just get there by balancing the budget. We\u2019ve got to grow the economy by putting people first \u2014 real people like you. I got into this race because I did not want my child to grow up to be part of the first generation of Americans to do worse than her parents. We\u2019re better than that. We can do better than that. I want to make America as great as it can be and I ask for your help in doing it. Thank you very much."}

I did everything I could to get General Motors to face its problems in the mid-\u201980s while it was still financially strong. They just wouldn\u2019t do it, and everybody now knows the terrible price they\u2019re paying by waiting until it\u2019s obvious to the brain-dead that they have problems. Now, hundreds, thousands of good, decent people, whole cities up here in this state are adversely impacted because they would not move in a timely way. Our government is that point now. The thing that I am in this race for is to tap the American people on the shoulder and to say to every single one of you, fix it while we\u2019re still relatively strong. If you have a heart problem, you don\u2019t wait till a heart attack to address it. So the General Motors experience is relevant. At the point when I could not get them to address those problems, I had created so much stress in the board, who wanted to just keep the Lawrence Welk music going, that they asked to buy my remaining shares. I sold them my remaining shares. They went their way. I went my way because it was obvious we had a complete disagreement about what should be done with the company. But let\u2019s take my life in perspective. Again and again, on complex, difficult tasks, I have stayed the course. When I was asked by our government to do the POW project, within a year the Vietnamese had sent people into Canada to make arrangements to have me and my family killed. And I had 5 small children, and my family and I decided we would stay the course, and we lived with that problem for 3 years. Then I got into the Texas War on Drugs program and the big-time drug dealers got all upset. Then when I had 2 people imprisoned in Iran, I could have left them there. I could have rationalized it. We went over, we got them out, we brought them back home. And since then, for years, I have lived with the burden of the Middle East, where it\u2019s eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth country, in terms of their unhappiness with the fact that I was successful in that effort. Again and again and again, in the middle of the night, at 2 or 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, my government has called me to take extraordinary steps for Americans in distress, and again and again and again I have responded. And I didn\u2019t wilt and I didn\u2019t quit. Now, what happened in July we\u2019ve covered again and again and again. But I think in terms of the American people\u2019s concern about my commitment, I\u2019m here tonight, folks; I never quit supporting you as you put me on the ballot in the other 26 states; and when you asked me to come back in, I came back in. And talk about not quitting, I\u2019m spending my money on this campaign; the 2 parties are spending your money, taxpayer money. I put my wallet on the table for you and your children. Over $60 million at least will go into this campaign to leave the American dream to you and your children, to get this country straightened out, because if anybody owes it to you, I do. I\u2019ve lived the American dream; I\u2019d like for your children to be able to live it, too. (Laughter)"}

I think what I\u2019d like to talk about a minute, since you\u2019re asking the question, is the General Motors issue. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that the automobile executives made some errors in the 1980s, but I also think we should look at how much productivity has increased lately, how much labor has done to increase productivity and how much management has done. And we\u2019re still losing a lot of auto jobs, in my judgment, because we don\u2019t have a national economic strategy that will build the industrial base of this country. Just today I met with the presidents and the vice presidents of the Willow Run union here, near here. They both said they were Vietnam veterans supporting me because I had an economic program to put them back to work. We need an investment incentive to modernize plant and equipment; we\u2019ve got to control the health care costs for those people \u2014 otherwise we can\u2019t keep the manufacturing jobs here; and we need a tough trade policy that is fair, that insists on open markets in return for open markets. We ought to have a strategy that will build the economic and industrial base. So I think Mr. Perot was right in questioning the management practices. But they didn\u2019t have much of a partner in government here as compared with the policies the Germans and the Japanese followed, and I believe we can do better. That\u2019s one of the things I want to change. I know that we can grow manufacturing jobs. We did it in my state, and we can do it nationally."}

And we ought to have to limit \u2014 we ought to have a much longer period of time, about 5 years, between the time when people can leave executive branch offices and then go out and start lobbying for foreign interests.

A lot of decent, honorable people felt as he did on the draft. But it\u2019s this pattern. And again, you might be able to make amendments all the time, Governor, but you\u2019ve got to, as president, you can\u2019t be on all these different sides, and you can\u2019t have this pattern of saying well, I did this or I didn\u2019t, then the facts come out and you change it. That\u2019s my big difference with him on the draft. It wasn\u2019t failing to serve."}

An African American was my chief economic development officer. It was interesting today. There was a story today or yesterday in the Washington Post about my economic programs and my chief budget officer and my chief economic officer were both African Americans, even though the Post didn\u2019t mention that, which I think is a sign of progress. The Natl Women\u2019s Political Caucus gave me an award, one of their Good Guy Awards, for my involvement of women in high levels of government, and I\u2019ve appointed more minorities to positions of high level in government than all the governors in the history of my state combined, before me.

And then after the Republican dirty tricks group got through with me I\u2019m another person, which I consider an absolutely sick operation. And all of you in the press know exactly what I\u2019m talking about. They investigated every single one of my children. They investigated my wife. They interviewed all of my children\u2019s friends from childhood on. They went to extraordinary sick lengths, and I just found it amusing that they would take 2 or 3 cases where I was involved in lawsuits and would engage an investigator \u2014 the lawyers would engage an investigator, which is common. And the only difference between me and any other businessman that has the range of businesses that I have is I haven\u2019t had that many lawsuits. So that\u2019s just another one of those little fruit-loopy things they make up to try to, instead of facing issues, to try to redefine a person that\u2019s running against them. This goes on night and day. I will do everything I can, if I get up there, to make dirty tricks a thing of the past. One of the 2 groups has raised it to an art form. It\u2019s a sick art form. Now, let\u2019s go back to Saddam Hussein. We gave Ambassador Glaspie written instructions. That\u2019s a fact. We\u2019ve never let the Congress and the Foreign Relations, Senate Intelligence Committees see them. That\u2019s a fact. Ambassador Glaspie did a lot of talking right after July 25 and that\u2019s a fact and it\u2019s in all the newspapers. And you pull all of it at once and read it and I did, and it\u2019s pretty clear what she and Kelly and the other key guys around that thing thought they were doing. Then at the end of the war, when they had to go testify about it, their stories are a total disconnect from what they said in August, September and October. So I say this is very simple. Saddam Hussein released a tape, as you know, claiming it was a transcript of their meeting, where she said we will not become involved in your border dispute and, in effect, you can take the northern part of the country. We later said no, that\u2019s not true. I said well, this is simple. What were her written instructions? We guard those like the secrets of the atomic bomb, literally. Now, I say whose country is this? This is ours. Who will get hurt if we lay those papers on the table? The worst thing is, again, it\u2019s a mistake. Nobody did any of this with evil intent. I just object to the fact that we cover up and hide things. Whether it\u2019s Iran-contra, Iraq-gate or you name it, it\u2019s a steady stream."}

And when he crossed the line, I stood up and looked into the camera and I said: This aggression will not stand. And we formed a historic coalition, and we brought him down, and we destroyed the 4th largest army. And the battlefield was searched, and there wasn\u2019t one single iota of evidence that any US weapons were on that battlefield. And the nuclear capability has been searched by the United Nations, and there hasn\u2019t been one single scintilla of evidence that there\u2019s any US technology involved in it. And what you\u2019re seeing on all this Iraq-gate is a bunch of people who were wrong on the war trying to cover their necks here and try to do a little revisionism. And I cannot let that stand, because it isn\u2019t true. Yes, we had grain credits for Iraq, and there isn\u2019t any evidence that those grain credits were diverted into weaponry \u2014 none, none whatsoever. And so I just have to say, it\u2019s fine. You can\u2019t stand there, Governor Clinton, and say, well, I think I\u2019d have been \u2014 I have supported the minority, let sanctions work or wish it would go away \u2014 but I would have voted with the majority.

On the other hand, I don\u2019t think that we have any reason to believe that the dimensions of this crisis are anywhere near as great as the savings and loan crisis. The mistake that both parties made in Washington with the S&L business was deregulating them without proper capital requirements, proper oversight and regulation, proper training of the executives. Many people predicted what happened, and it was a disaster. The banking system in this country is fundamentally sound with some weak banks. I think that our goal ought to be first of all not to politicize it, not to frighten people; secondly to say that we have to enforce the law in 2 ways. We don\u2019t want to overreact, as the federal regulators have in my judgment, on good banks so that they\u2019ve created credit crunches, that is, they have made our recession worse in the last couple of years \u2014 but we do want to act prudently with the banks that are in trouble. We also want to say that insofar as is humanly possible the banking industry itself should pay for the cost of any bank failures; the taxpayers should not. And that will be my policy. And I believe if we have a good balanced approach, we can get the good banks loaning money again, end the credit crunch, have proper regulation on the ones that are in trouble, and not overreact. It is a serious problem, but I don\u2019t see it as the kind of terrible, terrible problem that the S&L problem was."}

Now, in 1984 they were told. I believe the vice president was in charge of deregulation. Nobody touched that tar baby till the day after election in 1988 because they were flooding both parties with crooked PAC money, and it was in many cases stolen PAC money. Now, you and I never got a ride on a lot of these yachts and fancy things it bought, but you and I are paying for it. And they buried it till right after the election.

Look at the 24 generals and admirals, retired, that have endorsed me, including the deputy commander of Desert Storm. Look at Sarah Brady, Jim Brady\u2019s wife, President Reagan\u2019s press secretary, who endorsed me because he knuckled under to the NRA and wouldn\u2019t fight for the Brady Bill. We\u2019ve got a broad-based coalition that goes beyond party because I am going to change this country and make it better, with the help of the American people."}

I think the real winners of the debates were the American people. I was especially moved in Richmond a few days ago when 209 of our fellow citizens got to ask us questions. They went a long way toward reclaiming this election for the American people and taking their country back. I want to say, since this is the last time I\u2019ll be on a platform with my opponents, that even though I disagree with Mr. Perot on how fast we can reduce the deficit and how much we can increase taxes on the middle class, I really respect what he\u2019s done in this campaign to bring the issue of deficit reduction to our attention. I\u2019d like to say to Mr. Bush, even though I\u2019ve got profound differences with him, I do honor his service to our country. I appreciate his efforts and I wish him well. I just believe it\u2019s time to change. I offer a new approach. It\u2019s not trickle down economics. It\u2019s been tried for 12 years and it\u2019s failed. More people are working harder for less, 100,000 people a month losing their health insurance, unemployment going up, our economy slowing down. We can do better. And it\u2019s not tax and spend economics. It\u2019s invest and grow, put our people first, control health care costs and provide basic health care to all Americans, have an education system 2nd to none and revitalize the private economy. That is my commitment to you. It is the kind of change that can open up a whole new world of opportunities to America as we enter the last decade of this century and move towards the 21st century. I want a country where people who work hard and play by the rules are rewarded, not punished. I want a country where people are coming together across the lines of race and region and income. I know we can do better. It won\u2019t take miracles and it won\u2019t happen overnight, but we can do much, much better if we have the courage to change. Thank you very much."}

I believe that\u2019s the answer. I am proud to have been part of an administration that past the first catastrophic health bill. And in that there are some Medicaid provisions that will be very helpful to the very kind of people we\u2019re talking about here. But we\u2019ve got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work. So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program. It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then it also \u2013 I do not want to see us mandate across the board that every company has to do this, because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say, \u201cWe can\u2019t make it.\u201d And I think then you\u2019re going to see that people are put out of work.

There isn\u2019t any such thing as something free out there. It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work so the business can continue to compete. So, I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid system. I think we ought to do it by full enforcement of the catastrophic health insurance. I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience.

The problem, Mr. Bush, is that you\u2019ve cut back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and moderate income. And when you do that, you\u2019ve have homeless families. We didn\u2019t have two and a half million, or three million homeless people living on streets and in doorways in this country ten years ago. We\u2019ve got to begin to get back to the business of building and rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in this country; housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy. We\u2019ve got communities in this country increasingly where our own kids can\u2019t afford to live in the communities that they grew up in. That\u2019s an essential commitment. And I think the housing community is ready. But it\u2019s going to take a president who\u2019s committed to housing, who\u2019s had experience in building and rehabilitating housing who understands that affordable housing for families of low and moderate income, for young families, first time home buyers, is an essential part of the American dream. And while I\u2019m all for the McKinney bill, that, by itself, simply won\u2019t do. We\u2019ve got to have a president that can lead on this issue, that can work with the Congress, and I\u2019m prepared to do so.

The issue of abortion is a very difficult issue, one that I think that we all have to wrestle with, we have to come to terms with. I don\u2019t favor abortion. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good thing. I don\u2019t think most people do. The question is who makes the decision.

Sometimes people feel a little uncomfortable talking about this, but it\u2019s much clearer for me now. As I\u2019ve seen abortions sometimes used as a birth control device, for heavens sakes. See the millions of these killings accumulate, and this is one where you can have an honest difference of opinion. We certainly do.

But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible. That might be the explanation, if you tell me the program. I do strongly support the WIC program. I think it is good. I think part of the answer to this haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid, to challenge the states, and maybe we\u2019re going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of these. But, Peter, so much of it is, gets into a whole other phase of things. The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in, and that leads me to the programs I\u2019m talking about in terms of education. I think that part of it is the crime infested neighborhoods, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m a strong believer in trying to control crimes in the neighborhood, why I was so pleased to be endorsed by the policemen on the beat, the Boston Police Department the other day. I think they understand my commitment to helping them in the neighborhoods. And so it\u2019s a combination of these things. But do not erode out of the system the thousand points of light. The people that are out there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and schools, the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty. I\u2019m for Head Start and moving that up. And I\u2019ve already made a proposal \u2013 and yes, it will cost some money. But I favor that. So these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I don\u2019t think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program."}

It\u2019s cut federal aid to education; it\u2019s cut Pell grants and loans to close the door to college opportunity on youngsters all over this country. And that, too, is a major difference between the vice president and me. Let me just give you one other example. We have a great many people, hundreds of thousands of people living on public assistance in this country. The 50 governors of this nation have proposed to the Congress that we help those families to get off of welfare, help those youngsters, help their mothers to become independent and self-sufficient. It\u2019s taken months and months and months to get Mr. Bush and the administration to support that legislation, and they\u2019re still resisting. That\u2019s the way you help people.

Welfare reform is one way to do it. If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids don\u2019t lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of families, to get off of welfare, to become independent and self-sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives, the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children. That\u2019s just one example of how you can save money and improve the quality of life at the same time. In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very unwisely. One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance. Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he can\u2019t play little league ball that he can\u2019t go out on the ball field because he\u2019s afraid he\u2019s going to get hurt. And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I don\u2019t think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital. So these are the ways that you help families, you help youngsters to live better lives, and more decent lives. Were ready to go to work at the state and local level, all of us. I know the private sector is. People are all over the country. But it takes presidential leadership. It takes a commitment to being involved and the leading. And that\u2019s the kind of presidency I want to lead."}

The fact happens to be that education spending is up by the federal government; it is up. It is not down. But here\u2019s the point he misses. The federal government spends seven percent of the total on education, and the rest of the state governments and local governments and the thousand points of lightened I\u2019m talking about private schools and private church schools and things of this nature\u2013are putting up 93 percent.

And as I have said, age alone, although I can tell you, after the experiences of these last few week in the campaign, I\u2019ve added ten years to my age, age alone is not the only qualification. You\u2019ve got to look at experience, and you\u2019ve got to look at accomplishments, and can you make a difference. Have I made a difference in the United States Senate where I\u2019ve served for eight years? Yes, I have. Have I made a difference in the Congress that I\u2019ve served for 12 years? Yes, I have. As I said before, looking at the issue of qualifications \u2013 and I am delighted that it comes up, because on the three most important challenges facing America, arms control and national security, jobs and education and budget deficit, I have more experience and accomplishments than does the Governor of Massachusetts. I have been in the Congress and I\u2019ve worked on these issues. And believe me, when you look at arms control and trying to deal with the Soviet Union, you cannot come at it from a naive position. You have to understand the Soviet Union. You have to understand how they will respond. Sitting on that Senate Armed Services Committee for eight years has given me the experience to deal with the Soviet Union and how we can move forward. That is just one of the troubling issues that\u2019s going to be facing this nation, and I\u2019m prepared."}

We are using our military assets in a prudent way to deal with interdiction, and we\u2019ve made some success in this area. Seventy tons of cocaine have been stopped. But, you know, when you look at the drug problem \u2013 and it is a tremendous problem, and there are no easy solutions to it \u2013 it\u2019s a complicated problem, and it\u2019s heading up the effort to try to create a drug-free America, which is a challenge and a goal of all of us. Not only will we utilize national defense and the Department of Defense, but we\u2019ve got to get on the demand side of the ledger; we\u2019ve got to get to education. And education ought to begin at home, and it ought to be reinforced in our schools. And there\u2019s another thing that will be more important than the premise of this question on a hypothetical of using troops. We will use the military assets, we will use military assets \u2013 but we need to focus on another part of this problem, and that problem is law enforcement. And here is where we have a major disagreement with the governor of Massachusetts. He is opposed to the death penalty for drug kingpins. We believe people convicted of that crime deserve the death penalty, as does the legislation that\u2019s in the Congress that is supported by a bipartisan, including many Democrats of his party. He also was opposed to mandatory drug sentencing for drug dealers in the state of Massachusetts. You cannot have a war on drugs, you cannot be tough on drugs and weak on crime."}

And the way I would accomplish that\u2013was with a tough trade policy, opening up those markets, getting those prices back up to market prices. We can do that if we have an aggressive trade policy for our country, if we make trade a number one priority and not trade it off for some foreign policy objective at the moment. That means we have to stand up for the American farmers and that cuts back on the regulation on American farmers. That\u2019s a positive way to accomplish that. In addition to that, we do some of the things that I think have to be done insofar as doing a better job of procurement, particularly when we\u2019re talking about some of our military things that we should buy. I know that I fought very hard to put in an independent inspector general for the Defense Department, that the Senator from Indiana opposed me on that. But we were finally able to put that into effect and we saved over a quarter of a billion dollars this year, almost enough to buy a squadron of 716s. Those are the kids of things that I\u2019d work on. One of the things I learned in business is that you can expect what you inspect. So, we\u2019d be a \u2013 doing a much tougher job of auditing, to try to get rid of some of these kickbacks to consultants on military contracts, to be much more aggressive on that. In addition, those types of things would bring the interest rate down. I\u2019d try to turn this trade deficit around and that too would help us and help us very substantially. And I\u2019d get rid of some things like these planes that \u2013 are going to have \u2013 that the administration wants that\u2019ll fly from New York to Tokyo and take those investment bankers over there in four hours.

Senator Bentsen voted against Gramm-Rudman, the very tool that has been used to bring the Federal budget deficit down. We\u2019re going to need all the tools possible to bring this Federal budget deficit down. We need the tools of a line item veto. A line item veto that 43 governors in this country have, but not the President of the United States. The President of the United States needs to have a line item veto.

In the state of Massachusetts he has the homicide rate down to the lowest of any industrial state. It\u2019s substantially ahead of the national average. He\u2019s been able to do that with an educated program for the people of that state by adding some 1,500 new police officers; he\u2019s done it in turn by the leadership that I think he will bring to the ticket when he becomes president of the United States and fighting drugs. He\u2019s taken it down some four percent in the high schools of that state, while it\u2019s gone up about the rest of the nation.

And that\u2019s grossly unfair to the average American who is paying his taxes and paying them on time and doesn\u2019t have any alternative: it\u2019s taken out of his paycheck.

Now, I think if we work together on it, and if you have a president that will work with the Congress and the American people, we can bring that deficit down steadily, $20, $25, $30 billion a year, build economic growth, build a good strong future for America, invest in those things which we must invest in economic development, good jobs, good schools for our kids, college opportunity for young people, decent health care and affordable housing, and a clean and safe environment. We can do all of those things, and at the same time build a future in which we are standing on a good strong fiscal foundation. Senator Bentsen said, as you recall at the debate with Senator Quayle, that if you give any of us $200 billion worth of hot checks a year, we can create an illusion of prosperity. But sooner or later that credit card mentality isn\u2019t going to work.

I repeat, within days after you made that pledge, you broke it; you said, well, maybe as a last resort we\u2019ll do it. And you supported legislation this year that\u2019s involved tax increases not once, but twice. So that pledge isn\u2019t realistic, and I think the vice president knows it; I think the people of this country know it. The fact of the matter is that the next president of the United States is going to have to go to the White House seriously, he is going to have to work with the Congress seriously he can\u2019t turn to the Congress and blame them for the fact that we don\u2019t have a balanced budget and that we have billions and billions of dollars in red ink. And I am going to be a president who is serious, I hope and expect will be liked by the American people. But more than that, to do the kind of job that I\u2019m elected to do, will do it with as much good humor as I can, but at the same time will do it in a way which will achieve the goals we want for ourselves and our people. And I think we know what they are: a good strong future, a future in which there is opportunity for all of our citizens."}

I don\u2019t rule out modernization, and there are discussions going on now in the Congress, I know with the Pentagon, about a less expensive modernized land-based leg of the triad. But there are limits to what we can spend. There are limits to this nation\u2019s ability to finance these weapons systems. And one of the things that the Vice President either ignores or won\u2019t address is the fact that you can\u2019t divorce our military security from our economic security. How can we build a strong America militarily that\u2019s teeter-tottering on a mountain of debt? And if we go forward with the kinds of policies that the Vice President is suggesting tonight and has in the past, that debt is going to grow bigger and bigger and bigger. So military security and economic security go hand in hand. And we will have a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent. We\u2019re going to have conventional forces that are well maintained, well equipped, well trained, well supported. And we have serious problems with our conventional forces at the present time, and they\u2019ll get worse unless we have a president who is willing to make some of these decisions. And we also have important domestic priorities, in education and housing and health care, in economic development, in job training, in the environment. And all of these things are going to have to be addressed. That\u2019s why I say again to all of you out there who have to deal with your household budgets and know how difficult it is that the next President has to do the same. I want the men and women of our Armed Forces to have the support they need to defend us; the support they need when they risk our lives to keep us free and to keep this country free. But we cannot continue to live on a credit card. We cannot continue to tell the American people that we\u2019re going to build all of these systems, and at the same time, invest in important things here at home, and be serious about building a strong and good America.

I think of those young athletes who represented us at the Olympics were tremendously impressive. We were proud of them. We felt strongly about them, and they did so well by us. I can think of doctors and scientists, Jonas Salk who for example discovered a vaccine which cured one of the most dread diseases we ever had. And he\u2019s a hero. I think of classroom teachers, classroom teachers that I have had, classroom teachers that youngsters have today who are real heroes to our young people. Because they inspire them. They teach them. But more than that, they are role models. Members of the clergy who have done the same. Drug counselors out there in the street who are providing help to youngsters who come up to me and others who ask for help and want help, are doing the hard work, the heroic work, which it takes to provide that kind of leadership, that kind of counseling, that kind of support. I think of people in the law enforcement community who are taking their lives in their hands everyday, when they go up to one of those doors and kick it down and try to stop this flow of drugs into our communities and into our kids. So there are many, many heroes in this country today. These are people that give of themselves everyday and every week and every month. In many cases they are people in the community who are examples, and are role models. And I would hope that one of the things I could do as president is to recognize them, to give them the kind of recognition that they need and deserve so that more and more young people can themselves become the heroes of tomorrow, can go into public service, can go into teaching, can go into drug counseling, can go into law enforcement, and be heroes themselves to generations yet to come."}

And there\u2019s nothing corny about having sports heroes, young people that are clean and honorable and out there setting the pace. I think of Dr. Fauci. Probably never heard of him. You did, Ann heard of him. He\u2019s a very fine research, top doctor, at the National Institute of Health, working hard doing something about research on this disease of AIDS.

But we used that as a role model, the way he took understandable pride in his heritage, what his family means to him. And we\u2019ve got a strong family. And we watched that. And we said, hey, we\u2019ve got to unleash the Bush kids. And so you saw ten grandchildren there jumping all over their grandfather at the convention.

And I would say, I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s kind or not, it\u2019s just an objective statement. I think the man anybody that gets into this political arena and has to face you guys everyday deserves a word of praise. Because it\u2019s gotten a little ugly out there. It\u2019s gotten a little nasty. It\u2019s not much fun sometimes. And I would cite again Dan Quayle. I\u2019ve been in politics a long time, and I don\u2019t remember that kind of piling on, that kind of ugly rumor that never was true, printed. Now, come on. So some of it is unfair. But he\u2019s in the arena. Teddy Roosevelt used to talk about the arena, you know, daring to fail greatly or succeed, no matter. He\u2019s in there. So I salute these things. I salute those who participate in the political process. Sam Raybum had a great expression on this. He said here were all these intellectuals out there griping and complaining and saying it was negative coverage. Rayburn says, yeah, and that guy never ran for sheriff either.

I was over running records in west Texas, and I got a call from her, come home; went to the doctor; the doctor said, beautiful child, your child has a few weeks to live. And I said, what can we do about it. He said, no, she has leukemia, acute leukemia, a few weeks to live. We took the child to New York. Thanks to the miraculous sacrifice of doctors and nurses, the child stayed alive for six months and then died. If that child were here today, and I was told the same thing, my granddaughter, Noel for example that child could stay alive for ten or fifteen years, or maybe for the rest of her life.

But I do think this, that the next president, even within a relatively stable budget and that\u2019s what we are going to have for the foreseeable future will have to make those tough choices that I was talking about and that Mr. Bush doesn\u2019t seem to want to make. And that really is going to be a challenge for the next president of the United States; I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question about it. But I also see a tremendous opportunity now to negotiate with the Soviet Union to build on the progress that we\u2019ve made with the INF Treaty, which I strongly supported and most Democrats did to get those reductions in strategic weapons, to get a test ban treaty, and to really make progress on the reduction of conventional forces in Europe. And if we can do that and do it in a way that gets deeper cuts on the Soviet side, which is where they ought to come from, then I think we have an opportunity over the long haul to begin to move some of our resources from the military to important domestic priorities that can provide college opportunity for that young woman whose mother wrote me from Texas just the other day, from Longview, Texas: two teachers, a mother and a father who have a child that\u2019s a freshman in college, an electrical engineering major, a very bright student and they can\u2019t afford to keep that child in college. So I hope that we can begin to move those resources. It\u2019s not going to happen overnight; it certainly will have to happen on a step-by-step basis as we make progress in arms negotiation and arms control and arms reduction. But it certainly ought to be the long-term goal of all Americans and I think it is."}

And there are several there\u2019s a good political reason because it\u2019s just about this time of year that the Democrats start saying the Republicans are going to take away your Social Security.

I don\u2019t want that. And I will not go in there and suggest changes in Social Security. I learned that the hard way and the Governor and I both supported slipping the COLAs for one year. He supported it at the National Governors Conference and I supported it in breaking a tie in a major compromise package and we got assailed by the Democrats in the election over that. And I am going to keep that Social Security Trust Fund sound and keep our commitment to the elderly and maybe down the line, maybe when you get two decades or one into the next century, you\u2019re going to have to take another look at it, but not now.

But I do think there are flexible ways to solve some of the pressing problems, particularly that affect our children. And I have made some good sound proposals.

But as we look at the decisions that the next president of the United States is going to have to make, I just don\u2019t believe the place you go first is those programs, those so-called entitlements, which provide a basic floor of income and a modest amount of medical care for the elderly, the disabled, for people who can\u2019t make their way on their own, and in many cases, have given a great deal to this country. The Vice President did call Social Security a few years ago basically or largely a welfare program. It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a contract between generations. It\u2019s something that we pay into now so that we will have a secure retirement, and our parents and grandparents will have a secure retirement. It\u2019s a very sacred contract, and I believe in it. So that\u2019s not where we ought to go. There are plenty of places to cut.

How can Barry Goldwater sitting in Arizona know whether I\u2019m talking on the issues or not when we put out position paper after position paper, he puts out position paper after position paper; and we see this much about it, because everyone else is fascinated with polls and who\u2019s up or down today and who\u2019s going to be up or down tomorrow. So I think we can all share, with respect, in the fact that maybe the message is not getting out. But it\u2019s not getting out because there are too few debates. There will be no more debates.

And there are more, if you want to talk about percentage appointments, more Members of Congress who have been under investigation percentage-wise that people in the executive branch.

Any proposals that I made at that time were at the request of the chairman, a Democrat, of one of the leading committees, who said we have to do something before the program goes broke and the checks bounce. And so, we made a proposal. And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign. And 3 days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said, Social Security, we know, is broke. Indeed, we had to borrow $17 billion to pay the checks.

My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister. And I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve been born again, but I know I was born into a Christian family.

What bothers me is this growing tendency to try to use one\u2019s own personal interpretation of faith politically, to question others\u2019 faith, and to try to use the instrumentalities of government to impose those views on others.

This nation is the most religious nation on Earth \u2014 more people go to church and synagogues than any other nation on Earth \u2014 and it\u2019s because we kept the politicians and the state out of the personal exercise of our faith.

And they have been using these things to have government, through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion. A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they can\u2019t do it because it\u2019s school property. These are they types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation, and I am opposed to that.

We\u2019ll continue to try to get things that we didn\u2019t get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 6.1 percent, a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and State governments that has been unjustly seized by the Federal Government. And you might find those words in a Democratic platform of some years ago \u2014 I know, because I was a Democrat at that time. And I left the party eventually, because I could no longer follow the turn in the Democratic leadership that took us down an entirely different path, a path of centralizing authority in the Federal Government, lacking trust in the American people. I promised, when we took office, that we would reduce inflation. We have, to one-third of what it was. I promised that we would reduce taxes. We did, 25 percent across the board. That barely held even with \u2014 if it did that much \u2014 with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977. But at least it took that burden away from them. I said that we would create jobs for our people, and we did \u2014 6 million in the last 20 or 21 months. I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons. We have done that. All of the things that I said we would do, from inflation being down, interest rates being down, unemployment falling, all of those things we have done. And I think this is something the American people see. I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education \u2014 on excellence in education. And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems. We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth. All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.

With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it\u2019s a problem of the Constitution. I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us. And I think that this is what we should concentrate on, is trying \u2014 I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee, there were medical authorities, there were religious \u2014 there were clerics there \u2014 everyone talking about this matter of prolife. And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive. We have seen premature births that are now grown-up, happy people going around. Also, there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life. In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor \u2014 signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder. Now, isn\u2019t it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child, and it was abortion and not murder, but if somebody else does it, that\u2019s murder? And it used the term \u201cdeath of the unborn child.\u201d So, this has been my feeling about abortion, that we have a problem now to determine \u2014 and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being."}

That\u2019s why my proposal protects everybody from $25,000 a year or less against any tax increases, and treats those $70,000 and under in a way that is more beneficial than the way the President proposes with a sales tax or a flat tax. What does this mean in real life? Well, the other day, Vice President Bush disclosed his tax returns to the American people. He\u2019s one of the wealthiest Americans, and he\u2019s our Vice President. In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes. In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12.8 percent in taxes. That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work. I believe we need some fairness.

On the other hand, women heads of household \u2014 single women heads of household have \u2014 for the first time there\u2019s been a turndown in the rate of poverty for them. We have found also in our studies that in this increase in poverty, it all had to do with their private earnings. It had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs. We are spending now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980. We\u2019re spending a third more on all of the \u2014 well, all of the programs of human service. We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before \u2014 2,300,000 more are receiving them \u2014 even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them. We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits. We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy. Some time ago, Mr. Mondale said something about education and college students and help of that kind. Half \u2014 one out of two of the full-time college students in the United States are receiving some form of Federal aid. But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans. We didn\u2019t think that was right. And so, we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college, their family incomes were so low. So, there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been, taking care of more people than they ever have. 7.7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest 20 percent of earnings \u2014 7.7 million have moved up into another bracket since our administration took over, leaving only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there had been more than 13 million."}

Number two, we have to work with cities and others to help generate economic growth in those communities \u2014 through the Urban Development Action Grant Program. I don\u2019t mind those enterprise zones; let\u2019s try them, but not as a substitute for the others. Certainly education and training is crucial. If these young Americans don\u2019t have the skills that make them attractive to employees, they\u2019re not going to get jobs. The next thing is to try to get more entrepreneurship in business within the reach of minorities so that these businesses are located in the communities in which they\u2019re found. The other thing is, we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth. There is no question that the poor are worse off. I think the President genuinely believes that they\u2019re better off. But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago. How you can cut school lunches, how you can cut student assistance, how you can cut housing, how you can cut disability benefits, how you can do all of these things and then the people receiving them \u2014 for example, the disabled, who have no alternative \u2014 how they\u2019re going to do better, I don\u2019t know. Now, we need a tight budget, but there\u2019s no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and they\u2019re hurting. One final point if I might. There\u2019s another part of the lopsided economy that we\u2019re in today, and that is that these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports. We are now $120 billion of imports, 3 million jobs lost, and farmers are having their worst year. That\u2019s another reason to get the deficit down."}

I want to thank President Reagan for agreeing to debate. He didn\u2019t have to, and he did, and we all appreciate it. The President\u2019s favorite question is: Are you better off? Well, if you\u2019re wealthy, you\u2019re better off. If you\u2019re middle income, you\u2019re about where you were. And if you\u2019re modest income, you\u2019re worse off. That\u2019s what the economists tell us. But is that really the question that should be asked? Isn\u2019t the real question is will we be better off? Will our children be better off? Are we building the future that this nation needs? I believe that if we ask those questions that bear on our future, not just congratulate ourselves but challenge us to solve those problems, you\u2019ll see that we need new leadership. Are we better of with this arms race? Will we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens? Are we better off when we deemphasize our values in human rights? Are we better off when we load our children with this fantastic debt? Would fathers and mothers feel proud of themselves if they loaded their children with debts like this nation is now \u2014 over a trillion dollars on the shoulders of our children? Can we say, really say that we will be better off when we pull away from sort of that basic American instinct of decency and fairness? I would rather lose a campaign about decency than win a campaign about self-interest. I don\u2019t think this nation is composed of people who care only for themselves. And when we sought to assault Social Security and Medicare, as the record shows we did, I think that was mean-spirited. When we terminated 400,000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability \u2014 confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for 4 years, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what America is all about. America is a fair society, and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him. I believe there\u2019s fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system. I believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment. And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful. These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price. That\u2019s not fair for our future. I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training, because this world is more complex and we\u2019re being pressed harder all the time. I believe in opening doors. We won the Olympics, in part, because we\u2019ve had civil rights laws and the laws that prohibit discrimination against women. I have been for those efforts all my life. The President\u2019s record is quite different. The question is our future. President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, \u201cWe are great, but we can be greater.\u201d We can be better if we face our future, rejoice in our strengths, face our problems, and by solving them, build a better society for our children. Thank you."}

When we came into office, why, inflation was 21, 12 1\/2 percent interest was wiping out every single American were 21 1\/2 percent if you can believe it. Productivity was down. Savings was down. There was despair. In fact, the leadership of the country told the people that there was a malaise out there. And this president turned it around and I\u2019ve been with him every step of the way.

But I remember a statement of Lyndon Johnson\u2019s when he was looking around, why his party people weren\u2019t supporting him, and he said, \u201cHey, they painted their tails white and they ran with the antelopes.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of Democratic white tails running with the antelopes. Not one single Democrat has introduced the Mondale tax bill into the Congress. Of course I support the president\u2019s economic program and I support him in everything else.

I couldn\u2019t do that to Ronald Reagan, now, next year or any other time. I have too much trust in him. I have too much friendship for him. And I\u2019d feel very uncomfortable doing that."}

I\u2019m intrigued when I hear Vice-President Bush talk about his support of the president\u2019s economic program and how everything is just going so beautifully. I, too, recall when Vice President Bush was running in the primary against President Reagan and he called the program voodoo economics, and it was and it is. We are facing absolutely massive deficits; this administration has chosen to ignore it; the president has failed to put forth a plan to deal with those deficits and if everything believes that everything is corning up roses, perhaps the vice-president should join me as I travel around the country and speak to people. People in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, are not terribly thrilled with what\u2019s happening in the economy because they\u2019re standing in the light of a closed plant because they\u2019ve lost their jobs. The people in Youngstown, Ohio, have stores that are boarded up because the economy is not doing well. It\u2019s not only the old industries that are failing, it\u2019s also the new ones.

I think that\u2019s been something that\u2019s been handled by the courts, and not being handled by Congress and will not be handled by the White House. But we both support nondiscrimination in housing and integration of neighborhoods. The goals we both set forth. With reference to tuition tax credits, I have represented a district in Queens which is 70 percent Catholic. I represented my district. Let me say as well that I have also been a great supporter of public school education and that is something that Fritz and I feel very, very strongly about for the future of this country. And this administration over the past several years has gutted the educational programs available to our young people. It has attempted to knock out Pell Grants, which are monies to young individuals who are poor and who cannot afford to go to college. It has reduced by 25 percent the amount of monies going into college education and by a third those going into secondary and primary schools. But Fritz Mondale and I feel very strongly that if you educate your children that that\u2019s an effort and the way that you build up and make a stronger America. With reference to civil rights I think you\u2019ve got to go beyond that and if you take a look, also, at my record in the Congress and Fritz Mondale\u2019s record, both in the Senate and as vice president, we both have extremely strong civil rights records. This administration does not. It has come in in the Bob Jones on the side of segregated academies. It came in in the Grove City case on the side of discrimination against women, the handicapped, and the elderly. As a matter of fact, in the Congress we just passed overwhelmingly the Civil Rights Bill of 1984 and this administration, the Republican-controlled Senate, just killed it in the last week or two in Congress. So there is a real difference between how the Mondale-Ferraro administration will address the problems of civil rights and the failure of this administration specifically in that particular area."}

And, for example, when crime figures are going in the right direction that\u2019s good, that\u2019s a civil right. Similarly, we think of it in terms of quality of life, and that means interest rates. You know, it\u2019s funny, Mr. Mondale talks about real interest rates. The real interest rate is what you pay when you go down and try to buy a TV set or buy a car, or do whatever it is. The interest rates when we left office were 21% percent. Inflation! Is it a civil right to have the going right off the chart so you\u2019re busting every American family, those who can afford it the least? No, we\u2019ve got a good record.

I\u2019m taking it from the historical viewpoint, if you go back to the 1600s when people came here, the reason they came to this country was to escape religious persecution, and that\u2019s the same reason why people are coming here today in the 1940s to escape Nazism, now in the 1980s and 1984 when they can get our of the country to escape communism so they can come here and practice their religion. Our country is founded on the principle that our government should be neutral as far as religion is concerned.

What has happened over the past four years has been I think a real fudging of that line with the separation of church and state. The actions of the archbishops let me say to you I feel that they have not only a right but a responsibility to speak up, and even though I\u2019ve been the person that they\u2019re speaking up about, l feel they do have the responsibility to do so, and I have no problem with it, no more than I did a priest who marched at the time of Vietnam and no more than I did at the time when Martin Luther King marched at the time of the civil rights marches. I have absolutely no problem with them speaking up, I think they have an obligation as well as a right. But what I do have a problem with is when the president of the United States gets up in Dallas and addresses a group of individuals and said to them that anybody who doesn\u2019t support his constitutional amendment for prayer in the schools is intolerant of religion. Now there are numerous groups who don\u2019t support that prayer in the school, numerous religious groups. Are they intolerant of religion? Is that what the president is saying? I also object, when I am told, that the Reverend Falwell has been told that he would pick two of our Supreme Court justices. That\u2019s going a little bit far. In that instance, let me say to you it is more than a fudging at the line, it is a total intrusion, and I think that it\u2019s in violation of our Constitution."}

That year I happened to pay a lot of state and local taxes, which as you know are deducted from the other, and so I looked it up the other day, and we had paid \u2013 I think it\u2019s 42 percent \u2013 of our gross income in taxes. Now Mr. Mondale the other night took what I \u2013 I\u2019ll be honest \u2013 I think it was a cheap shot \u2013 at me, and we did a little looking around to see about his. We can\u2019t find his 198I tax return \u2013 it may have been released. Maybe my opponent knows whether Mr. Mondale released it. But we did find estimates that his income for those three years is a million, four hundred thousand dollars, and I think he paid about the same percentage as I did in total taxes. He also made a reference that troubled me very much, Mr. Boyd. He started talking about my chauffeur, and you know, I\u2019m driven to work by the Secret Service \u2013 so is Mrs. Ferraro \u2013 so is Mr. Mondale \u2013 they protected his life for four years and now they\u2019ve done a beautiful job for Barbara and mine. They saved the life of the president of the United States. I think that was a cheap shot \u2013 telling the American people to try to divide class \u2013 rich and poor. But the big question isn\u2019t whether Mrs. Ferraro is doing well. I think they\u2019re doing pretty well, and I know Barbara and I are doing well. And it\u2019s darn sure that Mr. Mondale is doing well, with a million four in income, but the question really is \u2013 after we get through this disclosure \u2013 is the tax cut fair? Are people getting a fair break, and the answer is the rich are paying 6 percent more on taxes and the poor are getting a better break. Those lower and middle-income people that have borne the burden for a long time. So yes, I favor disclosure. I\u2019ve always disclosed. This year I had my taxes and everything I own in a blind trust \u2013 so blind \u2013 blinder than the president\u2019s, so I didn\u2019t even sign my tax return. But there seemed to be an interest in it so we went to the government ethics committee \u2013 they agreed to change the trust. The trust has been revealed, and I was sure glad to see that I had paid 42 percent of my gross income in taxes."}

When you see Khomeini wraith his radical Islam resorting to government-sponsored terrorism, it\u2019s very difficult. The intelligence business can do a good job, and I\u2019m always one that defends the Central Intelligence Agency. I believe we ought to strengthen it and I believe we still have the best foreign intelligence business in the world. But it is very difficult to get the source information that you need to go after something as shadowy as international terror. There was a difference between Iran and what happened in Lebanon. In Iran you had a government holding a U.S. embassy; the government sanctioning the takeover of that embassy by those students; the government negotiating with the United States government for their release. In Lebanon, in the terror that happened at the embassy, you have the government there, Mr. Gemayel, that wants to help fight against terrorism. But because of the melee in the Middle East, it\u2019s there today and has been there yesterday and the day before, and everyone that\u2019s had experience in that area knows, it is a very different thing. So what we\u2019ve got to do is use absolutely the best security possible. I don\u2019t think you can go assigning blame. The president, of course, is the best I\u2019ve ever seen at accepting that. He\u2019s been wonderful about it in absolutely everything that happens. But I think fair-minded people that really understand international terror know that it\u2019s very hard to guard against. And the answer then really lies in the Middle East and terrorism happening all over the world, is a solution to the Palestine question, the follow on to Camp David under the umbrella of the Reagan September of 1982 initiative. That will reduce terror, it won\u2019t eliminate it."}

We had a good proposal, a moral proposal. Ban an entire generation of intermediate nuclear force weapons and if you won\u2019t do that, don\u2019t leave your allies in Europe in a monopoly position. The Soviets with 1,200 of these things, and the alliance with none. We didn\u2019t think that\u2019s the way to deter aggression and keep the peace.

And when the the strategic weapon and when the Soviets said, well, we don\u2019t like that proposal, we said all right, we\u2019ll be more flexible. I at the urging of the president went to Geneva and laid on the table a treaty to ban all chemical weapons. We don\u2019t want them to have a monopoly. We said look, let\u2019s come together. You come over here and see what we\u2019re doing; we\u2019ll go over there and see what you\u2019re doing. But let\u2019s save the kids of this world from chemical weapons.

In the mutual balance force reduction to reduce conventional forces, they\u2019re not even willing to tell us the base. Mrs. Ferraro knows that, and how many troops they have. There\u2019s four sessions. We have had an agreement with them on the hot line. But Carter-Monad made an agreement, the Salt II agreement, but the Democratic Senate, they were a Democratic administration, the Democratic Senate wouldn\u2019t even ratify that agreement. It was flawed, it was unverifiable and it was not good. Our president wants to reduce, not just to stop, he wants to reduce dramatically nuclear weapons. And when the Soviets know they\u2019re going to have this strong president to deal with, and when this new administration, Mr. Chernenko, given more than a few months in office can solidify its position, then they\u2019ll talk. But if they think the opposition, before they sit down, are going to give up the MX, give up the B-l, go for a freeze that locks in inferiority in Europe, all of these things, unilaterally, before they\u2019re willing to talk, they may just sweat it out for four more weeks.

Ronald Reagan and I have put our trust in the American people. We\u2019ve moved some of the power away from Washington, D.C., and put it back with the people. We\u2019re pulling together. The neighborhoods are safer \u2019cause crime is going down. Your sons and daughters are doing better in school. Test scores are going up.

It\u2019s a joy to serve with a president who does not apologize for the United States of America. Mr. Mondale, on the other hand, has one idea. Go out and tax the American people. And then he wants to repeal indexing, to wipe out the one protection that those at the lowest end of the economic scale have protecting them against being rammed into higher and higher tax brackets. We just owe our country too much to go back to that kind of an approach. I\u2019d like to say something to the young people. I started a business.

It is absolutely essential that we guarantee the young people that they will not know the agony of war. America\u2019s gift, opportunity and peace. Now we do have some unfinished business. We must continue to go ahead. The world is too complex to go back to vacillation and weakness. We\u2019ve too much going on to go back to the failed policies of the past.

I wouldn\u2019t be standing here if Fritz Mondale didn\u2019t have the courage and my party didn\u2019t stand for the values that it does \u2013 the values of fairness and equal opportunity. Those values make our country strong and the future of this country and how strong it will be is what this election is all about. Over the last two months I\u2019ve been traveling all over the country talking to the people about the future. I was in Kentucky and I spoke to the Dyhouse family. He works for a car dealer and he\u2019s worried about the deficits and how high interest rates are going to affect his job. Every place I go I see young parents with their children and they say to me what are we going to do to stop this nuclear arms race. I was in Dayton, Ohio, a week and a half ago and I sat with the Allen family who live next door to a toxic dump and they\u2019re very, very concerned about the fact that those toxics are seeping into the water that they and their neighbors drink. Now those people love this country and they\u2019re patriotic. But it\u2019s not the patriotism that you\u2019re seeing in the commercials as you watch television these days. Their patriotism is not only a pride in the country as it is, but a pride in this country that is strong enough to meet the challenges of the future. Do you know when we find jobs for the eight and a half million people who are unemployed in this country, you know we\u2019ll make our economy stronger and that will be a patriotic act. When we reduce the deficits and we cut interest rates, and I know the president doesn\u2019t believe that, but it\u2019s so \u2013 we cut those interest rates young people can buy houses, that\u2019s pro-family and that will be a patriotic act. When we educate our children \u2013 good Lord, they\u2019re going to be able to compete in a world economy and that makes us stronger and that\u2019s a patriotic act. When we stop the arms race, we make this a safer, saner world, and that\u2019s a patriotic act, and when we keep the peace young men don\u2019t die, and that\u2019s a patriotic act. Those are the keys to the future and who can be the leader for the future? When Walter Mondale was attorney general of Minnesota, he led the fight for a man who could not afford to get justice because he couldn\u2019t afford a lawyer; when he was in the Senate he fought for child nutrition programs, he wrote the Fair Housing Act, he even investigated the concerns and the abuses of migrant workers. And why did he do that? Those weren\u2019t popular causes. You know, no one had ever heard of Clarence Gideon, the man without a lawyer. Children don\u2019t vote and migrant workers exactly a powerful lobby in this country, but he did it because it was right. Fritz Mondale has said that he would rather lose a battle for decency than win one over self-interest. Now I agree with him. This campaign is not over. For our country, for our future, for the principles we believe in Walter Mondale and I have just begun to fight."}

I have no illusions about the Soviet Union leadership or the nature of that state. They are a tough and a ruthless adversary, and we must be prepared to meet that challenge, and I would.

And that\u2019s where the President has opposed practically every arms control agreement, by every President, of both political parties, since the bomb went off. And he now completes this term with no progress toward arms control at all, but with a very dangerous arms race underway instead. There are now over 2,000 more warheads pointed at us today than there were when he was sworn in, and that does not strengthen us. We must be very, very realistic in the nature of that leadership, but we must grind away and talk to find ways of reducing these differences, particularly where arms races are concerned and other dangerous exercises of Soviet power. There will be no unilateral disarmament under my administration. I will keep this nation strong. I understand exactly what the Soviets are up to, but that, too, is a part of national strength. To do that, a President must know what is essential to command and to leadership and to strength. And that\u2019s where the President\u2019s failure to master, in my opinion, the essential elements of arms control has cost us dearly. He\u2019s 3 years into this administration.

Both said that this administration turned down the \u201cwalk in the woods\u201d agreement first, and that would have been a perfect agreement from the standpoint of the United States in Europe and our security. When Mr. Nitze, a good negotiator, returned, he was rebuked, and his boss was fired. This is the kind of leadership that we\u2019ve had in this administration on the most deadly issue of our times. Now we have a runaway arms race. All they\u2019ve got to show for 4 years in U.S.-Soviet relations is one meeting in the last weeks of an administration, and nothing before. They\u2019re tough negotiators, but all previous Presidents have made progress. This one has not."}

However, there were things added in in the House side that we felt made it less of a good bill; as a matter of fact, made it a bad bill. And in conference \u2014 we stayed with them in conference all the way to where even Senator Simpson did not want the bill in the manner in which it would come out of the conference committee. There were a number of things in there that weakened that bill. I can\u2019t go into detail about them here. But it is true our borders are out of control. It is also true that this has been a situation on our borders back through a number of administrations. And I supported this bill. I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though sometime back they may have entered illegally. With regard to the employer sanctions, we must have that not only to ensure that we can identify the illegal aliens, but also, while some keep protesting about what it would do to employers, there is another employer that we shouldn\u2019t be so concerned about, and these are employers down through the years who have encouraged the illegal entry into this country because they then hire these individuals and hire them at starvation wages and with none of the benefits that we think are normal and natural for workers in our country, and the individuals can\u2019t complain because of their illegal status. We don\u2019t think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free. And this was why the provisions that we had in with regard to sanctions, and so forth \u2014 and I\u2019m going to do everything I can, and all of us in the administration are, to join in again when Congress is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us, once again, control of our borders. And with regard to friendship below the border and with the countries down there, yes, no administration that I know has established the relationship that we have with our Latin friends. But as long as they have an economy that leaves so many people in dire poverty and unemployment, they are going to seek that employment across our borders. And we work with those other countries."}

We have had for many years, understandably, a system of restraints on high technology because the Soviets are behind us. And any research or development along the Star Wars schemes would inevitably involve our most advanced computers, our most advanced engineering. And the thought that we would share this with the Soviet Union is, in my opinion, a total non-STARTer. I would not let the Soviet Union get their hands on it at all. Now, what\u2019s wrong with Star Wars? There\u2019s nothing wrong with the theory of it. If we could develop a principle that would say both sides could fire all their missiles and no one would get hurt, I suppose it\u2019s a good idea. But the fact of it is we\u2019re so far away from research that even comes close to that, that the Director of Engineering Research at the Defense Department said to get there we would have to solve eight problems, each of which are more difficult than the atomic bomb and the Manhattan project. It would cost something like a trillion dollars to test and deploy weapons. The second thing is this all assumes that the Soviets wouldn\u2019t respond in kind. And they always do. We don\u2019t get behind. They won\u2019t get behind. And that\u2019s been the tragic story of the arms race. We have more at stake in space satellites than they do. If we could stop, right now, the testing and the deployment of these space weapons \u2014 and the President\u2019s proposals go clear beyond research; if it was just research we wouldn\u2019t have any argument, because maybe someday, somebody will think of something \u2014 but to commit this nation to a buildup of antisatellite and space weapons at this time, in their crude state, would bring about an arms race that\u2019s very dangerous indeed. One final point. The most dangerous aspect of this proposal is, for the first time, we would delegate to computers the decision as to whether to start a war. That\u2019s dead wrong. There wouldn\u2019t be time for a President to decide; it would be decided by these remote computers. It might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer might decide it\u2019s a missile \u2014 and off we go.

And I am not at all convinced that he was that far out of line with his people or that they wanted that to happen. The Shah had done our bidding and carried our load in the Middle East for quite some time, and I did think that it was a blot on our record that we let him down. Have things gotten better? The Shah, whatever he might have done, was building low-cost housing, had taken land away from the Mullahs and was distributing it to the peasants so they could be landowners \u2014 things of that kind. But we turned it over to a maniacal fanatic who has slaughtered thousands and thousands of people, calling it executions. The matter of Somoza \u2014 no, I never defended Somoza. And, as a matter of fact, the previous administration stood by and so did I \u2014 not that I could have done anything in my position at that time \u2014 but for this revolution to take place. And the promise of the revolution was democracy, human rights, free labor unions, free press. And then, just as Castro had done in Cuba, the Sandinistas ousted the other parties to the revolution. Many of them are now the contras. They exiled some, they jailed some, they murdered some. And they installed a Marxist-Leninist totalitarian government. And what I have to say about this is, many times \u2014 and this has to do with the Philippines, also, I know there are things there in the Philippines that do not look good to us from the standpoint right now of democratic rights, but what is the alternative? It is a large Communist movement to take over the Philippines. They have been our friend since their inception as a nation. And I think that we\u2019ve had enough of a record of letting \u2014 under the guise of revolution \u2014 someone that we thought was a little more right than we would be, letting that person go, and then winding up with totalitarianism, pure and simple, as the alternative.

This evening we talked about national strength. I believe we need to be strong, and I will keep us strong. But I think strength must also require wisdom and smarts in its exercise. That\u2019s key to the strength of our nation. A President must know the essential facts essential to command. But a President must also have a vision of where this nation should go. Tonight, as Americans, you have a choice. And you\u2019re entitled to know where we would take this country if you decide to elect us. As President, I would press for long-term, vigorous economic growth. That\u2019s why I want to get these debts down and these interest rates down, restore America\u2019s exports, help rural America, which is suffering so much, and bring the jobs back here for our children. I want this next generation to be the best educated in American history, to invest in the human mind and science again, so we\u2019re out front. I want this nation to protect its air, its water, its land, and its public health. America is not temporary; we\u2019re forever. And as Americans, our generation should protect this wonderful land for our children. I want a nation of fairness, where no one is denied the fullness of life or discriminated against, and we deal compassionately with those in our midst who are in trouble. And, above all, I want a nation that\u2019s strong. Since we debated 2 weeks ago, the United States and the Soviet Union have built a hundred more warheads, enough to kill millions of Americans and millions of Soviet citizens. This doesn\u2019t strengthen us. This weakens the chances of civilization to survive. I remember the night before I became Vice President. I was given the briefing and told that any time, night or day, I might be called upon to make the most fateful decision on Earth \u2014 whether to fire these atomic weapons that could destroy the human species. That lesson tells us two things: One, pick a President that you know will know if that tragic moment ever comes what he must know, because there\u2019ll be no time for staffing committees or advisers. A President must know right then. But above all, pick a President who will fight to avoid the day when that God-awful decision ever needs to be made. And that\u2019s why this election is so terribly important. America and Americans decide not just what\u2019s happening in this country. We are the strongest and most powerful free society on Earth. When you make that judgment, you are deciding not only the future of our nation; in a very profound respect, you\u2019re deciding the future of the world. We need to move on. It\u2019s time for America to find new leadership. Please, join me in this cause to move confidently and with a sense of assurance and command to build the blessed future of our nation."}

My thanks to the League of Women Voters, to the panelists, the moderator, and to the people of Kansas City for their warm hospitality and greeting. I think the American people tonight have much to be grateful for \u2014 an economic recovery that has become expansion, freedom and, most of all, we are at peace. I am grateful for the chance to reaffirm my commitment to reduce nuclear weapons and, one day, to eliminate them entirely. The question before you comes down to this - Do you want to see America return to the policies of weakness of the last 4 years? Or do we want to go forward, marching together, as a nation of strength and that\u2019s going to continue to be strong? We shouldn\u2019t be dwelling on the past, or even the present. The meaning of this election is the future and whether we\u2019re going to grow and provide the jobs and the opportunities for all Americans and that they need. Several years ago, I was given an assignment to write a letter. It was to go into a time capsule and would be read in 100 years when that time capsule was opened. I remember driving down the California coast one day. My mind was full of what I was going to put in that letter about the problems and the issues that confront us in our time and what we did about them. But I couldn\u2019t completely neglect the beauty around me \u2014 the Pacific out there on one side of the highway, shining in the sunlight, the mountains of the coast range rising on the other side. And I found myself wondering what it would be like for someone \u2014 wondering if someone 100 years from now would be driving down that highway, and if they would see the same thing. And with that thought, I realized what a job I had with that letter. I would be writing a letter to people who know everything there is to know about us. We know nothing about them. They would know all about our problems. They would know how we solved them, and whether our solution was beneficial to them down through the years or whether it hurt them. They would also know that we lived in a world with terrible weapons, nuclear weapons of terrible destructive power, aimed at each other, capable of crossing the ocean in a matter of minutes and destroying civilization as we knew it. And then I thought to myself, what are they going to say about us, what are those people 100 years from now going to think? They will know whether we used those weapons or not. Well, what they will say about us 100 years from now depends on how we keep our rendezvous with destiny. Will we do the things that we know must be done and know that one day, down in history 100 years or perhaps before, someone will say, \u201cThank God for those people back in the 1980\u2019s for preserving our freedom, for saving for us this blessed planet called Earth, with all its grandeur and its beauty.\u201d You know, I am grateful to all of you for giving me the opportunity to serve you for these 4 years, and I seek reelection because I want more than anything else to try to complete the new beginning that we charted 4 years ago. George Bush, who I think is one of the finest Vice Presidents this country has ever had \u2014 George Bush and I have crisscrossed the country, and we\u2019ve had, in these last few months, a wonderful experience. We have met young America. We have met your sons and daughters."}

I. too, believe in the voluntary military. As a matter of fact, today the shortages of non-commissioned officers that John mentioned are such that if we tried to have a draft today, we wouldn\u2019t have the non-commissioned officers to train the draftees. I believe the answer lies in just recognizing human nature and how we make everything else work in this country, when we want it to work. Recognize that we have a voluntary military. We are asking for men and women to join the military as a career, and we\u2019re asking them to deal with the most sophisticated of equipment. And a young man is out there on a $1 billion carrier in charge of the maintenance of a $20 million aircraft, working 100 hours a week at times, and he\u2019s earning less for himself and his family, while he\u2019s away from his family, than he could earn if he were in one of the most menial jobs, working 40 hours a week here at home. As an aid to enlistment. we had an aid \u2013 46% of the people who enlisted in the voluntary military up until 1977 said they did so for one particular reason, the G.I. Bill of Rights \u2013 the fact that, by serving in the military, they could provide for a future college education. In 1977, we took that away from the military. That meant immediately 46% of your people that were signing up had no reason for signing up. So I think it is a case of pay scale, of recognizing that if we\u2019re going to have young men and women responsible for our security, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heaven\u2019s sakes, let\u2019s go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that we\u2019re asking of them. Along with this, I think we need something else that has been allowed to deteriorate. We need a million-man active reserve that could be called up on an instant\u2019s notice, and that would be also trained, ready to use that type of equipment. Both of these, I think, would respond to the proper kind of incentives that we could offer these people. The other day, I just \u2013 I\u2019ll hasten \u2013 I just saw one example. Down in Texas. I saw a high school that is military."}

We need the missile, I think, because we are so out of balance strategically that we lack a deterrent to a possible first assault. But I am not in favor of the plan that is so costly. And therefore, if I only had another second left, I\u2019d say that that high school class in a military training \u2013 40 of its 80 graduates last year entered the United States service academies; West Point, Annapolis and the Air Force Academy, and to see those young men made me very proud to realize that there are young people in this country that are prepared to go into that kind of a career in service of their country."}

It seems to totally belie the claim that I heard President Carter make a few days ago, that he was the first President that had come forth with a real urban strategy to meet the problems of urban America. Incidentally, just this past week, the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen, I guess, because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits. I\u2019m happy to say that, in contrast to that, the Anderson-Lucey platform for America, program for the 80s, has devoted considerable time, and in very specific detail, we have talked about two things that ought to be done to aid urban America. We call, first of all, for the creation of a $4 billion urban reinvestment trust fund to do exactly what you spoke about in your question \u2013 to rebuild the streets, to rebuild the cities, the leaking water mains. I was in North Pittsburgh \u2013 I think it was a few weeks ago, on my campaign \u2013 the water mains in that city had begun to leak, and literally, there wasn\u2019t money available to fix them. And until we can begin to recreate the basic infrastructure of the great cities of America, particularly in the upper Midwest and in the Northeast, they simply are not going to provide the kind of economic climate that will enable them to retain industry, enable them to retain the kind of solid industrial base that they need, so that they can provide jobs. We have also provided in our program for a $4 billion Community Trust Fund, and we\u2019ve told you where the money is coming from. It\u2019s going to come from the dedication, by 1984, of the excise revenues that today are being collected by the Federal Government on alcohol and tobacco. That money, I think, ought to be put into rebuilding the base of our cities. In addition to that, jobs programs to re-employ the youth in our cities would be very high on my priority list, both the Youth Opportunities Act of 1980 and a billion-dollar program that I would recommend to put youth to work in energy projects, in conservation projects, in projects that would carry out some of the great national goals of our country."}

When these Presidential Debates were held just four years ago, I remember the incumbent President, who was willing to debate, President Ford, telling the American people that they simply ought not to vote for somebody who promised more than they could deliver. Well, we\u2019ve seen what has happened. We haven\u2019t gotten either the economies in Government that were promised; we haven\u2019t gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carter\u2019s first term. Instead we had, I think, in the second quarter, a Consumer Price Index registering around 12%. And nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the Wholesale Price Index \u2013 that\u2019s about 18% on an annualized basis \u2013 what it\u2019s going to be. Let me say this. I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan. His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information. He went so far as to call it \u201cbrutal economics.\u201d I\u2019ve been very careful \u2013 I have been very careful in saying that what I\u2019m going to do is to bring Federal spending under control first. I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done. But, you know, it\u2019s gotten to be about $122 difference. Somebody worked it out. And they figured out that between the tax cut that Governor Reagan is promising the American people, and the tax cut that Jimmy Carter is promising in 198I, his is worth about $122 more. So you, dear voters, are out there on the auction block, and these two candidates are bidding for your votes. And one is going to give you $122 more if you happen to be in that range of about a $20,000-a-year income. I\u2019m going to wait until I see that that inflation rate is going down, before I even begin to phase in the business tax cuts that I\u2019ve talked about. But I think, by improving productivity, they would be far less inflationary than the consumption-oriented tax cut that Governor Reagan is recommending."}

We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures. And we used \u2013 yes, we used \u2013 the Senate Budget Committee\u2019s projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5% \u2013 which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated. And eliminated probably more quickly than our plan, but we wanted to be so conservative with it, that people would see how. how well it could be done. Now, John\u2019s been in the Congress for 20 years. And John tells us that first, we\u2019ve got to reduce spending before we can reduce taxes. Well, if you\u2019ve got a kid that\u2019s extravagant, you can lecture him all you want to about his extravagance. Or you can cut his allowance and achieve the same end much quicker. But Government has never reduced Government does not tax to get the money it needs. Government always needs the money it gets. And when John talks about his non-inflationary plan, as far as I have been able to learn, there are 88 proposals in it that call for additional Government spending programs. Now, I speak with some confidence of our plan, because I took over a state \u2013 California \u2013 10% of the population of this nation \u2013 a state that, if it were a nation, would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world. And that state we controlled spending. We cut the rate of increase in spending in half. But at the same time, we gave back to the people of California \u2013 in tax rebates, tax credits, tax cuts \u2013 $5.7 billion. I vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned. And among those vetoes, I stopped $16 billion in additional spending. And the funny thing was that California, which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment, for those six years for the first time, was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment. We have considered inflation in our figures. We deliberately took figures that we, ourselves, believed were too conservative. I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983, and it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s counting on for his plan. But he\u2019s going to get a half-a-trillion dollars more over the next five years that he can use for additional programs, or hopefully, someplace down the line, balancing the budget. We believe that that\u2019s too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people."}

Our Government, in its most sacred documents \u2013 the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and all \u2013 speak of man being created, of a Creator. That we\u2019re a nation under God. Now, I have thought for a long time that too many of our churches have been too reluctant to speak up in behalf of what they believe is proper in Government, and they have been too too lax in interfering, in recent years, with Government\u2019s invasion of the family itself, putting itself between parent and child. I vetoed a number of bills of that kind myself, when I was in California. Now, whether it is rightful, on a single issue, for anyone to advocate that someone should not be elected or not, I won\u2019t take a position on that. But I do believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to express themselves, or to even try to persuade others to follow their leader. That\u2019s what elections are all about."}

But to try, as occurred in the case that you mentioned \u2013 that specific case \u2013 to try to tell the parishioners of any church, of any denomination, how they should vote, or for whom they should vote, I think violates the principle of separation of church and state. Now, Governor Reagan is running on a platform that calls for a Constitutional amendment banning abortion. I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual. And for the state to interfere with a Constitutional amendment, and tell a woman that she must carry that pregnancy to term, regardless of her personal belief, that, I think, violates freedom of conscience as much as anything that I can think of. And he is also running on a platform that suggests a litmus test for the selection of judges \u2013 that only judges that hold a certain, quote, \u201cview,\u201d on the sanctity of family life, ought to be appointed to the Federal Judiciary, one of the three great independent branches of our Government. No. I believe in freedom of choice. I don\u2019t believe in Constitutional Amendments that would interfere with that. I don\u2019t believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the Federal Judiciary. On the Amendment that you mentioned, I abandoned it 15 years ago.

But for me to try, in this very pluralistic society of ours, to try to frame any definition, whatever, of what that belief should be, is wrong.

And there might be some feeling of unfairness about this because he was not here to respond. But I believe it would have been much more unfair to have had John Anderson denied the right to participate in this debate. And I want to express my appreciation to the League of Women Voters for adopting a course with which I believe the great majority of Americans are in agreement. Now, as to my closing remarks: I\u2019ve always believed that this land was placed here between the two great oceans by some divine plan. That it was placed here to be found by a special kind of people \u2013 people who had a special love for freedom and who had the courage to uproot themselves and leave hearth and homeland, and came to what, in the beginning, was the most undeveloped wilderness possible. We came from 100 different corners of the earth. We spoke a multitude of tongues. We landed on this Eastern shore and then went out over the mountains and the prairies and the deserts and the far western mountains to the Pacific, building cities and towns and farms, and schools and churches. If wind, water or fire destroyed them, we built them again. And in so doing, at the same time, we built a new breed of human called an American \u2013 a proud, an independent., and a most compassionate individual, for the most part. Two hundred years ago, Tom Paine, when the 13 tiny colonies were trying to become a nation, said, we have it in our power to begin the world over again. Today. we\u2019re confronted with the horrendous problems that we\u2019ve discussed here tonight. And some people in high positions of leadership, tell us that the answer is to retreat. That the best is over. That we must cut back. That we must share in an ever-increasing scarcity. That we must, in the failure to be able to protect our national security as it is today, we must not be provocative to any possible adversary. Well, we, the living Americans, have gone through four wars. We\u2019ve gone through a Great Depression in our lifetime that literally was worldwide and almost brought us to our knees. But we came through all of those things and we achieved even new heights and new greatness. The living Americans today have fought harder, paid a higher price for freedom, and done more to advance the dignity of man than any people who ever lived on this earth. For 200 years, we\u2019ve lived in the future, believing that tomorrow would be better than today, and today would be better than yesterday. I still believe that. I\u2019m not running for the Presidency because I believe that I can solve the problems we\u2019ve discussed tonight. I believe the people of this country can, and together, we can begin the world over again. We can meet our destiny \u2013 and that destiny to build a land here that will be, for all mankind, a shining city on a hill. I think we ought to get at it."}

I think you\u2019ve seen tonight in this debate that Governor Reagan and I have agreed on exactly one thing \u2013 we are both against the reimposition of a peacetime draft. We have disagreed, I believe, on virtually every other issue. I respect him for showing tonight \u2013 for appearing here, and I thank the League of Women Voters for the opportunity that they have given me. I am running for President as an Independent because I believe our country is in trouble. I believe that all of us are going to have to begin to work together to solve our problems. If you think that I am a spoiler, consider these facts: Do you really think that our economy is healthy? Do you really think that 8 million Americans being out of work and the 50% unemployment among the youth of our country are acceptable? Do you really think that our armed forces are really acceptably strong in those areas of conventional capability where they should be? Do you think that our political institutions are working the way they should when literally only half of our citizens vote? I don\u2019t think you do think that. And therefore, I think you ought to consider doing something about it, and voting for an Independent in 1980. You know, a generation of office seekers has tried to tell the American people that they could get something for nothing. It\u2019s been a time, therefore, of illusion and false hopes, and the longer it continues, the more dangerous it becomes. We\u2019ve got to stop drifting. What I wish tonight so desperately is that we had had more time to talk about some of the other issues that are so fundamentally important. A great historian, Henry Steele Commager, said that in their lust for victory, neither traditional party is looking beyond November. And he went on to cite three issues that their platforms totally ignore: atomic warfare, Presidential Directive 59 notwithstanding. If we don\u2019t resolve that issue, all others become irrelevant. The issue of our natural resources; the right of posterity to inherit the earth, and what kind of earth will it be? The issue of nationalism \u2013 the recognition, he says, that every major problem confronting us is global, and cannot be solved by nationalism here or elsewhere \u2013 that is chauvinistic, that is parochial, that is as anachronistic as states\u2019 rights was in the days of Jefferson Davis. Those are some of the great issues \u2013 atomic warfare, the use of our natural resources, and the issue of nationalism \u2013 that I intend to be talking about in the remaining six weeks of this campaign, and I dare hope that the American people will be listening and that they will see that an Independent government of John Anderson and Patrick Lucey can give us the kind of coalition government that we need in 1980 to begin to solve our problems. Thank you."}

I\u2019ve also learned that there are no simple answers to complicated questions. H. L. Mencken said that for every problem there\u2019s a simple answer. It would be neat and plausible and wrong. The fact is that this nation, in the eight years before I became President, had its own military strength decreased. Seven out of eight years, the budget commitments for defense went down, 37% in all. Since I\u2019ve been in office, we\u2019ve had a steady, carefully planned, methodical but, very effective increase in our commitment for defense. But what we\u2019ve done is use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace. We\u2019ve not only kept peace for our own country, but we\u2019ve been able to extend the benefits of peace to others. In the Middle East, we\u2019ve worked for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, successfully, and have tied ourselves together with Israel and Egypt in a common defense capability. This is a very good step forward for our nation\u2019s security, and we\u2019ll continue to do as we have done in the past. I might also add that there are decisions that are made in the Oval Office by every President which are profound in nature. There are always trouble spots in the world, and how those troubled areas are addressed by a President alone in that Oval Office affects our nation directly, the involvement of the United States and also our American interests. That is a basic decision that has to be made so frequently, by every President who serves. That is what I have tried to do successfully by keeping our country at peace."}

We have a program for a gradual reduction of Government spending based on these theories, and I have a task force now that has been working on where those cuts could be made. I\u2019m confident that it can be done and that it will reduce inflation because I did it in California.

And then, through tax incentives, induce the creation of businesses providing jobs and so forth in those areas. The elements of government through these tax incentives For example, a business that would not have, for a period of time, an increase in the property tax reflecting its development of the unused property that it was making wouldn\u2019t be any loss to the city because the city isn\u2019t getting any tax from that now.

When I was campaigning in 1976, everywhere I went, the mayors and local officials were in despair about the rapidly deteriorating central cities of our nation. We initiated a very fine urban renewal program, working with the mayors, the governors, and other interested officials. This has been a very successful effort. That\u2019s one of the main reasons that we\u2019ve had such an increase in the number of people employed. Of the nine million people put to work in new jobs since I\u2019ve been in office, 1.3 million of those has been among black Americans, and another million among those who speak Spanish. We now are planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of rapid transit, mass transit. Under the windfall profits tax, we expect to spend about $43 billion in the next 10 years to rebuild the transportation systems of our country. We also are pursuing housing programs. We\u2019ve had a 73% increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education. These are the kinds of efforts worked on a joint basis with community leaders, particularly in the minority areas of the central cities that have been deteriorating so rapidly in the past. It\u2019s very important to us that this be done with the full involvement of minority citizens. I have brought into the top level, top levels of government, into the White House, into administrative offices of the Executive branch, into the judicial system, highly qualified black and Spanish citizens and women who in the past had been excluded. I noticed that Governor Reagan said that when he was a young man that there was no knowledge of a racial problem in this country. Those who suffered from discrimination because of race or sex certainly knew we had a racial problem. We have gone a long way toward correcting these problems, but we still have a long way to go."}

He has never supported any of those arms control agreements \u2013 the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford \u2013 and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a seven-year period, by myself and my two Republican predecessors.

So, it is good fo the American people to remember that there is a sharp basic historical difference between Governor Reagan and me on these crucial issues \u2013 also, between the two parties that we represent."}

First of all, there is the historical perspective that I just described. This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I have taken in the Oval Office the last four years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others. The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who don\u2019t presently have it, particularly terrorist nations. The inclination that Governor Reagan has exemplified in many troubled times since he has been running for President \u2013 I think since 1968 \u2013 to inject American military forces in places like North Korea, to put a blockade around Cuba this year, or in some instances, to project American forces into a fishing dispute against the small nation of Ecuador on the west coast of South America. This is typical of his long-standing inclination, on the use of American power, not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully, but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it. Obviously, no President wants war, and I certainly do not believe that Governor Reagan, if he were President, would want war, but a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace, through diplomacy, or in a careless way in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past."}

I happen to believe that the Federal Government has usurped powers of autonomy and authority that belong back at the state and local level. It has imposed on the individual freedoms of the people, and there are more of these things that could be solved by the people themselves, if they were given a chance, or by the levels of government that were closer to them. Now, as to why I should be and he shouldn\u2019t be, when he was a candidate in 1976, President Carter invented a thing he called the misery index. He added the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation, and it came, at that time, to 12.5% under President Ford. He said that no man with that size misery index has a right to seek reelection to the Presidency. Today, by his own decision, the misery index is in excess of 20%, and I think this must suggest something. But, when I had quoted a Democratic President, as the President says, I was a Democrat. I said many foolish things back in those days. But the President that I quoted had made a promise, a Democratic promise, and I quoted him because it was never kept. And today, you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today. That\u2019s why I believe there are going to be millions of Democrats that are going to vote with us this time around, because they too want that promise kept. It was a promise for less government and less taxes and more freedom for the people."}

For 40 years, the Republican Party platforms called for guaranteeing women equal rights with a constitutional amendment. Six predecessors of mine who served in the Oval Office called for this guarantee of women\u2019s rights. Governor Reagan and his new Republican Party have departed from this commitment \u2013 a very severe blow to the opportunity for women to finally correct discrimination under which they have suffered. When a man and a women do the same amount of work, a man gets paid $1.00, a women only gets paid 59 cents. And the equal rights amendment only says that equality of rights shall not be abridged for omen b the Federal Government or by he state governments.

I think it\u2019s been a very constructive debate and I hope it\u2019s helped to acquaint the American people with the sharp differences between myself and Governor Reagan. Also, I want to thank the people of Cleveland and Ohio for being such hospitable hosts during these last few hours in my life. I\u2019ve been President now for almost four years. I\u2019ve had to make thousands of decisions, and each one of those decisions has been a learning process. I\u2019ve seen the strength of my nation, and I\u2019ve seen the crises it approached in a tentative way. And I\u2019ve had to deal with those crises as best I could. As I\u2019ve studied the record between myself and Governor Reagan, I\u2019ve been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us. I think the result of this debate indicates that that fact is true. I consider myself in the mainstream of my party. I consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of Presidents who served before me. The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure. We must have a society that\u2019s just and fair. And we must extend the benefits of our own commitment to peace, to create a peaceful world. I believe that since I\u2019ve been in office, there have been six or eight areas of combat evolved in other parts of the world. In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country. I\u2019ve done that with moderation, with care, with thoughtfulness; sometimes consulting experts. But, I\u2019ve learned in this last three and a half years that when an issue is extremely difficult, when the call is very close, the chances are the experts will be divided almost 50-50. And the final judgment about the future of the nation \u2013 war, peace, involvement, reticence, thoughtfulness, care, consideration, concern \u2013 has to be made by the man in the Oval Office. It\u2019s a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people in the process, with an open Government, the job is a very gratifying one. The American people now are facing, next Tuesday, a lonely decision. Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country. And I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference. If one vote per precinct had changed in 1960, John Kennedy would never have been President of this nation. And if a few more people had gone to the polls and voted in 1968, Hubert Humphrey would have been President; Richard Nixon would not. There is a partnership involved in our nation. To stay strong, to stay at peace, to raise high the banner of human rights, to set an example for the rest of the world, to let our deep beliefs and commitments be felt by others in other nations, is my plan for the future. I ask the American people to join me in this partnership."}

I\u2019m sorry that we couldn\u2019t persuade the bringing in of the third candidate, so that he could have been seen also in these debates. But still, it\u2019s good that at least once, all three of us were heard by the people of this country. Next Tuesday is Election Day. Next Tuesday all of you will go to the polls, will stand there in the polling place and make a decision. I think when you make that decision, it might be well if you would ask yourself, are you better off than you were four years ago? Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago? Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago? Is America as respected throughout the world as it was? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we\u2019re as strong as we were four years ago? And if you answer all of those questions yes, why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for. If you don\u2019t agree, if you don\u2019t think that this course that we\u2019ve been on for the last four years is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have. This country doesn\u2019t have to be in the shape that it is in. We do not have to go on sharing in scarcity with the country getting worse off, with unemployment growing. We talk about the unemployment lines. If all of the unemployed today were in a single line allowing two feet for each of them, that line would reach from New York City to Los Angeles, California. All of this can be cured and all of it can be solved. I have not had the experience the President has had in holding that office, but I think in being Governor of California, the most populous state in the Union \u2013 if it were a nation, it would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world \u2013 I, too, had some lonely moments and decisions to make. I know that the economic program that I have proposed for this nation in the next few years can resolve many of the problems that trouble us today. I know because we did it there. We cut the cost \u2013 the increased cost of government \u2013 in half over the eight years. We returned $5.7 billion in tax rebates, credits and cuts to our people. We, as I have said earlier, fell below the national average in inflation when we did that. And I know that we did give back authority and autonomy to the people. I would like to have a crusade today, and I would like to lead that crusade with your help. And it would be one to take Government off the backs of the great people of this country, and turn you loose again to do those things that I know you can do so well, because you did them and made this country great. Thank you."}

CARTER","Party":"Democratic","Factor 1":53,"Factor 2":21,"Factor 3":-3,"Factor 4":0,"Factor 5":3,"Factor 6":3,"Text":"Yes. First of all is to recognize a tremendous economic strength in this country and to set the putting to \u2013 back to work of our people as a top priority. This is uh \u2013 an effort that ought to be done primarily by strong leadership in the White House, the inspiration of our people, the tapping of uh \u2013 business, agriculture, industry, labor and government at all levels to work on this uh project. We\u2019ll never have uh \u2013 an end to the inflationary spiral, and we\u2019ll never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work. There are several things that can be done specifically that are not now being done. First of all, to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide uh large numbers of jobs. Secondly, we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh \u2013 to cooperate with government in matters like housing. Here a very small investment of taxpayer\u2019s money \u2013 in the housing field can bring large numbers of extra jobs, and the guarantee of mortgage loans, and the uh \u2013 putting forward of uh \u2013 two-0-two programs for housing for older people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exists in the \u2013 in the construction industry. Another thing is to deal with our \u2013 uh needs in the central cities, where the unemployment rate is extremely high: sometimes among minority groups, or those who don\u2019t speak English, or who\u2019re black, or young people, or \u2013 40 percent of the employment. Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah \u2013 cha- in \u2013 in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work. Another very important \u2013 uh aspect of our \u2013 uh economy would be to increase production in every way possible, uh to hold down \u2013 uh taxes on individuals, and to uh shift the tax burdens onto those who have avoided paying taxes in the past. These uh \u2013 kinds of specific things, uh none of which are being done now, would be a great help in \u2013 in reducing uh unemployment. There is uh \u2013 uh an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very \u2013 very succinctly, and that is, to make sure that we have a good relationship between management \u2013 business on the one hand, and labor, on the other. In a > Transfer interrupted! ery high, we might channel specific uh targeted job \u2013 job \u2013 uh opportunities by paying part of the salary of unemployed people \u2013 uh and also sharing with uh \u2013 local governments the uh \u2013 payment of salaries which would uh \u2013 let us cut down the unemployment rate much lower, before we hit the inflationary level. But I believe that by the end of the first four years of uh \u2013 of the next term we could have the unemployment down to 3 percent adult unemployment, which is about uh \u2013 4 to 4 and a half percent overall uh controlled inflation rate and have a uh balance of growth of about \u2013 uh 4 to 6 percent, around 5 percent which would give us a balanced budget."}

That legislation uh allegedly would help our unemployment, but uh \u2013 we all know that it would\u2019ve controlled our economy, it would\u2019ve added uh \u2013 ten to thirty billion dollars each year in additional expenditures by the Federal Government. It would\u2019ve called for export controls on agricultural products In my judgment the best way to get jobs is to uh \u2013 expand the private sector, where five out of six jobs today exist in our economy. We can do that by reducing Federal taxes as I proposed uh \u2013 about a year ago when I called for a tax reduction of $28 billion \u2013 three-quarters of it to go to private uh taxpayers and uh one-quarter to the business sector. We could add to jobs in the major metropolitan areas by a proposal that I recommended that would give tax incentives to business to move into the inner city and to expand or to build new plants so that they would take a plant, or expand a plant where people are, and people are currently unemployed. We could uh \u2013 also uh \u2013 help our youths with some of the proposals that uh \u2013 would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time just like we give money to young people who are going to college. Those are the kind of specifics that I think we have to discuss on these uh \u2013 debates, and these are the kind of programs that I\u2019ll talk about on my time."}

I said at the time that we had to hold the lid an federal spending, that for every dollar of a tax reduction we had to have an equal reduction in federal expenditures \u2013 a one-for-one proposition. And I recommended that to the Congress with a budget ceiling of three hundred and ninety-five billion dollars, and that would have permitted us to have a $25 billion tax reduction. In my tax reduction program for middle-income taxpayers, I recommended that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person. That would mean, of course, that for a family of four that that family would have a thousand dollars more personal exemption \u2013 money that they could spend for their own purposes, money that the government wouldn\u2019t have to spend. But if we keep the lid on federal spending, which I think we can \u2013 with the help of the Congress, we can justify fully a $28 billion tax reduction. In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending. For the last ten years the budget of the United States has grown from uh \u2013 about 11 percent per year. We can\u2019t afford that kind of growth in federal spending. And in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half \u2013 a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one-half percent. With that kind of limitation, on federal spending, we can fully justify the tax reductions that I have proposed. And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that we\u2019ll get more revenue and we\u2019ll have a more prosperous economy."}

I\u2019m sure that you know that in the resolutions passed by the Congress, that have added about $17 billion in more spending, by the Congress over the budget that I recommended. So I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending. Now this tax bill \u2013 that hasn\u2019t reached the White House yet, but is expected in a day or two \u2013 it\u2019s about fifteen hundred pages. It has some good provisions in it.

When Mr. Ford first became president in \u2013 in August of 1974, the first thing he did in \u2013 in October was to ask for a $4.7 billion increase in taxes on our people in the midst of the heaviest recession, since uh \u2013 since the great depression of nineteen uh \u2013 of the 1940s.

In uh \u2013 December of uh \u2013 1975 he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion dollar uh tax-reduction bill that had been passed by the Congress, and then he came back later on in January of this year and he did advocate a $10 billion tax reduction, but it would be offset by a $6 billion increase this coming January in deductions for Social Security payments and for unemployment compensation. The whole philosophy of the Republican party, including uh \u2013 my opponent, has been to pile on taxes on low-income people to take \u2019em off on the corporations.

And I believe that by eliminating ten million taxpayers in the last uh eight years, and by putting a heavier tax burden on those in the higher tax brackets, plus the other actions that\u2019ve been taken uh \u2013 we can give taxpayers adequate tax relief. Now it seems to me that uh \u2013 as we look at the recommendations of the budget committees and our own projections, there isn\u2019t going to be any $60 billion dividend. I\u2019ve heard of those dividends in the past; it always happens. We expected one at the time of the Vietnam War, but it was used up before we ever ended the war and taxpayers never got the adequate relief they deserved."}

When I took aver we had uh a bureaucratic mess, like we have in Washington now, and we had three hundred agencies, departments, bureaus, commissions \u2013 uh some uh \u2013 fully budgeted, some not, but all having responsibility to carry out that was in conflict. And we cut those three hundred \u2013 uh agencies and so forth down substantially. We eliminated two hundred and seventy-eight of them. We set up a simple structure of government that could be administrated fairly and it was a \u2013 a tremendous success. It hasn\u2019t been undone since I was there. It resulted also in an ability to reshape our court system, our prison system, our education system, our mental health programs and \u2013 and a clear assignment of responsibility and \u2013 and authority and also to have uh our people once again understanding control our government. I intend to do the same thing if I\u2019m elected president. When I get to Washington, coming in as an outsider, one of the major responsibilities that \u2013 that I will have on my shoulder is a complete reorganization of the \u2013 of the executive branch of government. We now have uh \u2013 a greatly expanded White House staff. When Mr. Nixon went in office, for instance, we had three and a half million dollars spent on \u2013 on the White House and its staff. That has escalated now to sixteen and a half million dollars, in the last uh Republican administration. This needs to be changed. We need to put the responsibilities back on the cabinet members. We also need to have a great reduction in agencies and programs. For instance, we now have uh \u2013 in the health area three hundred and two different programs administered by eleven major departments and agencies, sixty other advisory commissions responsible for this. Medicaid\u2019s in one agency; Medicare is in a different one. The \u2013 the check on the quality of health care is in a different one. None of them uh are responsible for health care itself. This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program. We have uh \u2013 just advocated uh \u2013 this past week a consolidation of the responsibilities for energy. Our country now has no comprehensive energy program or policy. We have twenty different agencies in the federal government responsible for the production, the regulation, the uh \u2013 information about energy, the conservation of energy, spread all over government. This is a \u2013 a gross waste of money, so tough, competent management of government, giving us a simple efficient purposeful and manageable government would be a great step forward and if I\u2019m elected \u2013 and I intend to be \u2013 then it\u2019s gonna be done."}

He testified, and these are his words \u2013 the present governor of Georgia \u2013 he says he found the Medicaid program in Georgia in shambles. Now let me talk about what we\u2019ve done in the White House as far as federal employees are concerned The first order that I issued after I became president was to cut or eliminate the prospective forty-thousand increase in federal employees that had been scheduled by my predecessor. And in the term that I\u2019ve been president \u2013 some two years \u2013 we have reduced federal employment by eleven thousand. In the White House staff itself, when I became president, we had roughly five hundred and forty employees. We now have about four hundred and eighty-five employees, so we\u2019ve made a rather significant reduction in the number of employees on the White House staff working for the president. So I think our record of cutting back employees, plus the failure on the part of the Governor\u2019s programs to actually save employment in Georgia, shows which is the better plan."}

The net result is we are going to have some improvement in our receipts. And I think we\u2019ll have some decrease in our disbursements. We expect to have a lower deficit in fiscal year 1978. We feel that with this improvement in the economy; we feel with more receipts and fewer disbursements we can in a moderate way increase, as I recommended, over the next ten years a new parks program that would cast a billion and a half dollars, doubling our national park system. We have recommended that in the h- housing program we can reduce down payments and moderate monthly payments. But that doesn\u2019t cost any more as far as the federal treasury is concerned. We believe that we can uh do a better job in the area of crime, but that requires a tougher sentencing, mandatory certain prison sentences for those who violate our criminal laws. We \u2013 uh believe that uh you can revise the federal criminal code, which has not been revised in a good many years. That doesn\u2019t cost any more money.

We won\u2019t wait one year or two years longer, as Governor Carter uh \u2013 indicates.

I think I know the \u2013 the uh capabilities and limitations of atomic power. But the energy \u2013 uh policy of our nation is one that uh has not yet been established under this administration. I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy except us. We have seen uh \u2013 the Federal Energy Agency established, for instance. Uh \u2013 in the crisis of 1973 it was supposed to be a temporary agency, uh now it\u2019s permanent, it\u2019s enormous, it\u2019s growing every day. I think the Wall Street Journal uh reported not too long ago they have a hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people its own existence. We\u2019ve got to have a \u2013 a firm way to handle the energy question. The reorganization proposal that I have put forward is one uh first step. In addition to that, we need to have \u2013 uh a realization that we\u2019ve got uh about thirty-five years worth of oil left in the whole world. We\u2019re gonna run out of oil. When Mr. Nixon made his famous uh speech on Operation Independence we were importing about 35 percent of our oil. Now we\u2019ve increased that amount 25 percent. We now import about 44 percent of our oil. We need to shift from oil to coal. We need to concentrate our research and development effort on uh coal burning and extraction, with safer mines, but also it\u2019s clean burning. We need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures. And then as a last resort only, continue to use atomic power. I would certainly uh \u2013 not cut out atomic power altogether. We can\u2019t afford to give up that opportunity until later. But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained. For instance, some that have been forgotten; we need to have the reactor core \u2013 below ground level, the entire power plant that uses atomic uh \u2013 power tightly sealed and a heavy \u2013 heavy vacuum maintained. There ought to be a standardized design. There ought to be a full-time uh \u2013 atomic energy specialist, independent of the power company in the control room, full time, twenty-four hours a day, to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops. These kinds of uh \u2013 procedures, along with evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated. So, shift from oil to coal, emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power, strict conservation measures, not yield every time that the special interest groups uh \u2013 put pressure on the president like uh this administration has done, and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strictest possible safety precautions. That\u2019s the best overall energy policy in the brief time we have to discuss it."}

I recommended to the Congress that we should increase production in this country from six hundred million tons a year to twel- a- a billion two hundred million tons by 1985. In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground; we have to improve our utilization of coal \u2013 make it more efficient, make it cleaner. In addition we uh \u2013 have to expand our research and development. In my program for energy independence we have increased, for example, solar energy research from about $84 million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year. We\u2019re going as fast as the experts say we should.

Now if you uh \u2013 take the medium or middle-income taxpayer \u2013 that\u2019s about $14 thousand per person \u2013 uh \u2013 Governor Carter has indicated, publicly, in an interview that he would increase the taxes on about 50 percent of the working people of this country.

I believe in tax equity for the middle-income taxpayer, increasing the personal exemption. Mr. Carter wants to increase taxes for roughly half of the taxpayers of this country. Now, the Governor has also played a little fast and loose with the facts about vetoes. The records show that President Roosevelt vetoed an average of fifty-five bills a year. President Truman vetoed on the average, while he was president, about thirty-eight bills a year.

Uhh \u2013 I have recommended to the Congress, however \u2013 I\u2019m sure you\u2019re familiar with this \u2013 legislation that would uhh \u2013 make it uhh \u2013 very uhh \u2013 proper in \u2013 in the right way, that the attorney general could go in and get the right for wiretapping under security cases. This was an effort that was made by the attorney general and myself, working with the Congress. But even in this area, where I think new legislation would be justified, uh the Congress has not responded. So, I feel in that case, as well as in the reorganization of the intelligence agencies, as I\u2019ve done, we have to do it by executive order. And I\u2019m glad that we have a good director in George Bush. We have good executive orders, and the CIA and the DIA and NASA uh \u2013 uh \u2013 NSA are now doing a good job under proper supervision."}

But I think it\u2019s time to talk about the future. Our nation in the last eight years has been divided as never before. It\u2019s a time for unity. It\u2019s a time to draw ourselves together: to have a president and a Congress that can work together with mutual respect for a change, cooperating for a change, in the open for a change, so the people can understand their own government. It\u2019s time for government, industry, labor, manufacturing, agriculture, education, other entities in our society to cooperate. And it\u2019s a time for government to understand and to cooperate with our people. For a long time our American citizens have been excluded, sometimes misled, sometimes have been lied to. This is uh \u2013 not compatible with the purpose of our nation. I believe in our country. It needs to be competent. The government needs to be well-managed, efficient, economical, We need to have a government that\u2019s sensitive to our people\u2019s needs \u2013 to those who are poor, who don\u2019t have adequate health care, who have been cheated too long with our tax programs, who\u2019ve been out of jobs, whose families have been torn apart. We need to restore the faith and the trust of the American people in their own government. In addition to that, we\u2019ve suffered because we haven\u2019t had leadership in this administration. We\u2019ve got a government of stalemate. We\u2019ve lost the vision of what our country can and ought to be. This is not the America that we\u2019ve known in the past. It\u2019s not the America that we have to have in the future. I don\u2019t claim to know all the answers. But I\u2019ve got confidence in my country. Our economic strength is still there. Our system of government \u2013 in spite of Vietnam, Cambodia, CIA, Watergate \u2013 is still the best system of government on earth. And the greatest resource of all are the two hundred and fifteen million Americans who have within us the strength, the character, the intelligence, the experience, the patriotism, the idealism, the compassion, the sense of brotherhood on which we can rely in the future to restore the greatness to our country We ought not to be excluded from our government anymore. We need a president who can go in \u2013 who derives his strength from the people. I owe the special interests nothing. I owe everything to you, the people of this country. And I believe that we can bind our wounds. I believe that we can work together. And I believe that if we can tap the tremendous untapped reservoir of innate strength in this country, that we can once again have a government as good as our people, and let the world know what we still know and hope for \u2013 that we still live in the greatest and the strongest and the best country on earth."}

One of the major issues in this campaign is trust. A president should never promise more than he can deliver and a president should always deliver everything that he\u2019s promised. A president can\u2019t be all things to all people. A president should be the same thing to all people. Another issue in this campaign, Governor Carter has endorsed the Democratic platform, which calls for more spending, bigger deficits, more inflation or mare taxes. Governor Carter has embraced the record of the present Congress, dominated by his political party. It calls for more of the same. Governor Carter in his acceptance speech called for more and more programs, which means more and more government. I think the real issue in this campaign, and that which you must decide on November second, is whether you should vote for his promise or my performance in two years in the White House. On the fourth of July we had a wonderful two hundredth birthday \u2013 for our great country. It was a superb occasion. It was a glorious day. In the first century of our nation\u2019s history our forefathers gave us the finest form of government in the history of mankind. In the second century of our nation\u2019s history, our forefathers developed the most productive industrial nation in the history of the globe. Our third century should be the century of individual freedom for all our two hundred and fifteen million Americans today and all that join us. In the last few years government has gotten bigger and bigger; industry has gotten larger and larger; labor unions have gotten bigger and bigger; and our children have been the victims of mass education. We must make this next century the century of the individual. We should never forget that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have. The individual worker in the plants throughout the United States should not be a small cog in a big machine. The member of a labor union must have his rights strengthened and broadened and our children in their education should have an opportunity to improve themselves based on their talents and their abilities. My mother and father, during the Depression, worked very hard to give me an opportunity to do better in our great country. Your mothers and fathers did the same thing for you and others. Betty and I have worked very hard to give our children a brighter future in the United States, our beloved country. You and others in this great country have worked hard and done a great deal to give your children and your grandchildren the blessings of a better America. I believe we can all work together to make the individuals in the future have more and all of us working together can build a better America."}

I don\u2019t uh \u2013 look at the picture as bleakly as you have indicated in your question, Mr. Trewhitt. I believe that the United States ha- had many successes in recent years, in recent months, as far as the Communist movement is concerned. We have been successful in Portugal, where a year ago it looked like there was a very great possibility that the uh \u2013 Communists would take over in Portugal. It didn\u2019t happen. We have a democracy in Portugal today. A few uh \u2013 months ago, or I should say, maybe two years ago, the Soviet Union looked like they had continued strength in the Middle East. Today, according to Prime Minister Rabin, the Soviet Union is weaker in the Middle East than they have been in many, many years. The facts are, there \u2013 the Soviet Union relationship with Egypt is uh \u2013 at a low level. The Soviet Union relationship with Syria is at a very low point. The United States today, according to Prime Minister Rabin of Israel, is a- at a peak in its uh \u2013 influence and power in the Middle East. But let\u2019s turn for a minute to the uhh \u2013 southern African operations that are now going on. The United States of America took the initiative in southern Africa. We wanted to end the bloodshed in southern Africa. We wanted to have the right of self-determination in southern Africa. We wanted to have majority rule with the full protection of the rights of the minority. We wanted to preserve human dignity in southern Africa. We have taken the initiative, and in southern Africa today the United States is trusted by the black front-line nations and black Africa. The United States is trusted by other elements in southern Africa. The United States foreign policy under this administration has been one of progress and success. And I believe that instead of talking about Soviet progress, we can talk about American successes. And may I make an observation \u2013 part of the question you asked, Mr. Trewhitt? I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s in the best interest of the United States and the NATO nations to have a Communist government in NATO. Mr. Carter has indicated he would look with sympathy to a Communist government in NATO. I think that would destroy the integrity and the strength of NATO, and I am totally opposed to it."}

As a matter of fact, uh \u2013 I\u2019ve never advocated any cut of $15 billion in our defense budget. As a matter of fact, Mr. Ford has made a political football out of the defense budget. About a year ago he cut the Pentagon budget six point eight billion dollars. After he fired James Schlesinger, the political heat got so great that he added back about $3 billion. When Ronald Reagan won the Texas primary election, Mr. Ford added back another one and a half billion dollars. Immediately before the Kansas City convention, he added back another one point eight billion dollars in the defense budget. And his own uh \u2013 Office of Management and Budget testified that he had a $3 billion cut insurance added to the defense budget \u2013 defense budget under the pressure from the Pentagon. Obviously, this is another indication of trying to use the defense budget for political purposes, which he\u2019s trying to do tonight. Now, we went into south Africa late, after Great Britain, Rhodesia, the black nations had been trying to solve this problem for many, many years. We didn\u2019t go in until right before the election, similar to what was taking place in 1972, when Mr. Kissinger announced peace is at hand just before the election at that time. And we have weakened our position in NATO because the other countries in Europe supported the democ- democratic forces in Portugal long before we did; we stuck to the Portugal dictatorships much longer than other democracies did in this world."}

I am a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, the first military graduate since uh \u2013 Eisenhower. I\u2019ve served as the Governor of Georgia and have traveled extensively in foreign countries and South America, Central America, Europe, the Middle East and in Japan. I\u2019ve traveled the last twenty-one months among the people of this country. I\u2019ve talked to them and I\u2019ve listened. And I\u2019ve seen at first hand, in a very vivid way, the deep hurt that\u2019s come to this country in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia, Chile, and Pakistan, and Angola, and Watergate, CIA revelations. What we were formerly so proud of \u2013 the strength of our country, its uh \u2013 moral integrity, the representation in foreign affairs of what our people are, what our Constitution stands for, has been gone. And in the secrecy that has surrounded our foreign policy in the last few years, uh \u2013 the American people, the Congress have been excluded. I believe I know what this country ought to be. I\u2019ve uh \u2013 been one who\u2019s loved my nation as many Americans do, and I believe that there\u2019s no limit placed on what we can be in the future, if we can harness the tremendous resources \u2013 militarily, economically, and the stature of our people, the meaning of the Constitution, in the future. Every time we\u2019ve made a serious mistake in foreign affairs, it\u2019s been because the American people have been excluded from the process. If we can just tap the intelligence and ability, the sound common sense and the good judgment of the American people, we can once again have a foreign policy to make us proud instead of ashamed. And I\u2019m not gonna exclude the American people from that process in the future, as Mr. Ford and Kissinger have done. This is what it takes to have a sound foreign policy strong at home, strong defense, permanent commitments, not betray the principles of our country, and involve the American people and the Congress in the shaping of our foreign policy. Every time Mr. Ford speaks from a position of secrecy in negotiations, in secret \u2013 in secret treaties that\u2019ve been uh \u2013 pursued and achieved, in supporting dictatorships, in ignoring human rights, we are weak and the rest of the world knows it. So these are the ways that we can restore the strength of our country, and they don\u2019t require long experience in foreign policy. Nobody has that except a president who has served a long time or a secretary of state. But my background, my experience, my knowledge of the people of this country, my commitment to our principles that don\u2019t change \u2013 those are the best bases to correct the horrible mistakes of this administration and restore our own country to a position of leadership in the world."}

If I ever decided to impose an embargo because of a crisis in international relationships, it would include all shipments of all equipment. For instance, if the Arab countries ever again declare an embargo against our nation on oil I would consider that not a military but an economic declaration of war, and I would respond instantly and in kind. I would not ship that Arab country anything \u2013 no weapons, no spare parts for weapons, no oil-drilling rigs, no oil pipe, no nothing. I wouldn\u2019t single out just food. Another thing that I\u2019d like to say is this: In our international trade, as I said in my op- opening statement, we have become the arms merchant of the world. When this Republican administration came into office we were shipping about $1 billion worth of arms overseas, now ten to twelve billion dollars worth of arms overseas to countries that quite often use these weapons to fight each other. The shift in emphasis has been very disturbing to me, speaking about the Middle East. Under the last Democratic administration 60 percent of all weapons that went into the Middle East were for Israel. Nowadays \u2013 75 percent were for Israel before. Now 60 percent go to the Arab countries, and this does not include Iran. If you include Iran, our present shipment of weapons to the Middle East, only 20 percent goes to Israel. This is a deviation from idealism; it\u2019s a deviation from a commitment to our major ally in the Middle East, which is Israel; it\u2019s a yielding to economic pressure on the part of the Arabs on the oil issue; and it\u2019s also a tremendous indication that under the Ford administration we have not addressed the energy policy adequately. We still have no comprehensive energy policy in this country. And it\u2019s an overall sign of weakness. When we are weak at home economically \u2013 high unemployment, high inflation, a confused government, a wasteful defense establishment, this encourages the kind of pressure that\u2019s been put on us successfully. It would\u2019ve been inconceivable ten \u2013 fifteen years ago, for us to be brought to our knees with an Arab oil embargo. But it was done three years ago and they\u2019re still putting pressure on us from the Arab countries to our discredit around the world. These are the weaknesses that I see, and I believe it\u2019s not just a matter of idealism. It\u2019s a matter of being tough. It\u2019s a matter of being strong. It\u2019s a matter of being consistent. Our priorities ought to be first of all to meet our own military needs, secondly to meet the needs of our allies and friends, and only then should we ship military equipment to foreign countries. As a matter of fact, Iran is gonna get eighty F-14s before we even meet our own Air Force orders for F-l4s. And the shipment of Spruance-class destroyers to Iran are much more highly sophisticated than the Spruance-class destroyers that are present being delivered to our own Navy. This is ridiculous and it ought to be changed."}

Reductions of that kind will not permit the United States to be strong enough to deter aggression and maintain the peace. Governor Carter apparently doesn\u2019t know the facts. As soon as I became president, I initiated a meeting with the NATO heads of state and met with them in Brussels to discuss how we could improve the re- defense relationship in Western Europe.

Uh \u2013 Mr. Brezhnev and I met in Vladivostok in December of 1974 for the purpose of trying to take the initial step so we could have a SALT II agreement that would go to l985. As I indicated earlier, we did agree on a twenty-four-hundred limitation on uh \u2013 uh \u2013 launchers of ballistic missiles. Uh \u2013 that would mean a cutback in the Soviet program; it would not interfere with our own program. At the same time, we put a limitation of thirteen hundred and twenty on MIRVs. Our technicians have been working since that time in Geneva, trying to put into technical language a \u2013 an agreement that can be verified by both parties. In the meantime, there has developed the problem of the Soviet Backfire \u2013 their high-performance aircraft which they say is not a long-range aircraft and which some of our people say is a intercontinental aircraft. In the interim, there has been the development on our part primarily, the cruise missiles; cruise missiles that could be launched from land-based mobile installations; cruise missiles that could be launched \u2013 launched from high-performance aircraft, like the B-52s or the B-1s, which I hope we proceed with; cruise missiles which could be launched from either surface or submarine uh \u2013 naval vessels. Those gray-area weapons systems are creating some problems in a \u2013 the agreement for a SALT II negotiation. But I can say that I am dedicated to proceeding, and I met just last week with the foreign minister of the Soviet Union, and he indicated to me that uh \u2013 the Soviet Union was interested in narrowing the differences and making a realistic and a sound compromise. I hope and trust, in the best interest of both countries, and in the best interests of all people throughout this globe, that the Soviet Union and the United States can make a mutually beneficial agreement. Because if we do not and SALT I expires on October three, 1977, you will unleash again an all-out nuclear arms race with the potential of a nuclear holocaust of unbelievable dimensions. So it\u2019s the obligation of the president to do just that, and I intend to do so."}

I also \u2013 know that as far as the human beings on this earth are concerned that the nonproliferation of atomic weapons is number one. Only the last few days with the election approaching, has Mr. Ford taken any interest in a nonproliferation movement. I advocated last May in a speech at the United Nations that we move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear devices, both weapons and peaceful devices; that we not ship any more atomic fuel to a country that refuses to comply with strict controls over the waste which can be reprocessed into explosives. I\u2019ve also advocated that we stop the sale by Germany and France of \u2013 processing plants for Pakistan and Brazil. Mr. Ford hasn\u2019t moved on this. We also need to provide an adequate supply of enriched uranium. Mr. Ford, again, under pressure from the atomic energy lobby, has insisted that this reprocessing or rather re-en- enrichment be done by private industry and not by the existing uh \u2013 government uh \u2013 plants. This kind of confusion and absence of leadership has let us drift now for two years with a constantly increasing threat of atomic weapons throughout the world. We now have five nations that have atomic bombs that we know about. If we continue under Mr. Ford\u2019s policy by 1985 or \u201990 we\u2019ll have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons. This has got to be stopped.

What is more moral in foreign policy than for the administration to take the lead in the World Food Conference in Rome in 1974 when the United States committed six million metric tons of food \u2013 over 60 percent of the food committed for the disadvantaged and underdeveloped nations of the world? The Ford administration wants to eradicate hunger and disease in our underdeveloped countries throughout the world. What is more moral than for the United States under the Ford administration to take the lead in southern Africa, in the Middle East? Those are initiatives in foreign policy which are of the highest moral standard and that is indicative of the foreign policy of this country."}

And the initiatives that we took in southern Africa are the best examples of what this administration is doing and will continue to do in the next four years. If the United States had not moved when we did in southern Africa, there\u2019s no doubt there would have been an acceleration of bloodshed in that tragic part of the world. If we had not taken our initiative, it\u2019s very, very possible that uh \u2013 the government of Rhodesia would have been overrun and that the Soviet Union and the Cubans would have dominated uh \u2013 southern Africa. So the United States, seeking to preserve the principle of self-determination, to eliminate the possibility of bloodshed, to protect the rights of the minority as we insisted upon the rights of the majority, uh \u2013 I believe followed the good conscience of the American people in foreign policy. And I believe that we used our skill. Secretary of State Kissinger has done a superb job in working with the black African nations, the so-called front-line nations. He has done a superb job in getting the prime minister of South Africa, Mr. Vorster, to agree that the time had come for a solution to the problem of Rhodesia. Secretary Kissinger, in his meeting with uh \u2013 Prime Minister Smith of Rhodesia, was able to convince him that it was in the best interests of whites as well as blacks in Rhodesia to find an answer for a transitional government and then a majority government. This is a perfect example of the kind of leadership that the United States, under this administration, has taken. And I can assure you that this administration will follow that high moral principle in our future efforts in foreign policy, including our efforts in the Middle East where it is vitally important because the Middle East is the crossroads of the world. There\u2019ve been more disputes in its area where there\u2019s more volatility than any other place in the world. But because Arab nations and the Israelis trust the United States, we were able to take the lead in the Sinai II Agreement. And I can assure you that the United States will have the leadership role in moving toward a comprehensive settlement of the Middle Eastern problems, I hope and trust as soon as possible. And we will do it with the highest moral principles."}

Let me take uh \u2013 South Korea as an example. I have personally told President Pack that the United States does not condone the kind of repressive measures that he has taken in that country.

On the north they have North Korea with five hundred thousand well-trained, well-equipped troops \u2013 they are supported by the People\u2019s Republic of China; they are supported by the Soviet Union.

We ought to be a beacon for nations who search for peace and who search for freedom, who search for individual liberty, who search for basic human rights. We haven\u2019t been lately. We can be once again. We\u2019ll never have that world leadership until we are strong at home, and we can have that strength if we return to the basic principles.

I don\u2019t think that uh \u2013 America can go on a big spending spree with a whole lot of new programs uh \u2013 that would add significantly to the federal budget. I believe that the American people, if given the leadership that I would expect to give, would be willing to give this thrust to preserve the peace and the necessary restraint at home to hold the lid on spending so that we could, I think, have a long overdue and totally justified tax decrease for the middle-income people.

Mr. Ford\u2019s own uh \u2013 environmental agency has projected a 10 percent unemployment rate by 1978 if he\u2019s uh \u2013 president. The American people are ready to make sacrifices if they are part of the process. If they know that they will be helping to make decisions and won\u2019t be excluded from being an involved party to the national purpose. The major effort we must put forward is to put our people back to work. And I think that this uh \u2013 is one example where uh \u2013 a lot of people have selfish, grasping ideas now. I remember 1973 in the depth of the uh \u2013 energy crisis when President Nixon called on the American people to make a sacrifice, to cut down on the waste of uh \u2013 gasoline, to cut down on the uh \u2013 speed of automobiles. It was a \u2013 a tremendous surge of patriotism, that \u201cI want to make a sacrifice for my country.\u201d I think we uh \u2013 could call together, with strong leadership in the White House, business, industry and labor, and say let\u2019s have voluntary price restraints. Let\u2019s lay down some guidelines so we don\u2019t have continuing inflation. We can also have a- an end to the extremes. We now have one extreme for instance, of some welfare recipients, who by taking advantage of the welfare laws, the housing laws, the uh \u2013 Medicaid uh \u2013 laws, and the uh \u2013 food stamp laws, make over $10 thousand a year and uh \u2013 they don\u2019t have to pay any taxes on it. At the other extreme, uh \u2013 just 1 percent of the richest people in our country derive 25 percent of all the tax benefits. So both those extremes grasp for advantage and the person who has to pay that expense is the middle-income family who\u2019s still working for a living and they have to pay for the rich who have privilege, and for the poor who are not working. But I think uh \u2013 uh \u2013 a balanced approach, with everybody being part of it and a striving for unselfishness, could help as it did in 1973 to let people sacrifice for their own country. I know I\u2019m ready for it. I think the American people are too."}

I believe that the opposite is true with President Ford\u2019s campaign, and uh \u2013 I hope that we can leave those issues in this next ten days about personalities and mistakes of the past \u2013 we\u2019ve both made some mistakes \u2013 and talk about unemployment, inflation, housing, education, taxation, government organization, stripping away of secrecy, and the things that are crucial to the American people.

I indicated under oath that the initiative that I took was at the request of the ranking members of the House Banking and Currency Committee on the Republican side, which was a legitimate request and a proper response by me. Now that was gone into by two congressional committees, and following that investigation, both committees overwhelmingly approved me, and the House and the Senate did likewise. Now, in the meantime, the special prosecutor, within the last few days, after an investigation himself, said there was no reason for him to get involved because he found nothing that would justify it. And then just a day or two ago, the attorney general of the United States made a further investigation and came to precisely the same conclusion. Now, after all of those investigations by objective, responsible people, I think the matter is closed once and for all. But to add one other feature, I don\u2019t control any of the tapes.

I came from a tiny town, as you know, Plains, and didn\u2019t hold public office, didn\u2019t have very much money. And my first organization was just four or five people plus my wife and my children, my three sons and their wives. And we won the nomination by going out into the streets \u2013 barbershops, beauty parlors, restaurants, stores, in factory shift lines also in farmers\u2019 markets and livestock sale barns \u2013 and we talked a lot and we listened a lot and we learned from the American people.

Now we have a very, very wide-ranging group of advisers who help me prepare for these debates and who teach me about international economics, and foreign affairs, defense matters, health, education, welfare, government reorganization. I\u2019d say, several hundred of them. And they\u2019re very fine and very highly qualified. The one major decision that I have made since acquiring the nomination, and I share this with President Ford, is the choice of a vice president. I think this should be indicative of the kind of leaders I would choose to help me if I am elected. I chose Senator Walter Mondale. And the only criterion I ever put forward in my own mind was who among the several million people in this country would be the best person qualified to be president, if something should happen to me and to join me in being vice president if I should serve out my term. And I\u2019m convinced now, more than I was when I got the nomination, that Walter Mondale was the right choice, And I believe this is a good indication of the kind of people I would choose in the future. Mr. Ford has had that same choice to make. I don\u2019t want to say anything critical of Senator Dole, but I\u2019ve never heard Mr. Ford say that that was his prim- primary consideration \u2013 Who is the best person I could choose in this country to be president of the United States? I feel completely at ease knowing that someday Senator Mondale might very well be president.

If my recollection is correct he indicated that uh \u2013 General Brown was not qualified to be a sewer commissioner. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a proper way to describe aayuh- chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who has fought for his country for thirty-five years, and I\u2019m sure the governor would agree with me on that. Uh \u2013 I think Senator Dole would show more good judgment and discretion than to so describe uh \u2013 a heroic and brave and very outstanding leader of the military.

Number two, that strip-mining bill would\u2019ve severely set back our need for more coal, and Governor Carter has said repeatedly that coal is the resource that we need to use more in the effort to become independent of the uh \u2013 Arab oil supply.

But let\u2019s talk about what the Ford administration has done in the field of environment. I have increased, as president, by over 60 percent the funding for water treatment plants in the United States, the federal contribution. I have fully funded the land and water conservation program; in fact, have recommended and the Congress approved a substantially increased land and water conservation program. Uh \u2013 I have uh \u2013 added in the current year budget the funds for the National Park Service.

In the first place, uh \u2013 as is the case with the environmental policy and the energy policy that I just described, and the policy for nonproliferation of uh \u2013 of nuclear waste, this administration has no urban policy. It\u2019s impossible for mayors or governors to cooperate with the resident, because they can\u2019t anticipate what\u2019s gonna happen next. A mayor of a city like New York, for instance, needs to know uh \u2013 eighteen months or two years ahead of time what responsibility the city will have in administration and in financing \u2013 in things like housing, uh \u2013 pollution control, uh \u2013 crime control, education, welfare and health. This has not been done, unfortunately. I remember the headline in the Daily News that said, \u201cFord to New York: Drop Dead.\u201d I think it\u2019s very important that our cities know that they have a partner in the federal government. Quite often Congress has passed laws in the past designed to help people with uh \u2013 the ownership of homes and with the control of crime and with adequate health care and education programs and so forth. Uh \u2013 those uh programs were designed to help those who need it most. And quite often this has been in the very poor people and neighborhoods in the downtown urban centers. Because of the uh \u2013 great -ly- greatly uh \u2013 advantaged uh \u2013 tho- per \u2013 persons who live in the suburbs, better education, better organization, more articulate, more aware of what the laws are, quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where it\u2019s needed. Also I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care. We have now uh \u2013 for instance only 7 percent of the total education cost being financed by the federal government. When uh \u2013 the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent. That\u2019s a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contributes to education in just eight years. And as you know, the education cost has gone up uh \u2013 tremendously. The last point is that the major \u2013 uh thrust has gotta be to put people back to work. We\u2019ve got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh \u2013 particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent. And the concentration of employment opportunities in those areas would help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base, but also to help reduce the extraordinary welfare cost. One of the major responsibilities on the shoulders of uh \u2013 New York City is to \u2013 is to finance welfare. And I favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether. And over a longer period of time, let the federal government begin to absorb part of it that\u2019s now paid by the state governments. Those things would help a great deal with the cities, but we still have a \u2013 a very serious problem there."}

In addition we uh \u2013 in the federal government make available to uh \u2013 cities about uh \u2013 three billion three hundred million dollars in what we call community development. In adesh- in addition, uh \u2013 uh \u2013 as a result of my pressure an the Congress, we got a major mass transit program uh \u2013 over a four-year period, eleven billion eight-hundred million dollars. We have a good housing program, uh \u2013 that uh \u2013 will result in cutting uh \u2013 the down payments by 50 percent and uh \u2013 having mortgage payments uh lower at the beginning of any mortgage period. We\u2019re expanding our homestead uh \u2013 housing program. The net result is uh \u2013 we think under Carla Hills, who\u2019s the chairman of my uh \u2013 urban development and uh \u2013 neighborhood revitalization program, we will really do a first-class job in helping uh \u2013 the communities throughout the country. As a matter of fact, that committee under Secretary Hills released about a seventy-five-page report with specific recommendations so we can do a better job uh \u2013 the weeks ahead. And in addition, the tax program of the Ford administration, which provides an incentive for industry to move into our major uh \u2013 metropolitan areas, into the inner cities, will bring jobs where people are, and help to revitalize those cities as they can be."}

The Office of Small Business, under Mr. Kobelinski, has a very massive program trying to help the black community. The individual who wants to start a business or expand his business as a black businessman is able to borrow, either directly or with guaranteed loans. I believe on the record that this administration has been more responsive and we have carried out the law to the letter, and I\u2019m proud of the record."}

I think it\u2019s accurate to say that Mr. Ford voted against the uh \u2013 Voting Rights Acts and the uh \u2013 Civil Rights Acts in their uh \u2013 debative stage I think once it was assured they were going to pass he finally voted for it. This country uh \u2013 changed drastically in 1969 when the uh \u2013 terms of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were over and Richard Nixon and \u2013 and Gerald Ford became the presidents. There was a time when there was hope for those who uh \u2013 were poor and downtrodden and who were \u2013 uh elderly or who were \u2013 uh ill or who were in minority groups, but that time has been gone. I think the greatest thing that ever happened to the South was the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the opening up of opportunities \u2013 uh to black people \u2013 the chance to vote, to hold a job, to buy a house, to go to school, and to participate in public affairs. It not only liberated \u2013 uh black people but it also liberated the whites. We\u2019ve seen uh \u2013 in many instances in recent years a minority affairs uh \u2013 section of uh Small Loan Administration, uh \u2013 Small Business Administration lend uh \u2013 a black entrepreneur just enough money to get started, and then to go bankrupt. The bankruptcies have gone up \u2013 uh in an extraordinary degree. Uh \u2013 FHA, which used to be a very responsible agency, uh \u2013 that everyone looked to to help own a home, lost six million dollars last year. There\u2019ve been over thirteen hundred indictments in HUD, over eight hundred convictions relating just to home loans. And now the federal government has become the world\u2019s greatest slum landlord. We\u2019ve got a 30 percent or 40 percent unemployment rate among minority uh \u2013 young people. And there\u2019s been no concerted effort given to the needs of those who are both poor and black, or poor and who speak a foreign language. And that\u2019s where there\u2019s been a great uh generation of despair, and ill health, and the lack of education, lack of purposefulness, and the lack of hope for the future. But it doesn\u2019t take just a quiet uh \u2013 dormant uh minimum enforcement of the law. It requires an aggressive searching out and reaching out to help people who especially need it. And that\u2019s been lacking in the last eight years."}

But short of the constitutional amendment, and within the confines of the Supreme Court rulings, I\u2019ll do everything I can to minimize the need for abortions with better sex education, family planning, with better adoptive procedures. I personally don\u2019t believe that the federal government oughta finance abortions, but I \u2013 I draw the line and don\u2019t support a constitutional amendment.

Uh I call that the people amendment. I think if you really believe that the people of a state ought to make a decision on a matter of this kind that uh \u2013 we ought to have a federal constitutional amendment that would permit each one of the fifty states to make the choice. Uh \u2013 I think this is a responsible and a proper way to proceed.

The record just doesn\u2019t prove that such legislation or action by a local city council is effective. What we have to do, and this is the crux of the matter, is to make it very, very uh \u2013 difficult for a person who uses a gun in the commission of a crime to stay out of jail. If we make the use of a gun in the commission. of a crime a serious criminal offense, and that person is prosecuted, then, in my opinion, we are going after the person who uses the gun for the wrong reason. I don\u2019t believe in the registration of handguns or the registration of the handgun owner. That has not proven to be effective, and therefore, I think the better way is to go after the criminal, the individual who commits a crime in the possession of a gun and uses that gun for a part of his criminal activity. Those are the people who ought to be in jail. And the only way to do it is to pass strong legislation so that once apprehended, indicted, convicted, they\u2019ll be in jail and off the streets and not using guns in the commission of a crime."}

We uh \u2013 streamlined the structure of the court, put in administrative officers, put a unified court system in, required that all uh \u2013 severe sentences be reviewed far uniformity. And, in addition to that put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office of selection of \u2013 for all judges and district attorneys or prosecuting attorneys, on the basis of merit. Every time I had a vacancy on the Georgia Supreme Court \u2013 and I filled five of those vacancies out of seven total and about half the court of appeals judges, about 35 percent of the trial judges \u2013 I was given from an objective panel the five most highly qualified persons in Georgia. And from those five, I always chose the first one or second one. So merit selection of judges is the most important single criterion. And I would institute the same kind of procedure as president, not only in judicial appointments, but also in diplomatic appointments. Secondly, I think that the Burger Court has fairly well confirmed the major and \u2013 and most far-reaching and most controversial decisions of the Warren Court. Civil rights \u2013 uh has been confirmed by the Burger Court, hasn\u2019t been uh \u2013 reversed, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any inclination to reverse those basic decisions. The one-man, one-vote rule, which is a very important one that uh \u2013 s- struck down the unwarranted influence in the legislature of parsley \u2013 uh populated areas of \u2013 of the states.

But the only uh \u2013 thing I uh \u2013 have pointed out was, what I\u2019ve just said, and that there was a need to clarify the technicalities so that you couldn\u2019t be forced to release a person who was obviously guilty just because of a \u2013 of a small technicality in the law. And \u2013 and that\u2019s a reversal of position uh by the Burger Court with which I do agree."}

We\u2019ve got seven and a half million people out of jobs. Since he\u2019s been in office, two and a half million more American people have lost their jobs. In the last four months alone, five hundred thousand Americans have gone on the unemployment roll. In the last month, we\u2019ve had a net loss of one hundred and sixty-three thousand jobs. Anybody who says that the inflation rate is in good shape now ought to talk to the housewives. One of the overwhelming results that I\u2019ve seen in the polls is that people feel that you can\u2019t plan anymore. There\u2019s no way to make a prediction that my family might be able to own a home or to put my kid through college. Savings accounts are losing money instead of gaining money. Inflation is robbing us. Under the present administration \u2013 Nixon\u2019s and Ford\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve had three times the inflation rate that we experienced under President Johnson and President Kennedy. The economic growth is less than half today what it was at the beginning of this year. And housing starts \u2013 he compares the housing starts with last year. I don\u2019t blame him, because in 1975 we had fewer housing starts in this country, fewer homes built, than any year since 1940. That\u2019s thirty-five years. And we\u2019ve got a 35 percent unemployment rate in many areas of this country among construction workers. And Mr. Ford hasn\u2019t done anything about it. And I think this shows a callous indifference to the families that have suffered so much. He has vetoed bills passed by Congress within the congressional budget guidelines job opportunities for two million Americans. We\u2019ll never have a balanced budget, we\u2019ll never meet the needs of our people, we\u2019ll never control the inflationary spiral, as long as we have seven and a half or eight million people out of work, who are looking for jobs. And we\u2019ve probably got two and a half more million people who are not looking for jobs any more, because they\u2019ve given up hope. That is a very serious indictment of this administration. It\u2019s probably the worst one of all."}

The major purpose of an election for president is to choose a leader. Someone who can analyze the depths of feeling in our country to set a standard for our people to follow, to inspire our people to reach for greatness, to correct our defects, to answer difficult questions, to bind ourselves together in a spirit of unity. I don\u2019t believe the present administration has done that. We have been discouraged and we\u2019ve been alienated. Sometimes we\u2019ve been embarrassed and sometimes we\u2019ve been ashamed. Our people are out of work, and there\u2019s a sense of withdrawal. But our country is innately very strong. Mr. Ford is a good and decent man, but he\u2019s in \u2013 been in office now more than eight hundred days approaching almost as long as John Kennedy was in office. I\u2019d like to ask the American people what, what\u2019s been accomplished. A lot remains to be done. My own background is different from his. I was a school board member, and a library board member. I served an a hospital authority. And I was in the state senate and I was governor and I\u2019m an engineer, a Naval officer, a farmer, a businessman. And I believe we require someone who can work harmoniously with the Congress, who can work closely with the people of this country, and who can bring a new image and a new spirit to Washington. Our tax structure is a disgrace, it needs to be reformed. I was Governor of Georgia for four years. We never increased sales taxes or income tax or property tax. As a matter of fact, the year before I went out of office we gave a $50 million refund to the property taxpayers of Georgia. We spend six hundred dollars per person in this country \u2013 every man, woman and child \u2013 for health care. We still rank fifteenth among all the nations of the world in infant mortality. And our cancer rate is uh \u2013 higher than any country in the world. We don\u2019t have good health care. We could have it. Employment ought to be restored to our people. We\u2019ve become almost a welfare state. We spend now 700 percent more on unemployment compensation than we did eight years ago when the Republicans took over the White House. Our people wanna go back to work. Our education system can be improved. Secrecy ought to be stripped away from government and a maximum of personal privacy ought to be maintained. Our housing programs have uh \u2013 gone bad. It used to be that the average \u2013 uh family could own a house. But now less than a third of our people can afford to buy their own homes. The budget was more grossly out of balance last year than ever before in the history of our country \u2013 $65 billion \u2013 primarily because our people are not at work. Inflation is robbing us, as we\u2019ve already discussed, and the government bureaucracy is uh \u2013 just a horrible mess. This doesn\u2019t have to be. Now I don\u2019t know all the answers. Nobody could. But I do know that if the president of the United States and the Congress of the United States and the people of the United States said, \u201cI believe our nation is greater than what we are now.\u201d I believe that if we are inspired, if we can achieve a degree of unity, if we can set our goals high enough and work toward recognized goals with industry and labor and agriculture along with government at all levels, then we can achieve great things. We might have to do it slowly. There are no magic answers to do it. But I believe together we can make great progress. We can correct our difficult mistakes and answer those very tough questions. I believe in the greatness of our country, and I believe the American people are ready for a change in Washington. We\u2019ve been drifting too long. We\u2019ve been dormant too long. We\u2019ve been discouraged too long. And we have not set an example for our own people. But I believe that we can now establish in the White House a good relationship with Congress, a good relationship with our people, set very high goals for our country. And with inspiration and hard work we can achieve great things. And let the world know \u2013 that\u2019s very important. But more importantly, let the people in our own country realize that we still live in the greatest nation on earth. Thank you very much."}

SMITH","Speaker":"SENATOR KENNEDY","Party":"Democratic","Factor 1":18,"Factor 2":80,"Factor 3":-13,"Factor 4":4,"Factor 5":3,"Factor 6":6,"Text":"Mr. Smith, Mr. Nixon. In the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln said the question was whether this nation could exist half-slave or half-free. In the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half-slave or half-free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, in the direction of the road that we are taking, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery. I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain. We discuss tonight domestic issues, but I would not want that to be any implication to be given that this does not involve directly our struggle with Mr. Khrushchev for survival. Mr. Khrushchev is in New York, and he maintains the Communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the Soviet Union itself. The Chinese Communists have always had a large population. But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country. The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom. If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if we\u2019re moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world. If we fail, then freedom fails. Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do? Are we as strong as we should be? Are we as strong as we must be if we\u2019re going to maintain our independence, and if we\u2019re going to maintain and hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to us for assistance, to those who look to us for survival? I should make it very clear that I do not think we\u2019re doing enough, that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we\u2019re making. This is a great country, but I think it could be a greater country; and this is a powerful country, but I think it could be a more powerful country. I\u2019m not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel-mill capacity unused. I\u2019m not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world. Because economic growth means strength and vitality; it means we\u2019re able to sustain our defenses; it means we\u2019re able to meet our commitments abroad. I\u2019m not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food \u2013 some of it rotting \u2013 even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual. I saw cases in West Virginia, here in the United States, where children took home part of their school lunch in order to feed their families because I don\u2019t think we\u2019re meeting our obligations toward these Americans. I\u2019m not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are. I\u2019m not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part-time shifts. I think we should have an educational system second to none. I\u2019m not satisfied when I see men like Jimmy Hoffa \u2013 in charge of the largest union in the United States \u2013 still free. I\u2019m not satisfied when we are failing to develop the natural resources of the United States to the fullest. Here in the United States, which developed the Tennessee Valley and which built the Grand Coulee and the other dams in the Northwest United States at the present rate of hydropower production \u2013 and that is the hallmark of an industrialized society \u2013 the Soviet Union by 1975 will be producing more power than we are. These are all the things, I think, in this country that can make our society strong, or can mean that it stands still. I\u2019m not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights. If a Negro baby is born \u2013 and this is true also of Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in some of our cities \u2013 he has about one-half as much chance to get through high school as a white baby. He has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student. He has about a third as much chance to be a professional man, about half as much chance to own a house. He has about uh \u2013 four times as much chance that he\u2019ll be out of work in his life as the white baby. I think we can do better. I don\u2019t want the talents of any American to go to waste. I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government. I don\u2019t at all. I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities. And I want the states to meet their responsibilities. But I think there is also a national responsibility. The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty-five years. The people of the United States individually could not have developed the Tennessee Valley; collectively they could have. A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so. Seventeen million Americans, who live over sixty-five on an average Social Security check of about seventy-eight dollars a month, they\u2019re not able to sustain themselves individually, but they can sustain themselves through the social security system. I don\u2019t believe in big government, but I believe in effective governmental action. And I think that\u2019s the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom. It\u2019s the only way that we\u2019re going to move ahead. I think we can do a better job. I think we\u2019re going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us. We cannot turn the job over to anyone else. If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails. And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country. The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States. Because they felt that the American society was moving again. I want us to recapture that image. I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how we\u2019re doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese Communists. That is the obligation upon our generation. In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt said in his inaugural that this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny. I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous. The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack \u2013 attack it has ever known? I think it can be. And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here. I think it\u2019s time America started moving again."}

SMITH","Speaker":"MR. NIXON","Party":"Republican","Factor 1":52,"Factor 2":54,"Factor 3":-6,"Factor 4":3,"Factor 5":2,"Factor 6":4,"Text":"Mr. Smith, Senator Kennedy. The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with. There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position. There is no question but that this nation cannot stand still; because we are in a deadly competition, a competition not only with the men in the Kremlin, but the men in Peking. We\u2019re ahead in this competition, as Senator Kennedy, I think, has implied. But when you\u2019re in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead. And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the United States should move ahead. Where, then, do we disagree? I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still. We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world. Now last year, of course, was 1958. That happened to be a recession year. But when we look at the growth of G.N.P. this year, a year of recovery, we find that it\u2019s six and nine-tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today. More about that later. Looking then to this problem of how the United States should move ahead and where the United States is moving, I think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner: Let\u2019s look at the record. Is the United States standing still? Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation? Is it true that, as far as this country is concerned, in the field of electric power, in all of the fields that he has mentioned, we have not been moving ahead. Well, we have a comparison that we can make. We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration. When we compare these two records in the areas that Senator Kennedy has \u2013 has discussed tonight, I think we find that America has been moving ahead. Let\u2019s take schools. We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years. Let\u2019s take hydroelectric power. We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history. Let us take hospitals. We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration. The same is true of highways. Let\u2019s put it in terms that all of us can understand. We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven years. That shows that there\u2019s been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor. But let\u2019s not put it there; let\u2019s put it in terms of the average family. What has happened to you? We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration. What about the prices you pay? We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration. What\u2019s the net result of this? This means that the average family income went up fifteen per cent in the Eisenhower years as against two per cent in the Truman years. Now, this is not standing still. But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isn\u2019t enough. A record is never something to stand on. It\u2019s something to build on. And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress. And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way. Senator Kennedy has suggested that he believes he knows the way. I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion. But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new. They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it. And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then. What kind of programs are we for? We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people. We are for programs, in addition, which will see that our medical care for the aged are \u2013 is \u2013 are much \u2013 is much better handled than it is at the present time. Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims. We both want to help the old people. We want to see that they do have adequate medical care. The question is the means. I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates. I could give better examples, but for \u2013 for whatever it is, whether it\u2019s in the field of housing, or health, or medical care, or schools, or the eh- development of electric power, we have programs which we believe will move America, move her forward and build on the wonderful record that we have made over these past seven and a half years. Now, when we look at these programs, might I suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much you\u2019re spending. I will concede that in all the areas to which I have referred Senator Kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than I would have it spend. I costed out the cost of the Democratic platform. It runs a minimum of thirteen and two-tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than we\u2019re presently spending. Now the Republican platform will cost more too. It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than we\u2019re presently spending. Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours? Not at all. Because it isn\u2019t a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn\u2019t a question of which government does the most. It is a question of which administration does the right thing. And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans. I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress. The final point that I would like to make is this: Senator Kennedy has suggested in his speeches that we lack compassion for the poor, for the old, and for others that are unfortunate. Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere. I know what it means to be poor. I know what it means to see people who are unemployed. I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals."}

Within the Administration, as a chairman of the President\u2019s Committee on Price Stability and Economic Growth, I have had the opportunity to make recommendations which have been adopted within the Administration and which I think have been reasonably effective. I know Senator Kennedy suggested in his speech at Cleveland yesterday that that committee had not been particularly effective. I would only suggest that while we do not take the credit for it \u2013 I would not presume to \u2013 that since that committee has been formed the price line has been held very well within the United States."}

I prefer to take the overall percentage record of the last twenty years of the Democrats and the eight years of the Republicans to show an overall period of growth. In regard to uh \u2013 price stability uh \u2013 I\u2019m not aware that that committee did produce recommendations that ever were certainly before the Congress from the point of view of legislation in regard to controlling prices. In regard to the exchange of students and labor unions, I am chairman of the subcommittee on Africa and I think that one of the most unfortunate phases of our policy towards that country was the very minute number of exchanges that we had. I think it\u2019s true of Latin America also. We did come forward with a program of students for the Congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of Africa the previous year, so that I don\u2019t think that uh \u2013 we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor."}

In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960. What I have talked about, however, the kind of programs that I\u2019ve talked about, in my judgment, are uh \u2013 fiscally sound. Medical care for the aged, I would put under social security. The Vice President and I disagree on this. The program \u2013 the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon-Javits program \u2013 would have cost, if fully used uh \u2013 six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state. The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security, and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax. Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers\u2019 salaries. I think that\u2019s a good investment. I think we\u2019re going to have to do it. And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated. There is no greater return to an economy or to a society than an educational system second to none. On the question of the development of natural resources, I would pay as you go in the sense that they would be balanced and the power revenues would bring back sufficient money to finance the projects, in the same way as the Tennessee Valley. I believe in the balanced budget. And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession. Otherwise, with a steady rate of economic growth \u2013 and Mr. Nixon and Mr. Rockefeller, in their meeting, said a five per cent economic growth would bring by 1962 ten billion dollars extra in tax revenues. Whatever is brought in, I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget, if business remains orderly."}

I think what Mr. Novins was referring to was not one of Senator Kennedy\u2019s speeches, but the Democratic platform, which did mention cutting the national debt. I think, too, that it should be pointed out that of course it is not possible, particularly under the proposals that Senator Kennedy has advocated, either to cut the national debt or to reduce taxes. As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes. As Senator Kennedy points out that as far as his one proposal is concerned \u2013 the one for medical care for the aged \u2013 that that would be financed out of Social Security. That, however, is raising taxes for those who pay Social Security. He points out that he would make pay-as-you-go be the basis for our natural resources development. Where our natural resources development \u2013 which I also support, incidentally, however \u2013 whenever you uh \u2013 uh \u2013 in \u2013 in \u2013 uh \u2013 appropriates money for one of these projects, you have to pay now and appropriate the money and the eh- while they eventually do pay out, it doesn\u2019t mean that you \u2013 the government doesn\u2019t have to put out the money this year. And so I would say that in all of these proposals Senator Kennedy has made, they will result in one of two things: either he has to raise taxes or he has to unbalance the budget. If he unbalances the budget, that means you have inflation, and that will be, of course, a very cruel blow to the very people \u2013 the older people \u2013 that we\u2019ve been talking about. As far as aid for school construction is concerned, I favor that, as Senator Kennedy did, in January of this year, when he said he favored that rather than aid to s- teacher salaries. I favor that because I believe that\u2019s the best way to aid our schools without running any risk whatever of the federal government telling our teachers what to teach."}

Uh \u2013 I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh \u2013 pay teachers\u2019 salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers\u2019 salaries \u2013 at least that\u2019s the way I read his remarks. Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers\u2019 salaries? Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then? Why do I take it now? We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers\u2019 salaries. We need higher teachers\u2019 salaries. But we also want our education to be free of federal control. When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach. I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession. There is another point that should be made. I favor higher salaries for teachers. But, as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference, the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction, which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers\u2019 salaries. I should also point out this; once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers\u2019 salaries, your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should. I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility. Teachers\u2019 salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries. This is not enough; it should be more. But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program. My objection here is not the cost in dollars. My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have."}

The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state. The state then could determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher salaries. On that question the Vice President and I disagreed. I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly, because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I disagreed, and his tie vote uh \u2013 defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal. I don\u2019t want the federal government paying teachers\u2019 salaries directly. But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers\u2019 salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee. And therefore I think that was a sound proposal and that is why I supported it and I regret that it did not pass. Secondly, there have been statements made that uh \u2013 the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget. That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars. That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record. My view is that you can do these programs \u2013 and they should be carefully drawn \u2013 within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead."}

It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives. It was killed in the Rules Committee. And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House.

Thirdly, on medical care for the aged, this is the same fight that\u2019s been going on for twenty-five years in Social Security. We wanted to tie it to Social Security. We offered an amendment to do so. Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it. And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it. In my judgment, a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs. But if you send a Republican president and a Democratic majority and the threat of a veto hangs over the Congress, in my judgment you will continue what happened in the August session, which is a clash of parties and inaction."}

It would seem to me again that it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the eight Democrats\u2019 not getting a something through that particular committee. I would say further that to blame the President in his veto power for the inability of the Senator and his colleagues to get action in this special session uh \u2013 misses the mark. When the president exercises his veto power, he has to have the people upo- behind him, not just a third of the Congress. Because let\u2019s consider it.

One was a bill for a dollar twenty-five cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s extreme at all; and yet nearly two-thirds to three-fourths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against that proposal. Secondly was the federal aid to education bill. It \u2013 it was a very uh \u2013 because of the defeat of teacher salaries, it was not a bill that uh \u2013 met in my opinion the need. The fact of the matter is it was a bill that was less than you recommended, Mr. Nixon, this morning in your proposal. It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House \u2013 not one Republican \u2013 and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it. I don\u2019t say the Democrats are united in their support of the program. But I do say a majority are. And I say a majority of the Republicans are opposed to it. The third is medical care for the aged which is tied to Social Security, which is financed out of Social Security funds. It does not put a deficit on the Treasury. The proposal advanced by you and by Mr. Javits would have cost six hundred millions of dollars \u2013 Mr. Rockefeller rejected it in New York, said he didn\u2019t agree with the financing at all, said it ought to be on Social Security. So these are three programs which are quite moderate. I think it shows the difference between the two parties. One party is ready to move in these programs. The other party gives them lip service."}

The question of Communism within the United States has been one that has worried us in the past. It is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come. We have to remember that the cold war that Mr. Khrushchev is waging and his colleagues are waging, is waged all over the world and it\u2019s waged right here in the United States. That\u2019s why we have to continue to be alert. It is also essential in being alert that we be fair; fair because by being fair we uphold the very freedoms that the Communists would destroy. We uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow. And, in this connection, I think that uh \u2013 we must look to the future having in mind the fact that we fight Communism at home not only by our laws to deal with Communists uh \u2013 the few who do become Communists and the few who do become tra- fellow travelers, but we also fight Communism at home by moving against those various injustices which exist in our society which the Communists feed upon. And in that connection I again would say that while Senator Kennedy says we are for the status quo, I do believe that he uh \u2013 would agree that I am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education, my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his. The question again is not one of goals \u2013 we\u2019re for those goals \u2013 it\u2019s one of means."}

As a matter of fact your question brings out a point that I am very glad to make. Too often in appraising whether we are moving ahead or not we think only of what the federal government is doing. Now that isn\u2019t the test of whether America moves. The test of whether America moves is whether the federal government, plus the state government, plus the local government, plus the biggest segment of all \u2013 individual enterprise \u2013 moves. We have for example a gross national product of approximately five hundred billion dollars. Roughly a hundred billion to a hundred and a quarter billion of that is the result of government activity. Four hundred billion, approximately, is a result of what individuals do. Now, the reason the Eisenhower Administration has moved, the reason that we\u2019ve had the funds, for example, locally to build the schools, and the hospitals, and the highways, to make the progress that we have, is because this Administration has encouraged individual enterprise; and it has resulted in the greatest expansion of the private sector of the economy that has ever been witnessed in an eight-year period. And that is growth. That is the growth that we are looking for; it is the growth that this Administration has supported and that its policies have stimulated."}

I think what we have to do, however, is have the president and the leadership set before our country exactly what we must do in the next decade, if we\u2019re going to maintain our security in education, in economic growth, in development of natural resources. The Soviet Union is making great gains. It isn\u2019t enough to compare what might have been done eight years ago, or ten years ago, or fifteen years ago, or twenty years ago. I want to compare what we\u2019re doing with what our adversaries are doing, so that by the year 1970 the United States is ahead in education, in health, in building, in homes, in economic strength. I think that\u2019s the big assignment, the big task, the big function of the federal government."}

First of all, I think it is well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the Soviet Union in this whole matter of growth. The Soviet Union has been moving faster than we have. But the reason for that is obvious. They start from a much lower base. Although they have been moving faster in growth than we have, we find, for example, today that their total gross national product is only forty-four per cent of our total gross national product. That\u2019s the same percentage that it was twenty years ago. And as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago. Is this any reason for complacency? Not at all Because these are determined men. They are fanatical men. And we have to get the very most of uh \u2013 out uh \u2013 out of our economy. I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score. Where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy. I respectfully submit that Senator Kennedy too often would rely too much on the federal government, on what it would do to solve our problems, to stimulate growth. I believe that when we examine the Democratic platform, when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight, when we compare them with the proposals that I have made, that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that I have advocated. There are many of the points that he has made that I would like to comment upon. The one in the field of health is worth mentioning. Our health program \u2013 the one that Senator Javits and other Republican Senators, as well as I supported \u2013 is one that provides for all people over sixty-five who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it. It provides a choice of having either government insurance or private insurance. But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it. His program under Social Security, would require everybody who had Social Security to take government health insurance whether he wanted it or not. And it would not cover several million people who are not covered by Social Security at all. Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his. The other point that I would make is this: this downgrading of how much things cost I think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when \u2013 during the Truman Administration when the government was spending more than it took in \u2013 we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation. We found the people who could least afford it \u2013 people on retired incomes uh \u2013 people on fixed incomes \u2013 we found them unable to meet their bills at the end of the month. It is essential that a man who\u2019s president of this country certainly stand for every program that will mean for growth. And I stand for programs that will mean growth and progress. But it is also essential that he not allow a dollar spent that could be better spent by the people themselves."}

NIXON","Party":"Republican","Factor 1":4,"Factor 2":21,"Factor 3":0,"Factor 4":2,"Factor 5":-4,"Factor 6":2,"Text":"My intentions in the field of civil rights have been spelled out in the Republican platform. I think we have to make progress first in the field of employment. And there we would give statutory authority to the Committee on Government Contracts, which is an effective way of getting real progress made in this area, since about one out of every four jobs is held by and is allotted by people who have government contracts. Certainly I think all of us agree that when anybody has a government contract, certainly the money that is spent under that contract ought to be disbursed equally without regard to the race or creed or color of the individual who is to be employed. Second, in the field of schools, we believe that there should be provisions whereby the federal government would give assistance to those districts who do want to integrate their schools. That of course was rejected as was the government contracts provision by the special session of the Congress to \u2013 in which Mr. Kennedy was quite active. And then as far as other areas are concerned, I think that we have to look to presidential leadership. And when I speak of presidential leadership, I refer for example to our attitude on the sit-in strikes. Here we have a situation which causes all of us concern \u2013 causes us concern because of the denial of the rights of people to the equality which we think belongs to everybody. I have talked to Negro mothers. I\u2019ve heard them explain \u2013 try to explain \u2013 how they tell their children how they can go into a store and buy a loaf of bread but then can\u2019t go into that store and sit at the counter and get a Coca Cola. This is wrong, and we have to do something about it. So, under the circumstances, what do we do? Well what we do is what the Attorney-General of the United States did under the direction of the President: call in the owners of chain stores and get them to take action. Now there are other places where the executive can lead, but let me just sum up by saying this: why do I talk every time I\u2019m in the South on civil rights? Not because I am preaching to the people of the South because this isn\u2019t just a Southern problem; it\u2019s a Northern problem and a Western problem; it\u2019s a problem for all of us. I do it because it\u2019s the responsibility of leadership, I do it because we have to solve this problem together. I do it right at this time particularly because when we have Khrushchev in this country \u2013 a man who has enslaved millions, a man who has slaughtered thousands \u2013 we cannot continue to have a situation where he can point the finger at the United States of America and say that we are denying rights to our citizens. And so I say both the candidates and both the vice presidential candidates, I would hope as well \u2013 including Senator Johnson \u2013 should talk on this issue at every opportunity."}

Giving aid to schools technically that are trying to carry out the decision is not the great question. Secondly, what\u2019s he going to do to provide fair employment? He\u2019s been the head of the Committee on Government Contracts that\u2019s carried out two cases, both in the District of Columbia. He has not indicated his support of an attempt to provide fair employment practices around the country, so that everyone can get a job regardless of their race or color. Nor has he indicated that he will support Title Three, which would give the Attorney General additional powers to protect Constitutional rights. These are the great questions: equality of education in school. About two percent of our population of white people are \u2013 is illiterate, ten per cent of our colored population. Sixty to seventy percent of our colored children do not finish high school. These are the questions in these areas that the North and South, East and West are entitled to know. What will be the leadership of the president in these areas to provide equality of opportunity for employment? Equality of opportunity in the field of housing, which could be done on all federal supported housing by a stroke of the president\u2019s pen. What will be done to provide equality of education in all sections of the United States? Those are the questions to which the president must establish a moral tone and moral leadership. And I can assure you that if I\u2019m elected president we will do so."}

Let me s- look also at what I did. I selected a man who stands with me in this field and who will talk with me and work with me on it. Now the Senator referred to the Committee on Government Contracts. And yet that very committee of which I am chairman has been handicapped by the fact that we have not had adequate funds; we have not had adequate powers; we haven\u2019t had an adequate staff. Now in the special session of Congress and also in the session that preceded it, the Democratic Congress \u2013 in which there\u2019s a two-to-one Democratic majority \u2013 was asked by the President to give us the funds and give us the power to do a job and they did nothing at all, And in the special session in which Senator Kennedy was calling the signals, along with Senator Johnson, they turned it down and he himself voted against giving us the powers despite the fact that the bill had already been considered before, that it already had hearings on, and the Congress already knew what it had before it. All that I can say is this: what we need here are not just high hopes. What we need is action.

Nineteen fifty-three we tried to put an appropriation of five billion dollars for our defenses. I was responsible for the amendment with Senator Monroney in 1954 to strengthen our ground forces. The Congress of the United States appropriated six hundred and seventy-seven million dollars mare than the President was willing to use up till a week ago. Secondly, on the question of our position in the United Nations. We all know about the vote held this week \u2013 of the five neutralists \u2013 and it was generally regarded as a defeat for the United States. Thirdly, in 1952, there were only seven votes in favor of the admission of Red China into the United Nations. Last year there were twenty-nine and tomorrow when the preliminary vote is held you will see a strengthening of that position or very closely to it. We have not maintained our position and our prestige. A Gallup Poll taken in February of this year asking the \u2013 in eight out of nine countries \u2013 they asked the people, who do they think would be ahead by 1970 militarily and scientifically, and a majority in eight of the nine countries said the Soviet Union would be by 1970. Governor Rockefeller has been far more critical in June of our position in the world than I have been. The Rockefeller Brothers report, General Ridgway, General Gavin, the Gaither Report, various reports of Congressional committees all indicate that the relative strength of the p- United States both militarily, politically, psychologically, and scientifically and industrially \u2013 the relative strength of the so- of United States compared to that of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists together \u2013 has deteriorated in the last eight years and we should know it, and the American people should be told the facts."}

We have been wholly indifferent to Latin America until the last few months. The program that was put forward this summer, after we broke off the sugar quota with Cuba, really was done because we wanted to get through the O.A.S. meeting a condemnation of Russian infiltration of Cuba. And therefore we passed an authorization \u2013 not an aid bill \u2013 which was the first time, really, since the Inter-American Bank which was founded a year ago was developed, that we really have looked at the needs of Latin America; that we have associated ourselves with those people. Secondly, I believe that in the ca- that it\u2019s far better for the United States, instead of concentrating our aid, particularly in the underdeveloped world, on surplus military equipment \u2013 we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into Laos. We paid more military aid, more aid into Laos po- per \u2013 per person than in any country in the world and we ought to know now that Laos is moving from neutralism in the direction of the Communists. I believe instead of doing that, we should concentrate our aid in long-term loans which these people can pay back either in hard money or in local currency. This permits them to maintain their self-respect. It permits us to make sure that the projects which are invested in are going to produce greater wealth. And I believe that in cases of India and Africa and Latin America that this is where our emphasis should be. I would strengthen the Development Loan Fund. And Senator Fulbright, Senator Humphrey and I tried to do that. We tried to provide an appropriation of a billion and a half for five years, on a long-term loan basis, which this Administration opposed. And unless we\u2019re ready to carry out programs like that in the sixties, this battle for economic survival which these people are waging are going to be lost. And if India should lose her battle, with thirty-five per cent of the people of the underdeveloped world within her borders, then I believe that the balance of power could move against us. I think the United States can afford to do these things. I think that we could not afford not to do these things. This goes to our survival. And here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if it\u2019s developing its economy to the fullest \u2013 which we are not now \u2013 in my judgment, we\u2019ll have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas. I believe it\u2019s essential that we do it because in the next ten years the balance of power is going to begin to move in the world from one direction or another \u2013 towards us or towards the Communists \u2013 and unless we begin to identify ourselves not only with the anti-Communist fight, but also with the fight against poverty and hunger, these people are going to begin to turn to the Communists as an example. I believe we can do it. If we build our economy the way we should, we can afford to do these things and we must do it."}

Now in the last Congress \u2013 the special session of the Congress \u2013 there was a bill: one by the President, one by Senator Kennedy and members of his party. Now the bill that the President had submitted would have provided more aid for those areas that really need it \u2013 areas like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and the areas of West Virginia \u2013 than the ones that Senator Kennedy was supporting. On the other hand we found that the bill got into the legislative difficulties and consequently no action was taken. So point one, at the highest priority we must get a bill for depressed areas through the next Congress. I have made recommendations on that and I have discussed them previously and I will spell them out further in the campaign. Second, as we consider this problem of unemployment, we have to realize where it is. In analyzing the figures we will find that our unemployment exists among the older citizens; it exists also among those who are inadequately trained; that is, those who do not have an adequate opportunity for education. It also exists among minority groups. If we\u2019re going to combat unemployment, then, we have to do a better job in these areas. That\u2019s why I have a program for education, a program in the case of equal job opportunities, and one that would also deal with our older citizens. Now finally, with regard to the whole problem of combating recession, as you call it, we must use the full resources of the government in these respects: one, we must see to it that credit is expanded as we go into any recessionary period \u2013 and understand, I do not believe we\u2019re going into a recession. I believe this economy is sound and that we\u2019re going to move up. But second, in addition to that, if we do get into a recessionary period we should move on that part of the economy which is represented by the private sector, and I mean stimulate that part of the economy that can create jobs \u2013 the private sector of the economy. This means through tax reform and if necessary tax cuts that will stimulate more jobs. I favor that rather than massive federal spending programs which will come into effect usually long after you\u2019ve passed through the recessionary period. So we must use all of these weapons for the purpose of combating recession if it should come. But I do not expect it to come."}

I\u2019m very familiar with it. It came out of the committee of which I was the chairman \u2013 the labor subcommittee \u2013 in fifty-five. I was the floor manager. We passed an area redevelopment bill far more effective than the bill the Administration suggested, on two occasions, and the President vetoed it both times. We passed a bill again this year in the cong- in the Senate and it died in the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives. Let me make it very clear that the bill that Mr. Nixon talked about did not mention Wilkes-Barre or Scranton; it did not mention West Virginia. Our bill was far more effective. The bill introduced and erd- sponsored by Senator Douglas was far more effective in trying to stimulate the economy of those areas. Secondly, he has mentioned the problem of our older citizens. I cannot still understand why this Administration and Mr. Nixon oppose putting medical care for the aged under Social Security to give them some security. Third, I believe we should step up the use of our surplus foods in these areas until we\u2019re able to get the people back to work. Five cents a day \u2013 that\u2019s what the food package averages per person. Fourthly, I believe we should not carry out a hard money, high interest rate policy which helped intensify certainly the recession of 1958, and I think helped bring the slow-down of 1960. If we move into a recession in sixty-one, then I would agree that we have to put more money into the economy, and it can be done by either one of the two methods discussed. One is by ex- the programs such as aid to education. The other would be to make a judgment on what\u2019s the most effective tax program to stimulate our economy."}

In fact, it would be deflationary; it would cause great unemployment; it would cause a real slowdown in our economy. If it ever becomes necessary, and is wise economically and essential to our security, I would have no hesitancy in suggesting a tax increase or any other policy which would defend the United States. I have talked in every speech about the fact that these are going to be very difficult times in the nineteen-sixties and that we\u2019re going to have to meet our responsibilities as citizens. I\u2019m talking about a national mood. I\u2019m talking about our willingness to bear any burdens in order to maintain our own freedom and in order to meet our freedom around the globe. We don\u2019t know what the future\u2019s going to bring. But I would not want anyone to elect me uh \u2013 president of the United States \u2013 or vote for me \u2013 under the expectation that life would be easier if I were elected. Now, many of the programs that I\u2019m talking about \u2013 economic growth, care for the aged, development of our natural resources \u2013 build the strength of the United States. That\u2019s how the United States began to prepare for its great actions in World War II and in the post-war period. If we\u2019re moving ahead, if we\u2019re providing a viable economy, if our people have sufficient resources so that they can consume what we produce; then this country\u2019s on the move, then we\u2019re stronger, then we set a better example to the world. So we have the problem of not only building our own uh \u2013 military strength and extending uh \u2013 our policies abroad, we have to do a job here at home. So I believe that the policies that I recommend came under the general heading of strengthening the United States. We\u2019re using our steel capacity fifty-five per cent today. We\u2019re not able to consume what we\u2019re able to produce at a time when the Soviet Union is making great economic gains. And all I say is, I don\u2019t know what the sixties will bring \u2013 except I think they will bring hard times in the uh \u2013 international sphere; I hope we can move ahead here at home in the United States; I\u2019m confident we can do a far better job of mobilizing our economy and resources in the United States. And I merely say that they \u2013 if they elect me president, I will do my best to carry the United States through a difficult period; but I would not want people to elect me because I promised them the easy, soft life. I think it\u2019s going to be difficult; but I\u2019m confident that this country can meet its responsibilities."}

Mr. Benson, testifying on the food stamp plan in 1957, said there were twenty-five million Americans who could not afford a elementary low-cost diet.

I believe that we should not compare what our figures may be to India or some other country that has serious problems but to remember that we are the most prosperous country in the world and that these people are not getting adequate food. And they\u2019re not getting in many cases adequate shelter. And we ought to try to meet the problem. Secondly, Mr. Nixon has continued to state \u2013 and he stated it last week \u2013 these fantastic figures of what the Democratic budget would c- uh \u2013 platform would cost. They\u2019re wholly inaccurate. I said last week I believed in a balanced budget.

I suppose it was hoped when he made that speech that we wouldn\u2019t get into a war. But it didn\u2019t mean that. We had to go in when they came in. Now I think as far as Quemoy and Matsu are concerned, that the question is not these two little pieces of real estate \u2013 they are unimportant. It isn\u2019t the few people who live on them \u2013 they are not too important. It\u2019s the principle involved. These two islands are in the area of freedom. The Nationalists have these two islands. We should not uh \u2013 force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists. If we do that we start a chain reaction; because the Communists aren\u2019t after Quemoy and Matsu, they\u2019re a- they\u2019re after Formosa. In my opinion this is the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for America in Korea. I am against it. I would never tolerate it as president of the United States, and I will hope that Senator Kennedy will change his mind if he should be elected."}

It has stood for a strong foreign policy and a strong national defense, and as a result, produced Wilson, President Roosevelt, and President Truman. The Republican party has produced McKinley and Harding, Coolidge, Dewey, and Landon. They do stand for something. They stand for a whole different approach to the problems facing this country at home and abroad. That\u2019s the importance of party; only if it tells something about the record.

I do not mean by that that one party is a war party and the other party is a peace party.

Now on the question of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, I must say that I feel that another effort should be made by a new Administration in January of 1961, to renew negotiations with the Soviet Union and see whether it\u2019s possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chances of contamination of the atmosphere, and also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity. There are indications, because of new inventions, that ten, fifteen, or twenty nations will have a nuclear capacity \u2013 including Red China \u2013 by the end of the presidential office in 1964. This is extremely serious. There have been many wars in the history of mankind. And to take a chance uh \u2013 now be \u2013 and not make every effort that we could make to provide for some control over these weapons, I think would be a great mistake. One of my disagreements with the present Administration has been that I don\u2019t feel a real effort has been made an this very sensitive subject, not only of nuclear controls, but also of general disarmament. Less than a hundred people have been working throughout the entire federal government on this subject, and I believe it\u2019s been reflected in our success and failures at Geneva. Now, we may not succeed. The Soviet Union may not agree to an inspection system. We may be able to get satisfactory assurances. It may be necessary for us to begin testing again. But I hope the next Administration \u2013 and if I have anything to do with it, the next Administration will \u2013 make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels. These must be done. If we cannot succeed, then we must strengthen ourselves. But I would make the effort because I think the fate not only of our own civilization, but I think the fate of world and the future of the human race is involved in preventing a nuclear war."}

There isn\u2019t any question but that we must move forward in every possible way to reduce the danger of war; to move toward controlled disarmament; to control tests; but also let\u2019s have in mind this: when Senator Kennedy suggests that we haven\u2019t been making an effort, he simply doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. It isn\u2019t a question of the number of people who are working in an Administration. It\u2019s a question of who they are. This has been one of the highest level operations in the whole State Department right under the President himself. We have gone certainly the extra mile and then some in making offers to the Soviet Union on control of tests, on disarmament, and in every other way. And I just want to make one thing very clear. Yes, we should make a great effort. But under no circumstances must the United States ever make an agreement based on trust. There must be an absolute guarantee. Now, just a comment on Senator Kennedy\u2019s last answer. He forgets that in this same debate on the Formosa resolution, which he said he voted for \u2013 which he did \u2013 that he voted against an amendment, or was recorded against an amendment \u2013 and on this particular \u2013 or for an amendment, I should say \u2013 which passed the Senate overwhelmingly, seventy to twelve. And that amendment put the Senate of the United States on record with a majority of the Senator\u2019s own party voting for it, as well as the majority of Republicans \u2013 put them on record \u2013 against the very position that the Senator takes now of surrendering, of indicating in advance, that the United States will not defend the offshore islands."}

There were too many infantrymen there, not enough heavy artillery; and certainly I don\u2019t think there was any implication in Secretary Dulles\u2019 statement that Quemoy and Matsu should not be defended in the event that they were attacked, and that attack was a preliminary to an attack on Formosa. Now as far as President Eisenhower is concerned, I have often heard him discuss this question. As I uh \u2013 related a moment ago, the President has always indicated that we must not make the mistake in dealing with the dictator of indicating that we are going to make a concession at the point of a gun. Whenever you do that, inevitably the dictator is encouraged to try it again. So first it will be Quemoy and Matsu, next it may be Formosa. What do we do then? My point is this: that once you do this \u2013 follow this course of action \u2013 of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return. And that means war. We went through this tragic experience leading to World War II. We learned our lesson again in Korea, We must not learn it again. That is why I think the Senate was right, including a majority of the Democrats, a majority of the Republicans, when they rejected Senator Kennedy\u2019s position in 1955. And incidentally, Senator Johnson was among those who rejected that position \u2013 voted with the seventy against the twelve. The Senate was right because they knew the lesson of history. And may I say, too, that I would trust that Senator Kennedy would change his position on this \u2013 change it; because as long as he as a major presidential candidate continues to suggest that we are going to turn over these islands, he is only encouraging the aggressors \u2013 the Chinese Communist and the Soviet aggressors \u2013 to press the United States, to press us to the point where war would be inevitable. The road to war is always paved with good intentions. And in this instance the good intentions, of course, are a desire for peace. But certainly we\u2019re not going to have peace by giving in and indicating in advance that we are not going to defend what has become a symbol of freedom."}

Uh \u2013 I obviously don\u2019t think it\u2019s valid. I have supported the Administration\u2019s position and I think that that position has been correct; I think my position has been correct. As far as Indochina was concerned, I stated over and over again that it was essential during that period that the United States make it clear that we would not tolerate Indochina falling under Communist domination. Now, as a result of our taking the strong stand that we did, the civil war there was ended; and today, at least in the south of Indochina, the Communists have moved out and we do have a strong, free bastion there. Now, looking to the U-2 flights, I would like to point out that I have been supporting the President\u2019s position throughout. I think the President was correct in ordering these flights. I think the President was correct, certainly, in his decision to continue the flights while the conference was going on. I noted, for example, in reading a \u2013 uh \u2013 a \u2013 a particular discussion that Senator Kennedy had with Dave Garroway shortly after the uh \u2013 his statement about regrets, that uh \u2013 he made the statement that he felt that these particular flights uh \u2013 were ones that shouldn\u2019t have occurred right at that time, and the indication was how would Mr. Khrushchev had felt if we had uh \u2013 had a flight over the uni- how would we have felt if Mr. Khrushchev ha \u2013 uh \u2013 had a flight over the United States while uh \u2013 he was visiting here. And the answer, of course, is that Communist espionage goes on all the time. The answer is that the United States can\u2019t afford to have a es- an es \u2013 a espionage lack or should we s- uh \u2013 lag \u2013 or should I say uh \u2013 an intelligence lag \u2013 any more than we can afford to have a missile lag. Now, referring to your question with regard to Quemoy and Matsu. What I object to here is the constant reference to surrendering these islands. Senator Kennedy quotes the record, which he read from a moment ago, but what he forgets to point out is that the key vote \u2013 a uh \u2013 vote which I\u2019ve referred to several times \u2013 where he was in the minority was one which rejected his position. Now, why did they reject it? For the very reason that those Senators knew, as the President of the United States knew, that you should not indicate to the Communists in advance that you\u2019re going to surrender an area that\u2019s free. Why? Because they know as Senator Kennedy will have to know that if you do that you encourage them to more aggression."}

We must not be divided on this issue. The worst thing that I can think can happen in this campaign would be for it to be decided on religious issues.

I never suggested that compulsory arbitration was the solution for national emergency disputes. I\u2019m opposed to that, was opposed to it in October, 1958. I have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act. I don\u2019t know what other weapons the Vice President is talking about. I\u2019m talking about giving him four or five tools \u2013 not only the fact-finding committee that he now has under the injunction provision, not only the injunction, but also the power of the fact-finding commission to make recommendations \u2013 recommendations which would not be binding, but nevertheless would have great force of public opinion behind them. One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure. There might be others. By the president having five powers \u2013 four or five powers \u2013 and he only has very limited powers today, neither the company nor the union would be sure which power would be used; and therefore, there would be a greater incentive on both sides to reach an agreement themselves without taking it to the government. The difficulty now is the president\u2019s course is quite limited. He can set up a fact-finding committee. The fact-finding committee\u2019s powers are limited. He can provide an injunction if there\u2019s a national emergency for eighty days, then the strike can go on; and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the Congress. This is a difficult and sensitive matter. But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do. He could leave the parties in doubt as to which one he would use; and therefore there would be incentive, instead of as now \u2013 the steel companies were ready to take the strike because they felt the injunction of eighty days would break the union, which didn\u2019t happen."}

I\u2019m not satisfied with it even if there were no Communism in the world, but particularly when we\u2019re in the kind of a race we\u2019re in, we have got to see that America grows just as fast as we can, provided we grow soundly. Because even though we have maintained, as I pointed out in our first debate, the absolute gap over the Soviet Union; even though the growth in this Administration has been twice as much as it was in the Truman Administration; that isn\u2019t good enough. Because America must be able to grow enough not only to take care of our needs at home for better education and housing and health \u2013 all these things we want. We\u2019ve got to grow enough to maintain the forces that we have abroad and to wage the non-military battle for the war \u2013 uh \u2013 for the world in Asia, in Africa and Latin America. It\u2019s going to cost more money, and growth will help us to win that battle. Now, what do we do about it? And here I believe basically that what we have to do is to stimulate that sector of America, the private enterprise sector of the economy, in which there is the greatest possibility for expansion. So that is why I advocate a program of tax reform which will stimulate more investment in our economy. In addition to that, we have to move on other areas that are holding back growth. I refer, for example, to distressed areas. We have to move into those areas with programs so that we make adequate use of the resources of those areas. We also have to see that all of the people of the United States \u2013 the tremendous talents that our people have \u2013 are used adequately. That\u2019s why in this whole area of civil rights, the equality of opportunity for employment and education is not just for the benefit of the minority groups, it\u2019s for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need. And in addition to that, we need programs, particularly in higher education, which will stimulate scientific breakthroughs which will bring more growth. Now what all this, of course, adds up to is this: America has not been standing still. Let\u2019s get that straight. Anybody who says America\u2019s been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn\u2019t been traveling around America. He\u2019s been traveling in some other country. We have been moving. We have been moving much faster than we did in the Truman years. But we can and must move faster, and that\u2019s why I stand so strongly for programs that will move America forward in the sixties, move her forward so that we can stay ahead of the Soviet Union and win the battle for freedom and peace."}

Even if you put his income up ten percent, that would be two and three-quarters percent three pers- or three cents out of that twenty-five cents.

But anybody who suggests that that program would c- come to any figure indicated by the Vice President is in error. The Vice President suggested a number of things. He suggested that we aid distressed areas. The Administration has vetoed that bill passed by the Congress twice. He suggested we pass an aid to education bill. But the Administration and the Republican majority in the Congress has opposed any realistic aid to education. And the Vice President cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers\u2019 salaries in the Senate, which prevented that being added. This Administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth \u2013 which means jobs \u2013 of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959. And when we have to find twenty-five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years, we\u2019re going to have to grow more. Governor Rockefeller says five per cent.

I favor the present depletion allowance. I favor it not because I want to make a lot of oil men rich, but because I want to make America rich. Why do we have a depletion allowance? Because this is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to go out and explore for oil, to develop it. If we didn\u2019t have a depletion allowance of certainly, I believe, the present amount, we would have our oil exploration cut substantially in this country. Now, as far as my position then is concerned, it is exactly opposite to the Senator\u2019s. And it\u2019s because of my belief that if America is going to have the growth that he talks about and that I talk about and that we want, the thing to do is not to discourage individual enterprise, not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and minerals, but to encourage them. And so he would be doing exactly the wrong thing. One other thing. He suggests that there are a number of other items in this whole depletion field that could be taken into account. He also said a moment ago that we would get more money to finance his programs by revising the tax laws, including depletion. I should point out that as far as depletion allowances are concerned, the oil depletion allowance is one that provides eighty percent of all of those involved in depletion, so you\u2019re not going to get much from revenue insofar as depletion allowances are concerned, unless you move in the area that he indicated. But I oppose it. I oppose it for the reasons that I mentioned. I oppose it because I want us to have more oil exploration and not less."}

Let\u2019s look at the other side of the coin. Let\u2019s look at the vote on the Congo, the vote was seventy to nothing against the Soviet Union. Let\u2019s look at the situation with regard to economic growth as it really is. We find that the Soviet Union is a very primitive economy. Its growth rate is not what counts; it\u2019s whether it is catching up with us and it is not catching up with us. We\u2019re well ahead and we can stay ahead, provided we have confidence in America and don\u2019t run her down in order to build her up. We could look also at other items which Senator Kennedy has named, but I will only conclude by saying this: in this whole matter of prestige, in the final analysis, its whether you stand for what\u2019s right. And getting back to this matter that we discussed at the outset, the matter of Quemoy and Matsu. I can think of nothing that will be a greater blow to the prestige of the United States among the free nations in Asia than for us to take Senator Kennedy\u2019s advan- advice to go \u2013 go against what a majority of the members of the Senate, both Democrat and Republican, did \u2013 said in 1955, and to say in advance we will surrender an area to the Communists. In other words, if the United States is going to maintain its strength and its prestige, we must not only be strong militarily and economically, we must be firm diplomatically. Thi- Certainly we have been speaking, I know, of whether we should have retreat or defeat. Let\u2019s remember the way to win is not to retreat and not to surrender."}

NIXON","Party":"Republican","Factor 1":9,"Factor 2":88,"Factor 3":14,"Factor 4":-4,"Factor 5":-14,"Factor 6":4,"Text":"Mr. Howe, Senator Kennedy, my fellow Americans. Since this campaign began I have had a very rare privilege. I have traveled to forty-eight of the fifty states and in my travels I have learned what the people of the United States are thinking about. There is one issue that stands out above all the rest, one in which every American is concerned, regardless of what group he may be a member and regardless of where he may live. And that issue, very simply stated, is this: how can we keep the peace \u2013 keep it without surrender? How can we extend freedom \u2013 extend it without war? Now in determining how we deal with this issue, we must find the answer to a very important but simple question: who threatens the peace? Who threatens freedom in the world? There is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom \u2013 that that is presented by the international Communist movement. And therefore if we are to have peace, we must know how to deal with the Communists and their leaders. I know Mr. Khrushchev. I also have had the opportunity of knowing and meeting other Communist leaders in the world. I believe there are certain principles we must find in dealing with him and his colleagues \u2013 principles, if followed, that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom. First, we have to learn from the past, because we cannot afford to make the mistakes of the past. In the seven years before this Administration came into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain. And at the end of that seven years we were engaged in a war in Korea which cost of thirty thousand American lives. In the past seven years, in President Eisenhower\u2019s Administration, this situation has been reversed. We ended the Korean War; by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars; and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table. Now why were we successful, as our predecessors were not successful? I think there\u2019re several reasons. In the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the Communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world. One of the major errors they made was the one that led to the Korean War. In ruling out the defense of Korea, they invited aggression in that area. They thought they were going to have peace \u2013 it brought war. We learned from their mistakes. And so, in our seven years, we find that we have been firm in our diplomacy; we have never made concessions without getting concessions in return. We have always been willing to go the extra mile to negotiate for disarmament or in any other area. But we have never been willing to do anything that, in effect, surrendered freedom any place in the world. That is why President Eisenhower was correct in not apologizing or expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev at the Paris Conference, as Senator Kennedy suggested he could have done. That is why Senator wh- President Eisenhower was also correct in his policy in the Formosa Straits, where he declined, and refused to follow the recommendations \u2013 recommendations which Senator Kennedy voted for in 1955; again made in 1959; again repeated in his debates that you have heard \u2013 recommendations with regard to \u2013 again \u2013 slicing off a piece of free territory, and abandoning it, if \u2013 in effect, to the Communists. Why did the President feel this was wrong and why was the President right and his critics wrong? Because again this showed a lack of understanding of dictators, a lack of understanding particularly of Communists, because every time you make such a concession it does not lead to peace; it only encourages them to blackmail you. It encourages them to begin a war. And so I say that the record shows that we know how to keep the peace, to keep it without surrender. Let us move now to the future. It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical\u2026 leaders that the world has ever seen. That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area. First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have \u2013 if the should launch a surprise attack \u2013 we will be able to destroy their war-making capability. They must know, in other words, that it is national suicide if they begin anything. We need this kind of strength because we\u2019re the guardians of the peace. In addition to military strength, we need to see that the economy of this country continues to grow. It has grown in the past seven years. It can and will grow even more in the next four. And the reason that it must grow even more is because we have things to do at home and also because we\u2019re in a race for survival \u2013 a race in which it isn\u2019t enough to be ahead; it isn\u2019t enough simply to be complacent. We have to move ahead in order to stay ahead. And that is why, in this field, I have made recommendations which I am confident will move the American economy ahead \u2013 move it firmly and soundly so that there will never be a time when the Soviet Union will be able to challenge our superiority in this field. And so we need military strength, we need economic strength, we also need the right diplomatic policies. What are they? Again we turn to the past. Firmness but no belligerence, and by no belligerence I mean that we do not answer insult by insult. When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues. And that example that President Eisenhower has set we will continue to follow. But all this by itself is not enough. It is not enough for us simply to be the strongest nation militarily, the strongest economically, and also to have firm diplomacy. We must have a great goal. And that is: not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world, to extend it to all the world because that is America\u2019s destiny. To extend it to all the world because the Communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend Communism. And you cannot fight a victory for Communism or a strategy of victory for Communism with the strategy, simply of holding the line. And so I say that we believe that our policies of military strength, of economic strength, of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep it without surrender. We also believe that in the great field of ideals that we can lead America to the victory for freedom \u2013 victory in the newly developing countries, victory also in the captive countries \u2013 provided we have faith in ourselves and faith in our principles."}

I think that Senator Kennedy\u2019s policies and recommendations for the handling of the Castro regime are probably the most dangers- dangerously irresponsible recommendations that he\u2019s made during the course of this campaign. In effect, what Senator Kennedy recommends is that the United States government should give help to the exiles and to those within Cuba who oppose the Castro regime \u2013 provided they are anti-Batista. Now let\u2019s just see what this means. We have five treaties with Latin America, including the one setting up the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948, in which we have agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of any other American country \u2013 and they as well have agreed to do likewise. The charter of the United Nations \u2013 its Preamble, Article I and Article II \u2013 also provide that there shall be no intervention by one nation in the internal affairs of another. Now I don\u2019t know what Senator Kennedy suggests when he says that we should help those who oppose the Castro regime, both in Cuba and without. But I do know this: that if we were to follow that recommendation, that we would lose all of our friends in Latin America, we would probably be condemned in the United Nations, and we would not accomplish our objective. I know something else. It would be an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to come in, to come into Latin America and to engage us in what would be a civil war, and possibly even worse than that. This is the major recommendation that he\u2019s made. Now, what can we do? Well, we can do what we did with Guatemala. There was a Communist dictator that we inherited from the previous Administration. We quarantined Mr. Arbenz. The result was that the Guatemalan people themselves eventually rose up and they threw him out. We are quarantining Mr. Castro today. We\u2019re quarantining him diplomatically by bringing back our Ambassador; economically by cutting off trade, and Senator Kennedy\u2019s suggestion that the trade that we cut off is not significant is just one hundred percent wrong. We are cutting off the significant items that the Cuban regime needs in order to survive. By cutting off trade, by cutting off our diplomatic relations as we have, we will quarantine this regime so that the people of Cuba themselves will take care of Mr. Castro. But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want."}

This is a race between the Vice President and myself for the presidency of the United States. There are a good many able men who could be secretary of state. I\u2019ve made no judgment about who should be secretary of state. I think that judgment could be made after election, if I\u2019m successful. The people have to make a choice between Mr. Nixon and myself, between the Republican party and the Democratic party, between our approach to the problems which now disturb us as a nation and disturb us as a world power. The president bears the constitutional responsibility, not the secretary of state, for the conduct of foreign affairs. Some presidents have been strong in foreign policy; others have relied heavily on the secretary of state. I\u2019ve been a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; I run for the presidency with full knowledge that his great responsibility, really, given to him by the Constitution and by the force of events, is in the field of foreign affairs.

Now, in this connection I want to point out that the facts simply aren\u2019t as stated. First of all, the report to which Senator Kennedy refers is one that was made many, many months ago and related particularly to the uh \u2013 period immediately after Sputnik. Second, as far as this report is concerned, I would have no objection to having it made public. Third, I would say this with regard to this report, with regard to Gallup Polls of prestige abroad and everything else that we\u2019ve been hearing about \u201cwhat about American prestige abroad\u201d: America\u2019s prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for America allow it to be. Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example \u2013 Senator Kennedy \u2013 stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight \u2013 we\u2019ve had twenty-eight successful shots, they\u2019ve had eight; when he states that we\u2019re second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I\u2019ve seen ours, and we\u2019re not; that we\u2019re second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we\u2019re way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige? Well, it can only have the effect certainly of reducing it. Well let me make one thing clear. Senator Kennedy has a responsibility to criticize those things that are wrong, but he has also a responsibility to be right in his criticism. Every one of these items that I have mentioned he\u2019s been wrong \u2013 dead wrong. And for that reason he has contributed to any lack of prestige. Finally, let me say this: as far as prestige is concerned, the first place it would show up would be in the United Nations. Now Senator Kennedy has referred to the vote on Communist China. Let\u2019s look at the vote on Hungary. There we got more votes for condemning Hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year. Let\u2019s look at the reaction eh \u2013 reaction to Khrushchev and Eisenhower at the last U.N. session. Did Khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted? Not at all. The President gained. America gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it\u2019s that that keeps the prestige of America up, not running down America the way Senator Kennedy has been running her down."}

I\u2019ve served this country for fourteen years in the Congress and before that in the service. I\u2019ve just as high a devotion, just as high an opinion. What I downgrade, Mr. Nixon, is the leadership the country is getting, not the country. Now I didn\u2019t make most of the statements that you said I made. The s- I believe the Soviet Union is first in outer space. We have \u2013 may have made more shots but the size of their rocket thrust and all the rest \u2013 you yourself said to Khrushchev, \u201cYou may be ahead of us in rocket thrust but we\u2019re ahead of you in color television\u201d in your famous discussion in the kitchen. I think that color television is not as important as rocket thrust. Secondly, I didn\u2019t say we had the worst slums in the world. I said we had too many slums. And that they are bad, and we ought to do something about them, and we ought to support housing legislation which this Administration has opposed. I didn\u2019t say we had the worst education in the world. What I said was that ten years ago, we were producing twice as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union and today they\u2019re producing twice as many as we are, and that this affects our security around the world. And fourth, I believe that the polls and other studies and votes in the United Nations and anyone reading the paper and any citizen of the United States must come to the conclusion that the United States no longer carries the same image of a vital society on the move with its brightest days ahead as it carried a decade or two decades ago. Part of that is because we\u2019ve stood still here at home, because we haven\u2019t met our problems in the United States, because we haven\u2019t had a moving economy. Part of that, as the Gallup Polls show, is because the Soviet Union made a breakthrough in outer space. Mr. George Allen, head of your Information Service, has said that that made the people of the world begin to wonder whether we were first in science. We\u2019re first in other areas of science but in space, which is the new science, we\u2019re not first."}

If we fail then, if we\u2019re unable to come to an agreement \u2013 and I hope we can come to an agreement because it does not merely involve now the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as atomic powers. Because new breakthroughs in atomic energy technology there\u2019s some indications that by the time the next president\u2019s term of office has come to an end, there may be ten, fifteen, or twenty countries with an atomic capacity, perhaps that many testing bombs with all the effect that it could have on the atmosphere and with all the chances that more and more countries will have an atomic capacity, with more and more chance of war. So one more effort should be made. I don\u2019t think that even if that effort fails that it will be necessary to carry on tests in the atmosphere which pollute the atmosphere. They can be carried out underground, they c- could be carried on in outer space. But I believe the effort should be made once more by who\u2019s ever elected president of the United States. If we fail, it\u2019s been a great serious failure for everyone \u2013 for the human race. I hope we can succeed. But then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then we\u2019ll have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the United States, and there may have to be testing underground. I think the Atomic Energy Committee is prepared for it. There may be testing in outer space. I hope it will not be necessary for any power to resume uh \u2013 testing in the atmosphere. It\u2019s possible to detect those kind of tests. The kind of tests which you can\u2019t detect are underground or in \u2013 in uh \u2013 perhaps in outer space. So that I\u2019m hopeful we can try once more. If we fail then we must meet our responsibilities to ourselves. But I\u2019m most concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapons. China may have it by 1963, Egypt. War has been the constant companion of mankind, so to have these weapons disseminated around the world, I believe means that we\u2019re going to move through a period of hazard in the next few years.

There should be no tests in the atmosphere; that rules out any fall-out. But as far as underground tests for developing peaceful uses of atomic energy, we should not allow this Soviet filibuster to continue. I think it\u2019s time for them to fish or cut bait.

Uh \u2013 First of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference. This means at the secretary of state level and at the ambassadorial level. By adequate preparation I mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda, an agenda agreed upon with the approval of the heads of state involved. Now this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation. I don\u2019t believe we should go to a summit conference unless we have such an agenda, unless we have some reasonable insur- assurance from Mr. Khrushchev that he intends seriously to negotiate on those points. Now this may seem like a rigid, inflexible position. But let\u2019s look at the other side of the coin. If we build up the hopes of the world by having a summit conference that is not adequately prepared, and then, if Mr. Khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up \u2013 as he did this one \u2013 because he isn\u2019t going to get his way \u2013 we\u2019d set back the cause of peace. We do not help it. We can, in other words, negotiate many of these items of difference between us without going to the summit. I think we have to make a greater effort than we have been making at the secretary of state level, at the ambassadorial level, to work out the differences that we have. And so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit \u2013 a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it is. When I say \u201cphony spirit,\u201d I mean phony, not because the spirit is not good on our side, but because the Soviet Union simply doesn\u2019t intend to carry out what they say. Now, these are the conditions that I can lay out. I cannot be more precise than that, because until we see what Mr. Khrushchev does and what he says uh \u2013 we cannot indicate what our plans will be."}

The Soviet Union refused to agree to that, and we went to the summit and it was disastrous. I believe we should not go to the summit until there is some reason to believe that a meeting of minds can be obtained on either Berlin, outer space, or general disarmament \u2013 including nuclear testing. In addition, I believe the next president in January and February should go to work in building the strength of the United States. The Soviet Union does understand strength. We arm to parley, Winston Churchill said ten years ago. If we are strong, particularly as we face a crisis over Berlin \u2013 which we may in the spring, or in the winter \u2013 it\u2019s important that we maintain our determination here; that we indicate that we\u2019re building our strength; that we are determined to protect our position; that we\u2019re determined to protect our commitment.

In addition we can have more exchange with Poland or with any other of the Iron Curtain countries which show some desire to take a different path than the path that has been taken by the ones that are complete satellites of the Soviet Union. Now as far as the balance of the world is concerned, I of course don\u2019t have as much time as Senator Kennedy had. I would just like to s- add this one point. If we are going to have the initiative in the world, we must remember that the people of Africa and Asia and Latin America don\u2019t want to be pawns simply in a struggle between two great powers \u2013 the Soviet Union and the United States. We have to let them know that we want to help them, not because we\u2019re simply trying to save our own skins, not because we\u2019re simply trying to fight Communism; but because we care for them, because we stand for freedom, because if there were no Communism in the world, we would still fight poverty and misery and disease and tyranny. If we can get that across to the people of these countries, in this decade of the sixties, the struggle for freedom will be won."}

KENNEDY","Party":"Democratic","Factor 1":12,"Factor 2":72,"Factor 3":-4,"Factor 4":-7,"Factor 5":1,"Factor 6":-1,"Text":"I uh \u2013 said that I\u2019ve served this country for fourteen years. I served it uh \u2013 in the war. I\u2019m devoted to it. If I lose this election, I will continue in the Senate to try to build a stronger country. But I run because I believe this year the United States has a great opportunity to make a move forward, to make a determination here at home and around the world, that it\u2019s going to reestablish itself as a vigorous society. My judgment is that the Republican party has stood still here in the United States, and it\u2019s also stood still around the world. Uh \u2013 We\u2019re using about fifty percent of our steel capacity today. We had a recession in fifty-eight. We had a recession in fifty-four. We\u2019re not moving ahead in education the way we should. We didn\u2019t make a judgment in fifty-seven and fifty-six and fifty-five and fifty-four that outer space would be important. If we stand still here, if we appoint people to ambassadorships and positions in Washington who have a status quo outlook, who don\u2019t recognize that this is a revolutionary time, then the United States does not maintain its influence. And if we fail, the cause of freedom fails. I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again, to get our economy moving ahead, to set before the American people its goals, its unfinished business. And then throughout the world appoint the best people we can get, ambassadors who can speak the language \u2013 no mere \u2013 not merely people who made a political contribution but who can speak the language. Bring students here; let them see what kind of a country we have. Mr. Nixon said that we should not regard them as pawns in the cold war; we should identify ourselves with them. If that were true, why didn\u2019t we identify ourselves with the people of Africa? Why didn\u2019t we bring students over here? Why did we suddenly offer Congo three hundred students last June when they had the tremendous revolt? That was more than we had offered to all of Africa before from the federal government. I believe that this party \u2013 Republican party \u2013 has stood still really for twenty-five years \u2013 its leadership has. It opposed all of the programs of President Roosevelt and others \u2013 the minimum wage and for housing and economic growth and development of our natural resources, the Tennessee Valley and all the rest. And I believe that if we can get a party which believes in movement, which believes in going ahead, then we can reestablish our position in the world \u2013 strong defense, strong in economic growth, justice for our people, co- guarantee of constitutional rights, so that people will believe that we practice what we preach, and then around the world, particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which existed in Latin America at the time of Franklin Roosevelt. He was a good neighbor in Latin America because he was a good neighbor in the United States; because they saw us as a society that was compassionate, that cared about people, that was moving this country ahead. I believe it my responsibility as the leader of the Democratic party in 1960 to try to warn the American people that in this crucial time we can no longer afford to stand still. We can no longer afford to be second best. I want people all over the world to look to the United States again, to feel that we\u2019re on the move, to feel that our high noon is in the future. I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States, and that they\u2019re going to put this country back to work again. I don\u2019t believe that there is anything this country cannot do. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any burden, or any responsibility, that any American would not assume to protect his country, to protect our security, to advance the cause of freedom. And I believe it incumbent upon us now to do that. Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that that generation of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny. I believe in 1960 and sixty-one and two and three we have a rendezvous with destiny. And I believe it incumbent upon us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom; and to do that, we must give this country leadership and we must get America moving again."}

NIXON","Party":"Republican","Factor 1":5,"Factor 2":50,"Factor 3":1,"Factor 4":1,"Factor 5":-2,"Factor 6":3,"Text":"Senator Kennedy has said tonight again what he has said several times in the course of this \u2013 these debates and in the campaign, that American is standing still. America is not standing still. It has not been standing still. And let\u2019s set the record straight right now by looking at the record, as Al Smith used to say. He talks about housing. We built more houses in the last seven years than in any Administration and thirty percent more than in the previous Administration. We talk about schools \u2013 three times as many classrooms built in the past Administration \u2013 and Eisenhower \u2013 than under the Truman Administration. Let\u2019s talk about civil rights. More progress in the past eight years than in the whole eighty years before. He talks about the progress in the field of slum clearance and the like. We find four times as many projects undertaken and completed in this Administration than in the previous one. Anybody that says America has been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn\u2019t been traveling in America. He\u2019s been in some other country. Let\u2019s get that straight right away. Now the second point we have to understand is this, however. America has not been standing still. But America cannot stand pat. We can\u2019t stand pat for the reason that we\u2019re in a race, as I\u2019ve indicated. We can\u2019t stand pat because it is essential with the conflict that we have around the world that we not just hold our own, that we not keep just freedom for ourselves. It is essential that we extend freedom, extend it to all the world. And this means more than what we\u2019ve been doing. It means keeping America even stronger militarily than she is. It means seeing that our economy moves forward even faster than it has. It means making more progress in civil rights than we have so that we can be a splendid example for all the world to see \u2013 a democracy in action at its best. Now, looking at the other parts of the world \u2013 South America \u2013 talking about our record and the previous one. We had a good neighbor policy, yes. It sounded fine. But let\u2019s look at it. There were eleven dictators when we came into power in 1953 in Latin America. There are only three left. Let\u2019s look at Africa. Twenty new countries in Africa during the course of this Administration. Not one of them selected a Communist government. All of them voted for freedom \u2013 a free type of government. Does this show that Communism has the bigger pull, or freedom has the bigger pull? Am I trying to indicate that we have no problems in Africa or Latin America or Asia? Of course not. What I am trying to indicate is that the tide of history\u2019s on our side, and that we can keep it on our side, because we\u2019re on the right side. We\u2019re on the side of freedom. We\u2019re on the side of justice against the forces of slavery, against the forces of injustice. But we aren\u2019t going to move America forward and we aren\u2019t going to be able to lead the world to win this struggle for freedom if we have a permanent inferiority complex about American achievements. Because we are first in the world in space, as I\u2019ve indicated; we are first in science; we are first in education, and we\u2019re going to move even further ahead with the kind of leadership that we can provide in these years ahead. One other point I would make: what could you do? Senator Kennedy and I are candidates for the presidency of the United States. And in the years to come it will be written that one or the other of us was elected and that he was or was not a great president. What will determine whether Senator Kennedy or I, if I am elected, was a great president? It will not be our ambition that will determine it, because greatness is not something that is written on a campaign poster. It will be determined to the extent that we represent the deepest ideals, the highest feelings and faith of the American people. In other words, the next president, as he leads America and the free world, can be only as great as the American people are great. And so I say in conclusion, keep America\u2019s faith strong. See that the young people of America, particularly, have faith in the ideals of freedom and faith in God, which distinguishes us from the atheistic materialists who oppose us."}

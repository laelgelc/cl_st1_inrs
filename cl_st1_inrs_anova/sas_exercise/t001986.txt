I couldn’t agree more that the Iraqis want to be free and that they could be free. But I think the president, again, still hasn’t shown how he’s going to go about it the right way. He has more of the same. Now, Prime Minister Allawi came here, and he said the terrorists are pouring over the border. That’s Allawi’s assessment. The national intelligence assessment that was given to the president in July said, best-case scenario, more of the same of what we see today; worst-case scenario, civil war. I can do better.

Well, look at the budget. One is make sure Congress doesn’t overspend. But let me talk back about where we’ve been. The stock market was declining six months prior to my arrival. It was the largest stock market correction — one of the largest in history, which foretold a recession. Because we cut taxes on everybody — remember, we ran up the child credit by $1,000, we reduced the marriage penalty, we created a 10 percent bracket, everybody who pays taxes got relief — the recession was one of the shortest in our nation’s history.

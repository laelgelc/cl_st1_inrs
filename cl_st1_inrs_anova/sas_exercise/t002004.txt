I have no intention of wilting. I’ve never wilted in my life. And I’ve never wavered in my life. I know exactly what we need to do in Iraq, and my position has been consistent - Saddam Hussein is a threat. He needed to be disarmed. We needed to go to the U.N. The president needed the authority to use force in order to be able to get him to do something, because he never did it without the threat of force. But we didn’t need to rush to war without a plan to win the peace.

Well, I clearly believe that George W. Bush would be a better commander in chief. He’s already done it for four years. And he’s demonstrated, without question, the conviction, the vision, the determination to win this war against terror. He understands it’s a global conflict that reaches from the United States all the way around the globe to Jakarta. And those very special qualities are vital in a commander in chief. And I think the president has them, and I’m not at all convinced his opponent does.

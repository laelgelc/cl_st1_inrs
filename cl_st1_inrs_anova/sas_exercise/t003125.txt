Yes, I still find it very difficult to believe because in the platform, which this Republican party passed in Dallas â€“ one of the things they was they said that this position on abortion would be a litmus test, not only for Supreme Court justices but for other federal justices. That, again, seems to me a blurring of the line of the separation between church and state.

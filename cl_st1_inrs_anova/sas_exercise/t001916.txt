The vice president and president like to talk about their experience on the campaign trail. Millions of people have lost their jobs. Millions have fallen into poverty. Family incomes are down, while the cost of everything is going up. Medical costs are up the highest they’ve ever been over the last four years. We have this mess in Iraq. Mr. Vice President, I don’t think the country can take four more years of this kind of experience.

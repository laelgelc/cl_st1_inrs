Thank you. Talk about waffling around. This issue is a very important issue. It has been debated throughout your public life and throughout my public life, and one thing that I donâ€™t think that it is wise to do, and that is to change your position. At one time, and most of the time in the House of Representatives, you had a pro-life position.

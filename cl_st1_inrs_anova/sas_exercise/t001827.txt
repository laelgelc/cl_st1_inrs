Yes, that’s a great question. Thanks. I hear there’s rumors on the Internets (sic) that we’re going to have a draft. We’re not going to have a draft, period. The all- volunteer army works. It works particularly when we pay our troops well. It works when we make sure they’ve got housing, like we have done in the last military budgets. An all-volunteer army is best suited to fight the new wars of the 21st century, which is to be specialized and to find these people as they hide around the world. We don’t need mass armies anymore. One of the things we’ve done is we’ve taken the — we’re beginning to transform our military. And by that I mean we’re moving troops out of Korea and replacing them with more effective weapons. We don’t need as much manpower on the Korean Peninsula to keep a deterrent. In Europe, we have massed troops as if the Soviet Union existed and was going to invade into Europe, but those days are over with. And so we’re moving troops out of Europe and replacing it with more effective equipment. So to answer your question is, we’re withdrawing, not from the world, we’re withdrawing manpower so they can be stationed here in America, so there’s less rotation, so life is easier on their families and therefore more likely to be — we’ll be more likely to be able to keep people in the all-volunteer army. One of the more important things we’re doing in this administration is transformation. There are some really interesting technologies. For instance, we’re flying unmanned vehicles that can send real- time messages back to stations in the United States. That saves manpower, and it saves equipment. It also means that we can target things easier and move more quickly, which means we need to be lighter and quicker and more facile and highly trained. Now, forget all this talk about a draft. We’re not going to have a draft so long as I am the president.

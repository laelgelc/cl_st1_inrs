The United Nations, Kofi Annan offered help after Baghdad fell. And we never picked him up on that and did what was necessary to transfer authority and to transfer reconstruction. It was always American-run. Secondly, when we went in, there were three countries - Great Britain, Australia and the United States. Thatâ€™s not a grand coalition. We can do better.

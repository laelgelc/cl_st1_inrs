It’s an issue I know a lot about. I was a small oil person for a while in west Texas. This is an administration that’s had no plan. And all of a sudden the results of having no plan have caught up with America. First and foremost we have to fully fund LIHEAP which is a way to help low income folks, particularly here in the east to pay for high fuel bills. Secondly, we need an active exploration program in America. The only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home. You bet I want to open up a small part of Alaska. When that field is online it will produce one million barrels a day. Today we import one million barrels from Saddam Hussein. I would rather that a million come from our own hemisphere, our own country as opposed to Saddam Hussein. I want to build more pipelines to move natural gas throughout this hemisphere. I want to develop the coal resources in America. Have clean coal technologies. Weâ€™ve got abundant supplies of energy here in America and weâ€™d better get after it, we better start exploring it or otherwise we’ll be in deep trouble in the future because of our dependency upon foreign sources of crude.

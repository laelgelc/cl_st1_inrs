Well, the president’s own CIA director says Saddam is stronger now than he was. I don’t understand extending the no-fly zone in the south when the trouble was in the north. And what we’ve done during the Bush administration, the Kurds were at the State Department, negotiating, trying to work their differences out. Now we’ve got all thousands and thousands of refugees. We’re even shipping 3,000 Kurds to Guam. It involves Turkey. It’s a real problem. Saddam is probably about as strong as he ever was. We shot, what, 44 cruise missiles, worth about a million-two a piece, and hit some radar, that repaired in a couple, three days. Did we inflict any damage? No. Did we have any allies helping? Well, we have Great Britain. They’re always very loyal to us, and I appreciate that. And of course Kuwait. Even though they had to find out they had 5,000 troops coming, they didn’t even understand that. We had to get their permission. The bottom line is, we went in there alone. We are supposed to be operating under a U.N. resolution. We did it without any of our allies that helped in the Gulf.

Good. You looked at me like my clock was up. I think that the way to grow this economy is to keep taxes low, is have an energy plan, is to have litigation reform. As I told you, we’ve just got a report that said over the past 13 months, we’ve created 1.9 million new jobs. Weâ€™re growing. And so the fundamental question of this campaign is - Who’s going to keep the economy growing so people can work? That’s the fundamental question.

I appreciate that. I really don’t think your rights are being watered down. As a matter of fact, I wouldn’t support it if I thought that. Every action being taken against terrorists requires court order, requires scrutiny. As a matter of fact, the tools now given to the terrorist fighters are the same tools that we’ve been using against drug dealers and white-collar criminals. So I really don’t think so. I hope you don’t think that. I mean, I — because I think whoever is the president must guard your liberties, must not erode your rights in America. The Patriot Act is necessary, for example, because parts of the FBI couldn’t talk to each other. The intelligence-gathering and the law-enforcement arms of the FBI just couldn’t share intelligence under the old law. And that didn’t make any sense. Our law enforcement must have every tool necessary to find and disrupt terrorists at home and abroad before they hurt us again. That’s the task of the 21st century. And so, I don’t think the Patriot Act abridges your rights at all. And I know it’s necessary. I can remember being in upstate New York talking to FBI agents that helped bust a Lackawanna cell up there. And they told me they could not have performed their duty, the duty we all expect of them, if they did not have the ability to communicate with each other under the Patriot Act.

On the 2nd debate, I offered, since both sides want the enterprise zones and we can’t get together, I said I’ll take a few days off and go to Washington and hold hands with you and we’ll get it done. I’ll take a few days off and hold hands with you and get this airlines thing straightened, because that’s important to this country. That’s kind of pathetic I have to do it — and nobody’s called me yet to come up, I might mention. (Laughter)

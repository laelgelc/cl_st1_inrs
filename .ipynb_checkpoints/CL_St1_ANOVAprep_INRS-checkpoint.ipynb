We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all. Top, top academic, good in every way. Good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think sheâ€™s going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself. I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding. Sheâ€™s going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that. We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, said sheâ€™s the single greatest student heâ€™s ever had. Heâ€™s been a professor for a long time at a great school. And we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise. And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldnâ€™t even think about not doing it. The only difference is theyâ€™d try and do it faster. Thereâ€™s no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didnâ€™t have the election so they were stopped. And probably that would happen in reverse, also. Definitely would happen in reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris.\n"

       "'Thank you very much, Chris. I will tell you very simply. We won the election. Elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all. Top, top academic, good in every way. Good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think sheâ€™s going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself. I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding. Sheâ€™s going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that. We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, said sheâ€™s the single greatest student heâ€™s ever had. Heâ€™s been a professor for a long time at a great school. And we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise. And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldnâ€™t even think about not doing it. The only difference is theyâ€™d try and do it faster. Thereâ€™s no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didnâ€™t have the election so they were stopped. And probably that would happen in reverse, also. Definitely would happen in reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris. Well, first of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, Mr. President. The American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for United States Senators and when they vote for the President of United States. Theyâ€™re not going to get that chance now because weâ€™re in the middle of an election already. The election has already started. Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because thatâ€™s the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President. Now, whatâ€™s at stake here is the Presidentâ€™s made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Heâ€™s been running on that, he ran on that and heâ€™s been governing on that. Heâ€™s in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court. And the justice, Iâ€™m not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. But sheâ€™s written, before she went in the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not Constitutional. The other thing thatâ€™s on the court, and if itâ€™s struck down, what happens? Womenâ€™s rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. Theyâ€™re able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets. And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and thereâ€™s a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and theyâ€™ll be taken away as well. Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. And so itâ€™s just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the Senate is Republican, then he goes forward. If not, we should wait until February. There arenâ€™t a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions. As far as a say is concerned, the people already had their say. Okay, Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully, very strongly, at some point 10 years ago or so, she said a President and the Senate is elected for a period of time, but a President is elected for four years. Weâ€™re not elected for three years. Iâ€™m not elected for three years. So we have the Senate, we have a President- During that period of time, during that period of time, we have an opening. Iâ€™m not elected for three years. Iâ€™m elected for four years. Joe, the hundred million people is totally wrong. I donâ€™t know where you got that number. The bigger problem that you have is that youâ€™re going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care, that theyâ€™re very happy with. Well, youâ€™re certainly going to socialist. Youâ€™re going to socialist medicine- Number one, he knows what I proposed. What I proposed is that we expand Obamacare and we increase it. We do not wipe any. And one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won, were saying that Biden wanted to allow people to have private insurance still. They can. They do. They will under my proposal. Thatâ€™s not what youâ€™ve said and itâ€™s not what your party is saying. Your party doesnâ€™t say it. Your party wants to go socialist medicine and socialist healthcare. The party is me. Right now, I am the Democratic Party.'"
